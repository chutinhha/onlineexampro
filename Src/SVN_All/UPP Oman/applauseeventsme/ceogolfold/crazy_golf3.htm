					<b>The amazing golf ball<br>
                    </b><br>
                    A golfer, playing a round by himself, is about to tee off, 
                    and a greasy little salesman runs up to him, and yells, 
                    &quot;Wait! Before you tee off, I have something really amazing 
                    to show you!&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    The golfer, annoyed, says, &quot;What is it?&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;It's a special golf ball,&quot; says the salesman. &quot;You can 
                    never lose it!&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;What do you mean,&quot; scoffs the golfer, &quot;you can never lose 
                    it? What if you hit it into the water?&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;No problem,&quot; says the salesman. &quot;It floats, and it detects 
                    where the shore is, and spins towards it.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Well, what if you hit it into the woods?&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Easy,&quot; says the salesman. &quot;It emits a beeping sound, and 
                    you can find it with your eyes closed.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Okay,&quot; says the golfer, impressed. &quot;But what if your round 
                    goes late and it gets dark?&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;No problem, sir, this golf ball glows in the dark! I'm 
                    telling you, you can never lose this golf ball!&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    The golfer buys it at once. &quot;Just one question,&quot; he says to 
                    the salesman. &quot;Where did you get it?&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I found it.&quot;</font><p align="right" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 4px">

					<b>Tee Time<br>
                    </b><br>
                    Tom was a man of faith, and a man of the golf course. He 
                    played golf every Sunday religiously, but only after 
                    attending church services.<br>
                    <br>
                    Tom was getting on in years, and one day after feeling ill, 
                    he said to his wife, &quot;I sure hope there is golf in the 
                    afterlife. I feel terrible!&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    His wife told him not to overreact with talk about the 
                    afterlife. &quot;Go to church and say a little prayer,&quot; she 
                    suggested, &quot;and you'll feel better.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    So Tom headed to church. As he kneeled at the pew, Tom 
                    whispered a prayer: &quot;Oh Lord, thank you for everything - my 
                    health, my wife and my golf game. I hope that when I reach 
                    Heaven I can still play golf.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    As soon as he finished, a voice thundered: &quot;Tom, this is the 
                    Lord. I hear you and will answer your question. Do you want 
                    the good news or the bad news first?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Tom was startled. &quot;Well, give me the good news,&quot; he said.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Lord replied, &quot;The good news is that in Heaven, we have 
                    thousands of championship golf courses, play is never slow, 
                    it's always free and you will never lose a golf ball.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Tom was ecstatic, &quot;That's wonderful! You've answered my 
                    prayer! But what is the bad news?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    The Lord replied, &quot;You tee off tomorrow at 9 a.m.&quot;

					<b>The Worst Caddie<br>
                    </b><br>
                    Bill and his assigned caddie started off the first tee of 
                    the fancy resort course Bill was playing. It was his first 
                    time using a caddie, and he was excited. <br>
                    <br>
                    But by the eighth hole, Bill was already 24 over par. He had 
                    lost 9 balls in water hazards. And trying to hack his way 
                    out of the rough, Bill had dug a trench a foot deep.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then, on the No. 9 green, Bill was standing over a 1-foot 
                    putt when his caddie coughed right in the middle of his 
                    stroke. Bill exploded.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;You must be the worst caddie in the history of golf!&quot; Bill 
                    screamed.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I doubt it,&quot; the caddie replied. &quot;That'd be too much of a 
                    coincidence.&quot;</font><p align="right" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 4px">

					<b>Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods<br>
                    </b><br>
                    Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods are playing the 16th hole, 
                    when Tiger's tee shot lands behind a huge, 100 foot fir 
                    tree. Tiger looks at Arnie and says, &quot;How would you play 
                    this one? Lay up and take the extra stroke?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Arnold replies: &quot;When I was your age, I'd just play right 
                    over this tree.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Tiger, not wanting to be shown up by ol' Arnold Palmer, 
                    proceeds to hit the ball high, but not high enough. It 
                    bounces off the tree and lands out of bounds. Tiger, really 
                    ticked at this point, asks Arnold how he EVER hit a ball 
                    over that tree.<br>
                    <br>
                    Arnold replied: &quot;Well, when I was your age, that tree was 
                    only three feet tall.&quot;</font><p align="right" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 4px">

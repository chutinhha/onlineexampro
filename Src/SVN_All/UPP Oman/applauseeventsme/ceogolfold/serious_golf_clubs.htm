              <font style="font-size: 8pt" face="Verdana" color="#EEEEEE"><b>Fairway Woods</b><br>
              <br>
              Woods are the longest clubs in the bag and mostly used for long 
              shots. They have large heads that are somewhat spherical in shape 
              with a slightly bulging clubface and a flattened sole that slides 
              over the ground without digging in during the swing. Originally 
              the &quot;wood&quot; heads were made of persimmon or maple wood, hence the 
              name. Modern club heads are usually made of hollow steel, titanium 
              or composite materials, and are also called metalwoods. The first 
              steel metalwoods were filled with foam in order to ensure 
              structural stability.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Drivers</b><br>
              <br>
              The longest wood, the 1 wood, is usually referred to as the 
              driver. It also has the biggest head, making it ideal for use off 
              the tee. The shorter woods (today, the 3 and 5 woods are most 
              commonly used, with 2, 4, 7 and 9 woods occasionally used) are 
              referred to as fairway woods, and feature a shallower face height 
              which enables players to hit them off the turf. The driver can 
              also be hit from the turf, although it requires a high level of 
              skill to execute the shot correctly.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Irons<br>
              </b><br>
              Irons are used for shorter shots than woods, usually shots 
              approaching the greens. Irons are the most versatile clubs in the 
              bag, allowing advanced players to hit a variety of different shots 
              with the same club. Irons usually range from numbers 1 to 9, with 
              lower numbered irons having lower lofts.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Hybrid</b><br>
              <br>
              A new type of wood known as a &quot;hybrid&quot; combines the straight 
              hitting characteristics of irons with the low centre of gravity 
              characteristics of higher lofted woods. These clubs are also known 
              as &quot;rescue clubs&quot;. A hybrid golf club is about 2/3 the size of a 
              standard oversize fairway wood and will often maintain deeper 
              grooves as compared to a fairway wood which will have more shallow 
              grooves. A &quot;hybrid&quot; is often used for long shots from difficult 
              rough and for nearly any shot where the golfer feels uncomfortable 
              using a long iron<br>
              <br>
              <b>Wedges</b><br>
              <br>
              Wedges are irons that usually have a loft of more than 44 degrees. 
              Pitching wedges have a loft of 44-50 degrees and are rather 
              similar to other irons. Sand wedges have specially designed 
              undersides that use a feature known as &quot;bounce&quot;, which combined 
              with a loft of 54-58 degrees make them suitable for shots from 
              bunkers or from the rough. Gap wedges represent a compromise 
              between a pitching wedge and sand wedge—hence the name. Lob wedges 
              have a very high loft (up to 68 degrees) and are used for approach 
              shots, from sand, or difficult recovery shots requiring an 
              extraordinarily high shot and short distance. Most golf club 
              manufacturers now offer most lofts between 48 and 60 degrees, in a 
              large variety of bounces.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Putters</b><br>
              <br>
              Putters come in a variety of head shapes and have a very low loft 
              and often a short shaft, designed to 'push' and roll the ball 
              rather than hitting it up into the air. They are used to play the 
              ball on the green, but may occasionally be useful for playing some 
              approach shots on courses with tightly mown fringe and fairways.</font><p align="right" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 4px">

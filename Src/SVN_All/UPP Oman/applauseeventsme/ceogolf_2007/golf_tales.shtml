            Killer Drive </b><br>
            In 1934 at St Margaret's-at-Cliffe Golf Club, Kent, WJ Robinson, the 
            club professional, hit a drive on the 18th hole which resulted in 
            hitting a cow in the back of the head. When Robinson and his playing 
            partners reached the heifer, she was, amazingly, dead. <br>
            <b><br>
            Oops! </b><br>
            In the 1932 Walker Cup, legendary Cambridge Blue Leonard Crawley hit 
            a wayward shot into the 18th green which resulted in hitting the 
            actual Walker Cup trophy, putting a dent into it. <br>
            <b><br>
            Big Hitter </b><br>
            In the 1992 Texas Open, at San Antonio's Oak Hills C.C., journeyman 
            pro Carl Hooper ripped a drive that wound up hitting a cart path and 
            continuing on for 787 yards. After returning to the fairway by 
            hitting a 4 iron and then an 8 iron, Cooper took a double bogey 6, 
            and missed the cut. <br>
            <b><br>
            Big Field </b><br>
            The 1978 PGA Colgate Championship had the largest field for a 
            European Tour event with 398 players having teed it up. Seven years 
            later, in 1985, all European professional events were limited to 144 
            players. <br>
            <b><br>
            Slow Down Boys! </b><br>
            Mark Calcavecchia and John Daly were both fined by the US Tour for 
            playing too quickly. They completed the final round in the 
            Tournament Players' Championship in 2 hours and 3 minutes. Daly 
            fired an 80 and Calcavecchia an 81. <br>
            <b><br>
            Only 1 Hole in 1! </b><br>
            Legendary professional Harry Vardon, the greatest Open Champion of 
            all-time, had only one hole-in-one during his long career. <br>
            <b><br>
            Expensive Lake Balls! </b><br>
            Scotland's Raymond Russell had high hopes of a top-10 position going 
            into the last round of the 2001 Compass English Open at the Marriott 
            Forest of Arden course. However, these hopes were ruined at the 17th 
            green when he threw his ball to the caddie for cleaning. The caddie 
            took his eye off the ball, missed it and watched in horror as the 
            little round fella rolled into the lake. Unfortunately it couldn't 
            be found in the murky depths, the result was a two-stroke penalty 
            and £4,500 in prize money! <br>
            <b><br>
            Unusual Tactics </b><br>
            Standing on the final tee in a professional event, legendary 
            Canadian ball-striker Moe Norman was informed by his caddy that all 
            he needed to do to break the course record was to hit a driver, a 9 
            iron and take two putts. After informing his caddy of his intended 
            tactics, he proceeded to hit a 9 iron off the tee, a driver off the 
            fairway to the green, and took two putts to successfully break the 
            course record. <br>
            <b><br>
            Consistent Play </b><br>
            In the final round of the 1987 Open Championship at Muirfield, Nick 
            Faldo took a par on every hole to take the title. <br>
            <b><br>
            How Many? </b><br>
            The biggest number ever posted in a professional event is a 
            staggering 23 by Tommy Armour in the 1927 Shawnee Open. The previous 
            week Armour won the American Open Championship. <br>
            <b><br>
            Missed the fairway? </b><br>
            1995 a local member at a Lancashire Club sadly passed away. He was 
            famous throughout the region as a wonderful straight hitter and won 
            more club tournaments than anyone else in its history. His dying 
            wish was for his ashes to be scattered on his beloved first fairway 
            and his fellow members planned to honour this wish. However, as the 
            ashes were scattered on the day of the ceremony a gust of wind blew 
            them out of bounds where they came to rest in a raspberry bush - the 
            only time he had ever visited the spot! <br>

            Robber holds up golf tournament </b><br>
            A golf tournament was held up in Australia when an armed robber 
            drove onto the course in a stolen truck. Golfers were stranded after 
            police declared the sixth hole a crime scene and refused to let 
            players through. The robber crashed onto the course during the NSW 
            Amateur Championship at Ryde-Parramatta Golf Club. The man, who had 
            allegedly just held up a supermarket, rammed through a fence and 
            onto the fifth fairway. Scattering startled players, he hurtled down 
            the hole and into a bunker before becoming stuck. The man, 
            brandishing a shotgun and gripping a bag, then fled into a nearby 
            empty house. As police helicopters hovered overhead and 25 police 
            cars rushed onto the course, a two-hour siege developed before the 
            man finally surrendered. </font>

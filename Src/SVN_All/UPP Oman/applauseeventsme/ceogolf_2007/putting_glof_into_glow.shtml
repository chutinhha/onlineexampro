			‘Putting’ Glow into golf<br>
            </b><br>
            OER CEO Golf truly lived up to its reputation – unmatched décor, 
            unique informal gathering of the distinguished and the powerful, and 
            above all, new to Oman – glow golf, taking this premier annual 
            networking event to new heights <br>
            <br>
            It was a day memories are made of. OER CEO Golf 2006 not only put 
            the glitz into golf, but also managed to grip Muscat with golfing 
            fever. Branded as “the biggest networking event” of the country, 
            March 23 saw the coming together of the crème de la crème of Oman’s 
            top business leaders in relaxed surroundings for some fun on the 
            fairways.<br>
            <br>
            Chief executive officers, general managers, directors and other top 
            management came, saw and putted. The culmination of months’ worth of 
            preparation and anticipation, the day was designed to be as serious, 
            as much fun, and as much of a networking opportunity as each 
            participant decided to make it. <br>
            Everybody who is anybody in the Sultanate’s corporate world had 
            managed to keep the day free and was looking forward to hitting a 
            few balls around with friends. Amidst a lot of fun and cheering, the 
            branded logo of the event, suspended from a cloud of balloons, was 
            released into the blue skies above Muscat signaling the event 
            inauguration. Then, the 200-plus strong crowd - wearing branded 
            T-shirts and golfing caps – watched as His Highness Sayyid Tarik bin 
            Shabib, editor-in-chief of Oman Economic Review (OER); His 
            Excellency Dr. Mohammad bin Hamad Al Rumhy, Minister of Oil and Gas 
            and; Dr. Amer Rawas, Managing Director of Oman Mobile and tee-off to 
            officially open the day’s events.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Shotgun Start<br>
            </b><br>
            Appropriately, the shotgun start forewent guns and fireworks, but 
            used the horn of the impressive black Dodge Durango – up for grabs 
            for the first player who managed to get a hole-in-one – as the 
            starting sound for the day’s championship round of golf. Seasoned 
            and experienced golfers, some 60 of them, set off in groups of four 
            to play for the trophies.<br>
            <br>
            Holes 10 to 18 of the Ghallah Wentworth Golf Club, stretching over a 
            total of 3,037 metres, made up the 9-hole challenge that was scored 
            using the Stableford system, taking three handicap categories into 
            account. This was the ‘serious’ part of the day, with several 
            sought-after prizes to be won. Not only could the overall nett 
            champion take home a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch, but many other 
            prestigious prizes were up for grabs as well. The atmosphere was 
            buzzing with enthusiastic and friendly competition. To add to the 
            excitement, a golf quiz was conducted offering one year membership 
            to the Muscat Golf and Country Club sponsored by Muscat Golf Course 
            Project.<br>
            <br>
            Although golf is the most popular leisure and networking activity of 
            the business elite, not everybody has had a chance to get into the 
            game yet. After all, being the captain of a successful business 
            usually does not leave much leisure time. So, to cater for those who 
            wanted to learn a little more about golf, OER set up a golf clinic 
            to run at the same time as the serious round of golf was in 
            progress.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Cool Clinic<br>
            </b><br>
            Brandon de Souza, Managing Director of Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM) 
            and a professional golfer himself, and Digraj Singh, Director of TSM, 
            top amateur golfer in the 1970s and former member of a 
            gold-medal-winning team at the SAARC golf championship, imparted 
            lessons on the most important techniques to over 100 golf-beginners. 
            Lessons on swing basics and long game kept them busy for a while.<br>
            <br>
            After the coaching sessions, the participants were grouped into 25 
            teams of four players, each player of each team specializing in one 
            of the four newly acquired skills. There was the skills competition, 
            with prizes for first, second and third team in the points scoring, 
            as well as individual prizes for the winner of each category of 
            skill.<br>
            <br>
            Both the championship round of golf and the golf clinic with its 
            competition finished in the late afternoon, giving the participants 
            time to relax and chat before getting ready for the quiz, which 
            tested the golfers’ knowledge about the game and brought the lucky 
            winner a one-year free membership to the Muscat Golf and Country 
            Club.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Night Spectacle<br>
            </b><br>
            Then, upon nightfall, it was time for the most eagerly awaited event 
            of the day: Glow Golf. The scene was spectacularly set: Chinese 
            lanterns lit up the fairways between holes 15 and 18 for the 
            experienced golfers and the putting green by the driving range for 
            the novices. The individual pins, or flags, of each hole were aglow, 
            and even the cups into which the equally glowing golf balls were to 
            be hit, were lit up. <br>
            <br>
            Lasers illuminated the night sky and the golfers and their spouses 
            were adorned with phosphorescent necklaces, making for an eerie as 
            well as spectacular set up. It was a chance to participate in a 
            unique event never seen before in Oman. The ever-lasting memories 
            were formed in a very special and grand atmosphere that had every 
            participant thrilled to have been part of the day. <br>
            <br>
            Sheikh Essa bin Mohammed Al Zedjali, chairman and editor-in-chief of 
            Times of Oman and Al Shabiba, teed-off for the start of the 
            glow-golf and all participants had a great time, enjoying a few 
            swings and shots of golf with a difference. After the glow golf, 
            dinner, live-entertainment, and the prize-giving ceremony were the 
            next eagerly awaited items on the full itinerary, especially 
            considering the amazing prizes that were up for grabs. <br>
            <br>
            At the end of the day, a relaxed crowd watched as Dr. Rawas, 
            Managing Director of Oman Mobile, presented the OER CEO Golf 2006 
            Champion’s Trophy to the nett individual winner of the day, Fudli 
            Talyar Khan, managing partner, Al Kawther United Establishment. Anil 
            Khimji of Khimji Watches gifted the Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch to 
            the champion. The gross individual winner was Sachin Bawa, CEO, 
            Shanfari Group of Companies, who also took home the OER CEO Golf 
            2006 Champion’s Trophy as well as a prize.<br>
            During the presentations, the special collector’s edition of OER’s 
            TEE TIME was launched and exhibited by HH Sayyid Tarik bin Shabib. 
            Sandeep Sehgal, General Manager of United Media Services, said of 
            the event: “In view of the wonderful response to the event, I am 
            confident that OER CEO Golf will continue to be a regular, 
            must-attend fixture on the business and social calendar in Oman.”
            <br>
            <br>
            He added: “For months now, the corporate world was buzzing with 
            anticipation, and I believe that the day was an appropriate climax 
            to the months of preparation of the OER CEO Golf team, and 
            expectations of the corporate community.”<br>
            <br>
            Keep your diary free for next year’s event! Who knows you might when 
            a trip to Sun City in South Africa.<br>

            <a name="top">Playing</a> The Game <br>
            </b><br>
            As stated earlier, the objective of the game is to complete each 
            hole in as few strokes as possible.<br>
            <br>
            Before you start the round, it is advisable to perform some warm-up 
            exercises. The game may look simple but takes a heavy toll on 
            certain muscles and body parts. One of the biggest mistakes amateur 
            golfers do is play a round without warming up.<br>
            <br>
            After you pay the green fee, the charge levied by golf courses on 
            the golfers for playing a round, you are given a tee time to start 
            your round. The beauty of golf is you can play alone, or form a 
            twoball with a friend, or a threesome with two partners. You can 
            even have a fourball.<br>
            <br>
            You are normally expected to start your round from the first tee, 
            though you can start from any hole on the course and complete the 18 
            holes thereafter.<br>
            <br>
            The first person to hit the ball from the tee is said to have the 
            honour. The honour keeps changing and whichever player has the best 
            score on a particular hole, gets the honour of teeing off first on 
            the next hole.<br>
            <br>
            The first shot hit on any particular hole from the tee area is 
            called the tee shot. Depending on the length of the hole and the 
            distance you wish to cover, you can use anything from a driver to 
            the pitching wedge for a tee shot. The choice of clubs depends on 
            various factors, including the wind. On the par-3 fifth hole of the 
            famous Pebble Beach, which measures just 106 yards, the wind from 
            the sea can make you choose a pitching wedge on one day, and a 
            five-iron on another.<br>
            <br>
            Once you hit your tee shot, you have to hit your second shot from 
            the fairway or the rough area wherever your tee shot has landed. The 
            first rule of golf is that you have to play the ball as it lies. A 
            lie of the ball is the way the ball is placed. You can have a good 
            lie if the ball is sitting up on the fairway grass, or you can have 
            a bad lie if the ball is embedded in the bunker sand or is hiding in 
            thick rough.<br>
            <br>
            Depending on the length of the hole, your second shot, or for that 
            matter any shot which is hit toward the green, is called the 
            approach shot. Normally, the course designers make the approach to 
            the green tough by placing bunkers in the vicinity of the green. A 
            good approach shot lands on the green, preferably very close to the 
            pinflag, after carrying all the hazards.<br>
            <br>
            Once you are on the green, you need to use your putter to roll the 
            ball into the hole. This is called putting and is one of the most 
            frustrating parts of the game. While on the green, you should be 
            able to sink the ball into the cup in one putt, or at the most two. 
            The worst feeling in golf is when you need three putts to complete 
            the hole. That's what the pros call three-putting the hole.<br>
            <br>
            Another commonly used term in golf is Greens in Regulations (GIR) or 
            simply Regulations. By conventional standards, a good golfer should 
            reach the green in two strokes less than the par of the hole. So, if 
            the par for the hole is five and the player is on the green in three 
            strokes, he is said to have reached the Green in Regulation. 
            Similarly the GIR for a par-4 hole is if you reach the green with 
            your second shot. The remaining two shots are kept for putting. 
            Hence a good golfer is one who reaches the greens in regulation and 
            makes two putts for a par. A very good golfer shaves off strokes 
            from the GIR and putts, and hence makes a birdie or an eagle on the 
            hole.<br>
            <br>
            Your own playing skill can be divided in two parts - the long game 
            and the short game. The long game generally involves shots with the 
            driver, woods and from 1- to 7-iron. The important thing in the long 
            game is your accuracy and how you can make the ball behave with your 
            shot. You can either draw the ball (move the ball slightly from 
            right to left in the middle of its flight path), or fade it (move 
            from left to right).<br>
            <br>
            The short game comprises the use of putter, wedges and 8-9 irons. 
            This is mostly near the green area. The general belief among the 
            golfers is that you need to have an excellent short game to make a 
            good score.<br>
            <br>
            Putting is a true art form where you have to judge the speed of the 
            surface, take into account the contours of the green and how much 
            the ball will break and on which side, as well as the direction in 
            which the grass is growing.<br>
            <br>
            Good Pitching (shots with your pitching wedge) and chipping (tender, 
            gentle shot from about 50 yards from the green) help you set a good, 
            short putt. Depending on the state of the green, you may decide to 
            use the lob wedge which sends the ball high and helps you hold it on 
            the green.<br>
            <br>
            Once you have good overall command on your game, you can either make 
            pars (taking the same number of strokes to complete the hole as is 
            the par for that hole), birdies (one less than the par), eagles (two 
            less than the par - mostly on par-5s where you reach the green in 
            two shots and sink your first putt, but also possible on par-4s 
            where you hole your second shot), or even albatross (three less than 
            the par or when you hole your second shot on a par-5 or make a 
            hole-in-one on a par-4 which is very rare). But if you are not very 
            good, you can end up making bogies (one over the par), double bogey 
            (two over the par), triple bogey and so on.<br>
            <br>
            At the end of 18 holes, you total up your score and that is your 
            gross score for the round. If you have taken 80 strokes to complete 
            a par-72 course, you have effectively played an eight-over par 
            round. But if you take 66 strokes to complete the round, then you 
            need to be in the company of Tiger Woods for playing a sub-par round 
            of six-under 66. </font>

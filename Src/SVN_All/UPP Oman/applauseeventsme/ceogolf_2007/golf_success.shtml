			GOLF + 
            <a name="top">SUCCESS</a></b><br>
            <br>
            <b>How to succeed in business - on the course and off </b><br>
            <br>
            One of the great things about playing a round of golf with someone 
            is that you find out what that person is like. How people play the 
            game and handle its many challenges (mental as well as physical) can 
            tell you a lot about whether they're comfortable with themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            The worst thing you can do is to pretend to be a good golfer when 
            you're not. The people you're playing with are going to evaluate 
            your personality -- not your golf game. Are you an enjoyable person 
            to spend four to five hours with? If you're not a good player, 
            accept that you're not and know that it's not a big deal. Here are a 
            few helpful principles to help you achieve success on the golf 
            course and in the workplace.<br>
            <b><br>
            HAVE NO FEAR</b><br>
            Nothing stymies a person's ability to play golf well or excel in 
            business more than fear. To be successful you have to get past the 
            fear of failure, the fear of rejection, and the fear of ridicule. 
            When you step onto the course, play to play great. Don't play not to 
            fail. <br>
            <b><br>
            SEIZE THE MOMENT</b><br>
            Live in the present. This means stop judging how you're doing and 
            predicting how you're going to do. Instead of thinking about what 
            you need to shoot on a hole to break a scoring goal, play one shot 
            at a time. If you have that state of mind the entire round, you have 
            a better chance at success.<br>
            <b><br>
            BE YOURSELF</b><br>
            Tour players need to have a feeling and belief about themselves that 
            they're the best at what they do. They have to admire their game 
            more than anybody else's. It's the same for business executives. To 
            succeed it's important to love your talent, your company, and your 
            role within the company.<br>
            <b><br>
            KEEP YOUR COOL</b><br>
            There's a good chance that if you lose your temper playing golf, 
            you'll lose it doing other things. And if you treat your caddie 
            lousy, you'll likely treat your employees lousy. And if you cheat at 
            golf, you might cheat at life. Always keep your cool and act like a 
            professional.<br>
            <b><br>
            BE MORE EFFICIENT</b><br>
            A golfer might succeed and get better by outworking everybody else. 
            After that, it becomes who can get in the quality practice and who 
            can become more efficient. That also applies to executives. After a 
            few years you learn how your business works. To get better you have 
            a choice: You can either work 15-hour days, or you can become more 
            efficient. Highly successful people become very efficient. They 
            increase the quality instead of the quantity. They become better 
            strategists rather than workaholics. They learn to focus on what 
            they're doing. They get past the interruptions that distract other 
            people. It's the same way with golfers. They make sure they spend 
            ample time practicing the clubs they use most. A good golfer may 
            love to hit 5-irons, but he knows he has to learn to have fun 
            practicing the clubs that are going to help him score, like the 
            putter and wedges. <br>
            <b><br>
            HOW TO TALK BUSINESS</b><br>
            A lot of deals are made on the golf course, but most good players 
            would rather play golf when it's time to play golf and talk business 
            afterward. The best time to talk business is after everyone has hit 
            their tee shots until it is the first person's turn to hit a second 
            shot. After everyone has hit their approach shots, it's O.K. to talk 
            business until you get to the green. Remember, the 20 seconds before 
            a person hits a shot until the ball hits the ground is a sacred 
            moment. And if you enjoy needling your partner, wait until after he 
            hits his shot.<br>
            <b><br>
            GET PAST REJECTION</b><br>
            Golfers have to commit to seeing the ball go toward the target or a 
            putt go into the hole even though more than half the time it 
            doesn't. Even the best players in the world with unbelievable talent 
            and skill fail. Once they get outside six feet on the putting green, 
            tour players miss more than they make. The challenge is to keep 
            seeing it go in the hole regardless of the result. People in 
            business should think the same way. Approach each day in a great 
            state of mind. Love the challenge of what you do. Accept the fact 
            that everybody who is successful has been rejected. <br>
            <b><br>
            LEARN TO EVOLVE</b><br>
            Golfers have had to adjust to the changing technology of golf 
            equipment -- better golf balls and larger, hotter drivers. People in 
            business have to change and adapt, too. There are fundamentals you 
            don't change, because they're crucial to success. </font>

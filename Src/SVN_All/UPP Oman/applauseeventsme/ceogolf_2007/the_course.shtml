			THE 
            <a name="top">COURSE</a></b><br>
            <br>
            To play golf, you need a golf course. A golf course generally 
            comprises 18 holes. Though there are plenty of nine-hole courses as 
            well. A round of golf is complete when you play the entire 18 holes.<br>
            <br>
            A hole starts from the tee area, from where you hit your first shot, 
            and ends at a green, where the actual hole is located into which you 
            have to put your ball. Each hole on a course is of fixed length. It 
            can be 167 yards from tee to green, or 356 yards or even 575 yards.<br>
            <br>
            Depending on the length of the hole, you are designated certain 
            number of strokes to complete it. That's call 'par' of the hole. A 
            short hole can be par-3, a medium length hole can be par-4, while 
            longer holes are par-5. A good player is expected to complete the 
            hole in that many strokes, or even lesser.<br>
            <br>
            If the pars of all the holes are counted, it generally adds up to 
            72. That's called the par of the course. You can even have a par-70 
            or a par-73 course. A typical 18-hole course has four par-3s, four 
            par-5s and 10 par-4s, though this may differ from course to course.
            <br>
            <br>
            The area between the tee and green is called the fairway. It is 
            expected that you hit your shots into the fairway. If you are not 
            accurate, you might end in the rough (area around the fairway where 
            the grass is kept longer thus making your shot difficult), or bushes 
            and trees which can hinder you shot towards the green.<br>
            <br>
            To make the hole even more difficult, you have man-made or natural 
            'hazards'. The most common are the 'sand traps' or 'bunkers' (an 
            area dug up and filled with sand) and water hazards (natural or 
            man-made ponds, lakes, ditches or canals). Playing a shot from the 
            bunker is lot more difficult than playing it from the fairway. But 
            if you enter a pond, you either play from inside the water, or take 
            penalty drop, thus losing strokes. <br>
            <br>
            On the green area, the grass is cut extremely short and even, giving 
            it a carpet-like feel. Once you reach the green, you have to 'putt' 
            the ball, i.e., roll it into the hole with the help of your putter.

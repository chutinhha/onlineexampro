            <br>
            Years ago we discovered the exact point, the dead center of middle

            --Franklin P. Adams<br>
            <br>

            <br>

            --Tommy Bolt<br>
            <br>
            Retire to what? I'm a golfer and a fisherman. I've got no place to 
            retire to. <br>
            --Julius Boros<br>
            <br>
            I regard golf as an expensive way of playing marbles. <br>
            --G. K. Chesterton<br>
            <br>
            How has retirement affected my golf game? A lot more people beat me 
            now. <br>
            --Dwight D. Eisenhower<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            --Billy Graham<br>
            <br>
            Reverse every natural instinct and do the opposite of what you are 
            inclined to do, and you will probably come very close to having a 
            perfect golf swing. <br>
            --Ben Hogan<br>
            <br>
            Go play golf. Go to the golf course. Hit the ball. Find the ball. 
            Repeat until the ball is in the hole. Have fun. The end. <br>
            --Chuck Hogan<br>
            <br>

            --Bob Hope<br>
            <br>
            If you think it's hard to meet new people, try picking up the wrong 
            golf ball. <br>

            play. <br>
            --Joe E. Lewis<br>
            <br>
            They say &quot;practice&quot; makes perfect &quot; Of course, it doesn't. For the 
            vast majority of golfers it merely consolidates imperfection. <br>
            --Henry Longhurst<br>
            <br>

            office of trust under the United States. <br>
            --H. L. Mencken<br>

            --Harvey Penick<br>
            <br>

            --Will Rogers<br>
            <br>
            Income Tax has made more liars out of the American people than Golf.
            <br>
            --Will Rogers<br>
            <br>
            The people who gave us golf and called it a game are the same people 
            who gave us bag pipes and called it music. <br>
            -- TV &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;<br>
            <br>
            I'm a golfaholic. And all the counseling in the world wouldn't help 
            me. <br>
            --Lee Trevino<br>
            <br>
            It's good sportsmanship to not pick up lost golf balls while they 
            are still rolling. <br>
            --Mark Twain<br>
            <br>

            --Woodrow Wilson<br>
            <br>
            Sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth. It 
            is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character. <br>
            --P. G. Wodehouse<br>
            <br>

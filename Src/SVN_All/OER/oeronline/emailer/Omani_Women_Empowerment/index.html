			Empowerment project, which will be hosted by the Art of Living 
			Organization in collaboration with the Matrix Business Academy. The 
			aim of this event would be to empower Young Omani Women who desire 
			to start their own home run business.<br>
			<br>
			The Matrix Business Academy will run a 10 hours workshop over five 
			days, guiding the participants on methods to begin and sustain their 
			business. These participants will then be mentored for three months 
			after the program by the Matrix Academy to start and sustain their 
			business.<br>
			<br>
			Alongside, these handpicked lady entrepreneurs in making, will be 
			taught techniques of breathing, yoga and meditation. This workshop 
			will not only remove stress from the participants, but will also 
			improve their focus, concentration and intuition. These tools and 
			methods imparted during the Art of Living program will help these 
			participants on becoming more dynamic and enthusiastic 
			entrepreneurs.<br>

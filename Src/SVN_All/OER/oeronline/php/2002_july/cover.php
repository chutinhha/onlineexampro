                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In early 2002, Tony Strange, an independent insurance consultant, arrived in Muscat on a secret mission. Strange, a former top executive of the global insurance giant, CGNU, was roped in by the Sultanate’s government to study the business practices of insurance companies and suggest ways to strengthen the industry. After spending about two months in Oman, Strange prepared and submitted a report, which is currently being studied by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI).<br>
                    The report is not official yet, though. All the recommendations of this one-member expert committee are being discussed only in hush-hush tones in the country’s insurance circles. Never mind, the Strange report is not one that will eat dust in the ministry’s shelves, it’s going to be the basis for sweeping changes Omani insurance industry is bracing up for in coming months.&nbsp;<br>
                    Strange’s focus is on restoring customer confidence in the insurance sector that had taken a beating after the collapse of the former national insurance giant Oman National Insurance Company (ONIC) last year. He has also laid thrust on improving the financial health of the companies in order to preserve policyholders’ interests. "This is a very good exercise, since it provides an independent review of operation of insurance companies and the regulatory environment," says P.R. Ramakrishnan, Acting General Manager, Al Ahlia Insurance Company, a prominent national player.&nbsp;<br>
                    A few of Strange’s recommendations include increasing the capital requirement for insurance companies, striking right reinsurance arrangements, observing solvency margins, maintaining claims reserves, adopting proper claim procedures, setting up an association of insurance companies and establishing an insurance training institute in Oman. All these suggestions are likely to be incorporated in the Insurance Companies Law of 1979, the amendment of which is being currently considered by the government.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The capital issue</b><br>
                    One recommendation by Strange that could change the very face of the industry is to increase the capital requirement of an insurance company to RO5 million from the current RO300,000 for national companies and RO600,000 for foreign companies. He found out that most of the local insurance companies had a low premium retention rate, as a big chunk of their risk is normally placed on reinsurances abroad. This meant a large part of the premiums generated within the country were going out of Oman. According to industry estimates, local companies on an average keep only less than 20 per cent of the total premium collected. In essence, most of the national insurance companies were acting more like insurance brokers than as insurers.<br>
                    Out of total premium of RO51.5 million generated in Oman in 2000, national insurance companies had a share of about 78 per cent, while foreign companies mopped up the rest 22 per cent. The government and quasi government businesses remain the largest buyers of insurance in Oman, with most of them going to national companies through tenders. However, after the withdrawal of ONIC, foreign companies have become more active.&nbsp;<br>
                    Strange’s proposal to hike capital requirement is intended to give enough strength to the companies to retain premiums in Oman. "Increasing capital reserves is a good step. It would give birth to stronger players," says Allan G. Nicklin, General Manager, Muscat Insurance Services (MIS), an insurance broking firm doing business in Oman for the past 20 years.<br>
                    Striking a similar note, Trevor DeMonte, General Manager, National Life Insurance Company (NILC), states, "Strange’s suggestions are very perceptive and timely."<br>
                    Dhofar Insurance, Oman’s largest insurance company with a 40 per cent market share - and a local firm too – supports Strange’s idea of increasing capital requirement. "If you have a higher capital, then you can retain more premiums within the country," says Taher T. Al Heraki, Director and General Manager, Dhofar Insurance. Last year, Dhofar Insurance, became the largest company dealing in general insurance after ONIC transferred its local portfolio to the company.&nbsp;<br>
                    Strong players will also make a regulator’s job easier, as they will have the capacity to cover different risks. "It’s always better for a regulator to ensure that companies are financially viable," says Vivek Kolhatkar, Resident Manager, New India Assurance, a foreign general insurer.<br>
                    Financial strength, size, and professional management have become important factors, especially after ONIC’s collapse. According to a leading broker, clients are tending to favour foreign insurance companies even if that means they have to cough up more in terms of premium. R. Vipin Chandra, Country Manager for Oman, Norwich Union Insurance (Gulf) agrees with this view, "Many big clients are looking at stronger insurance companies."<br>
                    “There is a need for greater security in the system. High capitalisation is one way of doing that,” says Mark Sommerville, Manager for Oman, Royal &amp; SunAlliance, the largest foreign insurer in the country.<br>
                    But there are sceptics too. For instance, Oman United Insurance’s Director and Deputy General Manager Sayyid Nassir Bin Salim Al Busaidi believes that increasing capital requirement is a non-issue in the running of the company. "Your underwriting skills are very important," he says. For instance, ONIC’s fall was not because of inadequate capital base, but because of bad underwriting. ONIC apparently had a capital of RO10 million at the time of its collapse.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Size is the key</b><br>
                    If the government is going ahead with the plans to raise the capital limit, what would that mean for small and medium-sized local players who may not be able to raise any capital within the country?<br>
                    "This may result in consolidation of the industry," says Nicklin of MIS. It would either result in multinational insurance companies targeting some of the local companies as joint venture partners or may pave way for mergers among the local insurance companies themselves.<br>
                    Says Sommerville, “Consolida-tion is likely to bring down the total number of players from the current 14 to seven or eight.”&nbsp;<br>
                    One scenario, probably, can be tying up with foreign insurance companies. International firms can now set up their shop in Oman easily since it has joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO). There are already nine foreign companies in Oman operating both in life and general insurance for the last several years. But now foreign companies, which do not have a foothold in Oman, can tie up with local companies that are hungry for capital.<br>
                    Also, national insurance companies may have no other choice than looking for partnerships with foreign firms. "For, it may not be possible for local companies to raise capital from within the country," says a top insurance broker.&nbsp;<br>
                    In that case, who could be the prime targets in Oman for a merger or joint venture? According to seasoned industry watchers, three medium-sized local companies, Al Ahlia Insurance, Oman United Insurance and Muscat Insurance Company could be some of the possible candidates for a takeover or merger.<br>
                    "There has been continuous expression of interest in us. We welcome any strong alliance - foreign or domestic- that would add value to the combined entity and make us a highly visible player in the region," says Al Ahlia’s Ramakrishnan. His company has already experienced acquisitions in the past after it was set up in 1985. In mid-1990s, Zubair Group acquired 43 per cent of Al Ahlia’s equity, and in 2000, ONIC bought over Zubair Group’s stake in the company.<br>
                    The national companies are also looking at each other as potential partners. Industry has a rumour that Al Ahlia and Muscat Insurance Company are holding talks over a possible merger. However, this development could not be confirmed from either party despite repeated attempts by OER.&nbsp;<br>
                    But, one thing is for sure that size is going to be the name of the game. Even a relatively bigger company like Oman United Insurance, which recorded a premium of RO14 million in 2001, is scouting for a partner. "We are looking at merger or partnership possibilities with foreign or domestic companies. Size is the key to survival," says Busaidi. This is despite the fact that Busaidi is not very pleased with the proposal to increase capital requirement.<br>
                    Dhofar Insurance, which has a capital base of RO6 million, may be the only national insurance company which does not need any further fund infusion to meet the proposed capital requirement. The company, in fact, had acquired the entire local business - about 70,000 policies - of the ONIC after the beleaguered company ceased its operations in February 2001. "We would like a situation where there are more number of players in the industry. We are averse to a monopoly situation," says Heraki. Even if Heraki doesn’t need a partner, he will be faced with increased competition since consolidation will give rise to financially stronger insurance players.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Cleaning up</b><br>
                    Strange found out that there is a lot to be desired as far as the management of national insurance companies is concerned. His main concern was about the reinsurance arrangements the companies had struck with international re-insurers. In fact, ONIC’s fall was because of several bad reinsurance deals, industry sources say.<br>
                    So the government may consider making an amendment that all reinsurance companies should be rated at least "AA" or "BBB" by rating agencies like Standard and Poor (S&amp;P), Moody’s or AM Best. For instance, reinsurance companies like Munich Re, Swiss Re and Cologne Re fall in this league. But companies like Dhofar Insurance strongly defends its reinsurance arrangements, claiming most of its reinsurance partners are "AAA" rated. Dhofar has treaty arrangements with 15 re-insurers.<br>
                    Omani companies are also falling behind the foreign companies in maintaining solvency margins. Solvency margin means the companies should have enough liquid assets to cover liabilities. According to a study by MOCI, the local companies earned a net premium of RO16.8 million in 2000, while the net compensation paid was RO26.5 million resulting in a deficiency of RO9.7 million. Compared to this, during the same reference year, foreign companies earned a premium of RO9.3 million, but their compensation paid was just RO7 million, leaving a surplus of more than RO2 million.&nbsp;<br>
                    "This market needs lot more professionalism," says a broker, adding, "Most of the insurance companies were relying on investment profits and not on underwriting ones." In fact, a majority of the national companies were big players in the Muscat Security Market (MSM) until its crash in 1998.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Building institutions</b><br>
                    The government is also considering setting up institutions that would help the insurance industry in Oman grow. Insurance companies in Oman have already suggested the government about forming an association, which would become a common platform for insurers, consumers, regulators and other industry leaders.<br>
                    The association can forge constructive solutions towards industry issues and build a consensus on the needs of the industry and consumer.&nbsp;<br>
                    Establishment of a training institute is another important step that is being considered by the government. For this, insurance institutes from India and Bahrain have already submitted proposals to MOCI. Setting up a training institute can boost the growth of the insurance in Oman. "Locals can sell insurance products better," says DeMonte. Currently, almost all national companies have their own training departments. For instance, NLIC invests about 15 per cent of its total spending on training and development.<br>
                    The government is also contemplating a tribunal for motor accident claims, which may come as a consolation for some insurers, especially the national companies, who think that motor insurance is a loss-making proposition for them. Motor insurance constitute about 60 per cent of the total premium received by both the local and international insurance companies in Oman.&nbsp;<br>
                    As per MOCI, the total vehicle insurance premium received in 2000 was RO31.3 million, while the claims paid on this account amounted to be RO28.4 million. Local companies claim that motor insurance is putting a lot of pressure on them with claims exceeding the premium received.<br>
                    "Motor insurance is a losing business for insurers," says Busaidi of Oman United Insurance, "The cost of servicing motor claims is increasing, while the rise in premium rates does not commensurate with costs." According to Busaidi, accident claims, labour charges for repair, spare part costs, medical bills, besides court orders to pay hefty compensation are hampering the margins of companies.&nbsp;<br>
                    In 2001, according to a Royal Oman Police study, there were 13101 accidents in Oman, of which 402 were fatal and claimed the lives of at least 499 people. The total number of injured people was 9,625. As the frequency and cost of motor claims is a cause for worry, some insurers feel that a motor accident claims tribunal is just what the doctor ordered.&nbsp;<br>
                    But there are also companies making money in motor insurance. "Most of the companies do not underwrite business, they only undercut. We have never lost money on motor insurance in Oman," says Chandra of Norwich Union. For instance, Norwich’s loss on motor portfolio has never crossed more than 60 per cent, Chandra informs.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Way forward</b><br>
                    Insurance companies in Oman – both national as well as foreign – are looking forward to stability in the industry. They feel the changes proposed in the insurance law can go a long way in bringing order within the sector.<br>
                    Besides, legislative reforms, the insurance industry is looking forward to some organic changes within the sector. In fact, a move that could rejuvenate the insurance market in Oman is to make medical insurance compulsory for expatriates especially in the wake of the government order that only serious and emergency cases of expatriates could be treated in government hospitals. "We need some modern insurance products to give a boost to the industry. Medical insurance is an example," says Nicklin.&nbsp;<br>
                    Another booster can come from banks if they deploy their distribution network to sell insurance products. Many insurers are looking at using bank counters for pushing their policies. "We are looking at joint ventures with banks," says Salem Taha, Marketing Manager, American Life Insurance Company, a division of AIG. Even though BankMuscat’s much-awaited acquisition of NLIC is yet to come through, alliance between insurance companies and banks could be driving the future of the industry.&nbsp;</font></p>

                    Once an economic pursuit embedded in the folklore of Oman’s seafaring history, fisheries today is a full-scale industry bustling with commercial activity. New harbours, high-tech processing plants, fish farming projects, quality control programmes, advanced vessel fleets and modern training initiatives, are fast changing the face of the industry. Presently, the fisheries sector is the pivotal thrust area which is expected to generate jobs for the coastal communities in rural areas, boost export revenues and showcase the government’s economic diversification drive.&nbsp;<br>
                    Indeed, besides fisheries, a few other economic sectors outside the realm of oil and gas, have demonstrated a strong potential for robust future growth. But for the moment, the government seems to be all set to boost the morale of its fishing community. Fish production rose by 11 per cent to 120,412 tonne in FY00, up from 108,808 tonne during FY99. More than a third of the total catch, amounting to 46,408 tonne, was exported in FY00, generating export incomes to the tune of around RO37 million. Provisional export data for FY01 and the Q1 of the current year point to a sharp upsurge in exports, fuelled by the start-up of a string of new fish processing plants. The trend will be maintained as a number of planned aqua-farming projects go on-stream.<br>
                    Omani fish, in its fresh, frozen, filleted and processed forms, was exported to a total of 48 countries last year. Roughly 48 per cent of the total volume went to neighbouring United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is the Gulf region’s dominant seafood consumer and hub for fisheries marketing. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and South Korea were the next big importers of Omani fish, accounting for 20 per cent and 4.5 per cent of total exports respectively. Supplies to the European Union (EU), a principal importer of Omani seafood, have since resumed at full throttle after a yearlong hiatus linked to quality concerns. Japan, Taiwan, and of late, the United States have started importing fish from the Sultanate in significant quantities as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Good prospects</b><br>
                    Also, the fisheries sector is all set to witness a significant growth during the current Sixth Five Year Plan (FYP). A growth rate of 4.3 per cent is envisioned during the first four years of the plan, partly driven by the introduction of aquaculture which will contribute around 14,000 tonne to fish production volumes. Returns will also be enhanced by the production of around 100,000 tonne of lantern fish during the plan. Total fish exports are projected to increase annually by about 15.6 per cent in value and eight per cent in quality during this period. The sector’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is set to rise to around two per cent in 2020, from 1.1 per cent in FY93.<br>
                    A major thrust of the Sixth FYP is to develop new marketing avenues capable of maximising returns for farmers, as well as providing for the self-sustainability of the rural population and the improvement of their welfare. This is also sought to be achieved through an effective combination of fishery conservation, management and development programmes.<br>
                    Around 29,000 fishermen are directly involved in fishing activities in the Sultanate, with a further 5,000 employed in secondary occupations. Traditional fishermen operating with the use of small outboard-motor boats roughly bring in 85 per cent of the country’s total catch, and the rest of the lot is involved into commercial fishing.<br>
                    Aquaculture and fish processing ventures are proliferating in the Sultanate, thanks to a burgeoning worldwide appetite for healthful fish, especially from countries with an unspoiled marine environment. An increasing number of fish processing firms are currently cashing in on the growing demand for seafood in the country.<br>
                    Last year, the opening of Dhofar Fisheries Industries Company (DFICO), the country’s largest fish processing and canning facility at Salalah, was a shot in the arm for the sector. With a processing capacity of 22 million tuna cans, 27 million sardine cans, 14,000 tonne of frozen tuna, 1,800 tonne of tuna loins, 1,800 tonne of fishmeal and 250 tonne of fish oil, the project ranks among the largest ventures of its kind in the Middle East.<br>
                    Promoted by Oman and Emirates Investment Holding Company, a joint venture between the governments of Oman and the UAE, the facility has been set up in collaboration with the Spanish undertaking, ACTEMSA, which is a member of one of the largest fisheries corporations in Spain. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait-based investment firms have also taken large stakes in the company, and have invested about US$37 million in the project. A key element of DFICO is its plans to invest in a fleet of modern fishing vessels to provide the bulk of the plant’s tuna needs. The first two vessels, equipped for tuna fishing and processing, were acquired in 2000. These ships are expected to catch around 8,000 tonne of tuna per year - roughly half the licensing quota of 16,000 tonne granted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The remaining quota of pelagic and demersal fish will be procured through DFICO’s participation in a novel ‘Youth Vessel Programme’, which is being implemented in cooperation with the government.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Training the youth</b><br>
                    The Youth Vessel initiative, first mooted by Spain’s ACTEMSA, will offer young Omanis the opportunity to realise fulfilling careers in fishing. For this, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries plans to commission a feasibility study shortly.<br>
                    In essence, the programme aims to offer Omanis a chance to train on board modern fishing vessels fully equipped with cold storage and ice generation facilities, and living quarters as well. This offshore training will be preceded by a phase of onshore academic and practical courses. Ultimately, the government hopes to encourage young nationals to acquire and operate modern fishing vessels of their own, creating additional jobs for their compatriots and contributing towards the growth of fisheries sector.<br>
                    Another heavyweight in the trade is Oman Fisheries Company (OFC), set up as a joint stock company with a government stake of 24 per cent. The company operates four modern plants strategically located at key points along the Sultanate’s coast at Ghala (Muscat), Al Ashkarah, Masirah and Salalah. Established to EU standards, the plants are equipped with blast and plate freezers with a freezing capacity of 100 tonne per day, chill rooms to store raw materials under controlled temperature, flake ice machines, de-skinning machines, steaking bandsaw machines and a fleet of refrigerated vehicles.<br>
                    ISO 9002 certified OFC exports around 12,000 tonne of frozen fish and fish products under the TAQA brand name to more than 30 countries in the EU, Far East, Middle East and the Americas. Its product range includes a wide variety of fish such as kingfish, red sea bream, grouper, emperor, yellow-fin tuna, spotted grunt, croaker, sea cat fish, baby shark, barracuda, blue fish, lizard fish, king soldier bream, and trevally. These varieties can be processed according to buyer specifications - dressed, gilled, gutted, headless, tailless, and so on, as well in the form of fillets and steaks. Exports are generally airfreighted out of Seeb International Airport, which is now served by a large number of cargo carriers operating to various destinations worldwide.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="../../images/2002_july/fish2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="199" height="320">In fact, the Sultanate would like to increase its export earnings and the profitability of its fish-relating manufacturing activities. The biomass of highly sought-after fish and other seafood species within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) offers a great national opportunity in this respect.<br>
                    The British Exclusive Economic Zone Exports Group (BREEZE), a UK-based agency which helps governments create wealth from the oceans and coastal waters, has estimated that Omani companies with an eye on EU and North American markets have the potential to generate RO500 million through exports of processed fish products. If achieved, this would make the country a major player in the global fish trade.<br>
                    BREEZE has voiced the view that the Sultanate’s fish resources may be capable of sustaining a demand for wild marine fish much greater than the needs of its own population. Suitable species for export are large pelagics like tuna and kingfish, demersals like snapper, grouper, pomfret, bass and bream, crustaceans like shrimp, lobster and crab, besides live fish, whole bulk-packaged fish, boneless fillets or loins and vacuum-skin packs of ready-to-eat fish products.&nbsp;</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="../../images/2002_july/fish-process.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="225" height="180">Worldwide the major trading blocs are experiencing a widening deficit of wild fish supply, against a demand which is increasing as consumer dissatisfaction with ‘factory-farmed’ meat grows, says BREEZE. Growing concerns about health and safety, the use of veterinary medications, growth hormones, and contamination with microbial pathogens are also boosting fish consumption. Also, on conscience grounds, people are reducing their consumption of meat, experts of the agency point out.<br>
                    In 1980, the global population’s need for fish in the year 2000 was projected to be in excess of 110 million tonne, but supply has averaged at around 90 million tonne since the late 1980s. Japan has been the biggest buyer of fish products, importing US$8.3 billion worth of seafood, followed by the US (US$5.6 billion), and France (US$2.02 billion). The top EU, North American and Japanese multiple retailers (supermarket chains) and fast food multiples are the main customers and not individual fish merchants.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Overhauling fish processing</b><br>
                    In the Sultanate, some 20 fish processing companies have so far won approval to market Omani fish products to quality-conscious Japan, the European Union (EU) and the North American markets. Quality control and hygiene are the all-important buzzwords, which all fish exporters must swear by if they wish to enjoy unfettered market access to Europe and Japan in particular.<br>
                    Jolted by a fish export ban by the EU in 1998, the government scrambled to overhaul the vital fish processing sector and strengthen the industry-wide compliance with EU and international quality control standards. New laws were put in place requiring exporters to implement stringent HACCP quality control criteria at their facilities as a precondition for export, especially to the key European and Japanese markets. A licence to export to these markets was made contingent on implementation of the tough Omani Fishing Regulation.<br>
                    Simultaneously, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries began work on a comprehensive quality control management regime espousing a uniform quality system encompassing the entire fishery process from fish production to marketing. As part of this effort, it created a provisional quality control section within the Marine Science and Fisheries Centre (MSFC). But the capacity of the MSFC, which is primarily a research facility, to handle the increasing number of tests and inspections of fish processing plants mandated under the Omani Fishery Regulations, became moot.<br>
                    The establishment of a quality control institute for fisheries products, equipped with adequate testing and analysis equipment to meet international quality control and hygiene standards, became an urgent issue. Towards this end, the government with the Japanese government’s assistance began to work on a project to construct and provide equipment for a Quality Control Centre for Fishery Products (FQCC) capable of testing, analysis, guidance, educational, and training activities.<br>
                    In April this year, the new FQCC came into being at Al Bustan in Muscat - the result of a multi-million dollar investment. Set on a 3,500 square metre plot, the two-storey facility is equipped with a full range of laboratories. Its mandate is to inspect Omani fish products, conduct lab tests and analyses, and most importantly, certify Omani fish processing firms as HACCP compliant. On a wider level, its mission is to affirm trust in Omani fishery products by promoting and satisfying international quality control and hygiene standards.<br>
                    Keen to boost high quality fish exports, the FQCC has also commissioned a study to pinpoint deficiencies, if any, elsewhere along the fisheries chain. The three-year long initiative will look at factors that may contribute to fish quality deterioration along the length of the chain - from the point of catch to delivery to processing companies.<br>
                    A number of major processing firms are participating in the study. Fish is sampled at landing points along the Sultanate’s coast, as well as from catches bought directly from traditional fishermen. Samples are also being tested for any chemical and microbiological contaminants, including heavy metals and parasites. The results are expected to help in the development of a database that would allow the EU and other potential markets to obtain a clear picture of the quality of Omani fish exports.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Research and modification</b><br>
                    In fact, a strong emphasis on scientific research and modernisation is forcing an industry-wide rethink on obsolete fishing practices and helping refocus attention on the specific potentials of Oman’s considerable fishery wealth. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, along with its fishery research stations at Muscat and Salalah, and Sultan Qaboos University have been working together on a plethora of research projects of potentially far-reaching significance for the industry. These initiatives cover a gamut of issues including farming of fin fish, shrimp and abalone, among other aspects of aquaculture and mariculture.<br>
                    One such study undertaken recently by the Marine Science and Fisheries Centre (MSFC) has highlighted the need to conserve Sultanate’s commercial valuable demersal fish stocks. Grouper, mullet, croaker, sea bream, cuttlefish, emperor and ribbon fish are some examples of commercially important demersal species which are at the heart of the Sultanate’s commercial and traditional-based fisheries sectors. Demersal fish catches, which account for roughly a third of the Sultanate’s total fish production, are the mainstay of the country’s trawler-based fishing between Masirah and the Hallaniyat islands.<br>
                    In recent years, overexploitation of demersal fish species has led to an alarming decline in stocks, forcing the government to announce a temporary moratorium on demersal fishing in 1998. A four-month ‘closed season’ went into force from July-November that year to allow demersal fish species to spawn and recruit. Fishing has since resumed but is being closely monitored by researchers.<br>
                    A key goal of the MSFC study is to estimate stocks of important demersal species thriving in the Sultanate’s waters, and to determine scientific methods of managing them. The project also weighs the impact of fishing methods involving long lines, gill nets and so on, and will recommend new fishing guidelines on net mesh size and harvest periods to help stocks recoup.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Aquaculture</b><br>
                    A number of aquaculture study initiatives have also translated into full-blown commercial ventures. Notable is the example of Oman International Shrimp Company (OISC), which has set up the country’s first fully integrated aquaculture farm at Al Duqm in the Al Wusta region. Billed as the biggest of its kind in the Gulf region, the Shanfari Group enterprise has the potential to spearhead Oman’s entry into the global multi-billion dollar commerce shrimp farming industry.<br>
                    OISC was established in the year 2000 in partnership with Sea Farms International, one of the world’s leading shrimp aquaculture specialists. The successful harvest of saltwater Black Tiger prawns at the company’s pilot farm at Duqm - the second such harvest this year - has proved the viability of breeding and farming this seafood delicacy for the insatiable markets of mainly Europe and the US. The company will soon start commercial development of the project. It also plans to invest in a full-fledged hatchery in Barka to supply juveniles for the Duqm farm.&nbsp;<br>
                    Shrimp harvesting is a key economic activity on the Al Wusta coast, but is limited to the September-March season. Total shrimp production during 2000 rose by 21.5 per cent to 432 tonne, valued at RO2 million. The Wusta region accounted for 99 per cent of this catch.<br>
                    Among other commercial initiatives pursued by the private sector, a Dubai-based public joint stock company, Asmak International Fish Farming, has tied up with a local Omani company to establish a joint venture fish farming project at Quriyat in Muscat Governorate. A joint venture fish processing facility is also planned by the same group at Rusayl.<br>
                    Keen to develop the fishery sector, the government is pressing ahead with its infrastructure development programme. Four new fish harbour projects are under development or planned in the current FFP, at Al Ashkara on the Sharqiya coast, and Sohar, Saham and Liwa on the Batinah coast. Additional jetties have been planned elsewhere on the Sultanate’s coast, and this is presently the subject of a major consultancy study initiated by the Ministry.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Harbour development</b><br>
                    An estimated RO18 million has been invested into fishery harbour projects in recent years. Fishing harbours are already in operation at Bukha in the Governorate of Musandam, Shinas and Al Khaburah on the Batinah coast, Muttrah and Quriyat in the Governorate of Muscat, Sur and Masirah in the Sharqiya region, Al Jazer in the Wusta region, and Raysut, Dhalkut and Mirbat in the Governorate of Dhofar.<br>
                    By establishing the basic infrastructure like harbours, the government is also paving way for the private sector to invest in associated services such as processing facilities, ice plants, boat and engine repair and maintenance workshops, and marketing outlets for fishing and related gear.&nbsp;<br>
                    In order to attract Omanis to the fishery sector, the government is also setting up two Fishery Training Institutes - one in Al Khaburah and the other in Salalah. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and an Egypt-based training academy will be involved in the establishment and operation of the campuses - billed as the first of their kind in the Gulf.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Curbing over-fishing</b><br>
                    A number of regulations are in force to curb over-fishing and discourage improper fishing methods. Lobster, shrimp and abalone - all high-value items, but highly vulnerable to over-exploitation - can only be fished during specific seasons of the year. Other measures regulate the size of nets and equipment used for fishing, as well as defines the areas, depths, quantities and kinds of fish that may be targeted for commercial fishing. Inspectors work in cooperation with the Royal Oman Police Coast Guard service and other security agencies to keep a close tab on commercial fishing vessels and possible poachers.<br>
                    Within the region, the Sultanate is working with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the FAO to forge a common strategy for conserving food stocks against over-fishing and regulating fishing activities. It is a leading member of the Regional Authority for Fishing Zones, which has been set up to establish effective control, assess resources and introduce sound management of the fishery wealth of littoral states.<br>
                    Oman is also active in the transnational cooperation in fisheries management under the auspices of Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOARC). Thus, the government’s initiatives to raise the fisheries sector to a really big time activity is most likely to pay rich dividend given the nation’s rich marine wealth.&nbsp;</font></p>

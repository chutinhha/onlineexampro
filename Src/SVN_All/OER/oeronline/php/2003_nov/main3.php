            <img border="0" src="wipro-Vaswani.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="185" height="189">Oman is coming of age as far as IT is concerned. With the recent 
            opening up of Knowledge Oasis Muscat, Oman's technology park, and 
            with Omantel all geared up to enter the privatisation phase, it 
            isn't too far when big foreign IT companies, alone or in association 
            with local ones, will make Oman the hub for providing the best IT 
            services to customers in the Sultanate as well the region and 
            throughout the world.<br>
            The recent to the Sultanate of Oman visit of Suresh Vaswani, 
            president of Wipro Infotech, the Indian and Asia Pacific IT division 
            of the $902-million (RO347 million) Wipro Limited, was a step in 
            this direction. Wipro Infotech, which is among the Top 10 IT Service 
            and Solutions providers in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East, 
            also provides IT consulting services in the region besides catering 
            to enterprise customers' needs for high value IT products, services, 
            solutions and IT consulting services in India, its home base. <br>
            With a strong presence in nearly all the major continents of the 
            world, the company is now particularly focusing on the Middle East. 
            Although the company is relatively new to this region, it has fared 
            well. In the Middle East, Wipro Infotech stared its operations in 
            early 2001, and it is to its credit that, in such a short span of 
            time, the company has established a strong customer base across the 
            region. Wipro Middle East has secured over 50 IT services and 
            software projects in its two years of operations in the region, 
            including Dubai e-government, Dubai Dry Docks, Dubai Municipality, 
            Saudi Polyolefins, Riyadh Pharma and Doha Bank. <br>
            Now eyeing the Omani market, the company is trying to establish its 
            presence here, with the company announcing its partnership with 
            International Information Technology Co. (IITC), a Muscat-based IT 
            solutions company as well as its work with Petroleum Development 
            Oman (PDO) to provide a Capability Maturity Model (CMM) consultancy 
            services. It encompasses orientation towards CMM and process 
            improvement on application development, testing and support. <br>
            Vaswani met government and industry leaders to brief them of his 
            company's business plans for the country besides announcing the 
            tie-up with IITC, which also has partnerships with Cisco, Marconi, 
            3Com, Foundry Networks, Avaya, Sitara and Alcatel Networks for 
            networking and enterprise solutions. <br>
            The 20-year old IITC is expected to leverage Wipro's experience in 
            infrastructure management, technology integration services, 
            enterprise application development and IT consulting services. <br>
            Vaswani sees Oman as a developing IT market with good opportunities 
            for his company to do business. He revealed some of his company's 
            business plans for the Sultanate in an exclusive interview with OER. 
            Excerpts: <br>
            <br>
            <b>What brings you to Muscat? </b><br>
            Business brings us here. We have come here to understand the Omani 
            market and invest money. We are aware that the government here is 
            very much interested in what we call e-governance, and they want 
            quality players to fulfil their dream of e-governance. Wipro 
            Infotech is a seasoned player in the field of IT and we can help the 
            Omani government in this area. We have come here for business 
            development. We have met senior officials in the government and key 
            industry players in this regard. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What do you think of the Middle East market and how important is 
            it to you? </b><br>
            The Middle East is a very important market to us. We have a strong 
            position in the UAE. We have been in Dubai for a year-and-a-half 
            now, and our regional headquarters are there. We are established 
            players in the UAE and the Saudi market. Wipro has won over 50 
            high-end IT services and software projects in the Middle East in 
            just over 2 years of setting up operations in the region. We are now 
            trying to expand in Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. We are taking a 
            step-by-step approach. <br>
            <br>
            <b>How important is Oman to Wipro's overall expansion strategy? </b>
            <br>
            Oman is a critical market for our global expansion strategy. We see 
            it as a rapidly growing IT services market and are committed to 
            building a strong business base in the Sultanate. It is extremely 
            important to our business. Oman is a developing market as far as IT 
            concerned. We have the expertise and experience since we have 
            expanded all over the world. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What are Wipro's plans for this region? </b><br>
            We want to invest in this market. We can help provide good IT 
            services in the country. We have good experience, robust quality 
            processes, in-depth understanding of various domains and our 
            comprehensive range of high-value IT services can be of great help 
            to the customers and business alike. Our work in the Middle East is 
            all about high-end integration. This also applies to Oman. We will 
            be involved in all high-end work here. We will offer technology 
            services, business solutions and business intelligence and data 
            warehousing and consulting services. We also want to invest in the 
            telecom sector as we have a strong presence in this market globally. 
            In fact, more that 35 per cent of our revenue comes from the telecom 
            sector. In this regard, I met the head of Omantel to brief him about 
            my company and its plans for the telecom sector in Oman. We hope to 
            do a lot in this sector and the opportunities will be immense once 
            the sector is opened to private players. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Is this Wipro's first venture in Oman? <br>
            </b>We do not have any financial tie-up in the literal term, but we 
            work with OHI's IITC. For the past eight months, it has been our 
            local representative to address the IT needs of customers in Oman. 
            It is through them that we operate in the Omani market. We use their 
            marketing network to do business in the county. Hopefully, very 
            soon, you'll see our physical presence here. PDO is our second 
            partner here. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Wipro is a strong IT player. But the recent global slump has 
            dampened the spirits of the IT industry. How did Wipro fare during 
            these bad times? </b><br>
            Business is all about loss and profit. Some years back, we saw a 
            strong boom in the market, but unfortunately, a depressed phase 
            followed it. Global trends certainly have an impact on any company, 
            but India's success in the global software market has been 
            praiseworthy. When the economy took a downturn, we learnt what is 
            called cost-cutting. Wipro weathered the bad phase because we were 
            able to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency in spite of 
            depressed market conditions. We are committed to quality and 
            cost-effective solutions. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Recently, Indian IT companies have been increasingly targeting 
            the Middle East market. Is this a way to offset the losses in the US 
            market? </b><br>
            Certainly, the US has been India's top software export destination. 
            However, this does not mean that the company should not focus 
            elsewhere. Wipro did make fortunes in markets like the US, Europe 
            and India. We matured there, but we hope to grow further in the 
            Mideast. As I mentioned previously, we are not completely new to 
            this region. Our headquarters are in Dubai. We are doing very well 
            there and are expanding in other countries of this region. Lately, 
            the governments of these countries are encouraging investment in IT 
            and this is exactly what we are doing. It is a progressing and 
            developing market and we wish to be a key player in the field.</font><hr color="#CC3333">

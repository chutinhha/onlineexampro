            oil market have worked</b><br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="oil.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="159" height="149">OPEC's shock oil cut of late September appears to have done the 
            trick. Oil prices have been above $30 per barrel almost ever since 
            the cartel cut output in late September. And UAE Oil Minister Obaid 
            bin Saif al-Nasseri has warned that a U-turn is unlikely in the 
            foreseeable future - in late October, he said world oil markets 
            would be more than adequately supplied through the first quarter of 
            2004, and warned that stockpiles are building. <br>
            &quot;The powers of supply and demand indicate that there are adequate 
            oil supplies in the last quarter of this year and the first quarter 
            of next year, which will lead to a buildup in global oil stockpiles 
            during this period of high demand. Crude oil stockpiles in the main 
            consuming countries are increasing and are now higher than last 
            year,&quot; he told a fuel bunkering conference in the UAE's emirate of 
            Fujairah. <br>
            The current price spike dates back to the unexpected events of late 
            September. On Tuesday, September 23, it seemed that OPEC was poised 
            to keep its production quotas unchanged. OPEC oil ministers were 
            gathering in Vienna for one of their regular meetings to discuss the 
            cartel's closely watched quotas, and high profile figures were 
            stressing the need to a period of stability. <br>
            &quot;We have to study the situation and take the necessary step,&quot; said 
            Obeid bin Saif Al Nasiri, UAE Minister of Petroleum and Mineral 
            Resources, upon his arrival in Vienna. &quot;There is no big reason or 
            strong reasons for change.&quot; <br>
            The UAE was not the only major producer pledging to weather a 
            downturn in crude prices by keeping output limits unchanged for the 
            rest of the year: Al Nasiri's message was echoed by his Kuwaiti 
            counterpart, Sheikh Ahmad Fahd Al Ahmad Al Sabah. &quot;We are very 
            worried about the prices, especially these days, with prices not 
            very good,&quot; he told reporters on the eve of the meeting. &quot;But I 
            think we have to continue with the same production we have now and 
            continue to watch the market. If it is necessary to act, we have to 
            act as soon as prices are above or below the target range.&quot; Sheikh 
            Ahmad said he thought a meeting in December would be a &quot;good 
            choice.&quot; <br>
            What a difference a day makes. Little more than 24 hours after 
            Kuwait and the UAE - heavyweight producers within the OPEC hierarchy 
            - had been pledging to keep quotas unchanged, the cartel slashed output 
            by some 4 per cent, to 24.5 million barrels per day (b/d). Prices 
            had fallen throughout September to below $25 per barrel (/b), OPEC's 
            target price for oil. Producers felt they had to act to arrest the 
            decline before it gathered too much momentum <br>
            &quot;Having reviewed the current oil market, the [OPEC] Conference noted 
            that, whilst the global economy appears to be improving, only 
            normal, seasonal growth in demand is expected for the fourth 
            quarter, and the market continues to be well-supplied,&quot; said an OPEC 
            communiqué after the meeting on September 24. <br>
            &quot;In view of the continued rise in non-OPEC supplies and the ongoing 
            recovery in Iraqi production, stocks have been replenished and are 
            rapidly reaching normal seasonal levels, with the supply/demand 
            balance for the fourth quarter 2003 and first quarter 2004 
            indicating a contra-seasonal stock build-up. This could have a 
            destabilising effect on the market which requires a reduction of 
            supplies from all producers to ensure stability.&quot; The forecast 
            gradual return of Iraqi crude to the market was a further factor 
            weighing on OPEC's mind. <br>
            The move shocked oil traders, who had been banking on a 'no change' 
            policy. On London's International Petroleum Exchange, November Brent 
            jumped more than 4 per cent, to $26.85/b. Many dealers lost money on 
            the unexpected price swing. &quot;The hedge funds are short and they will 
            be running for cover,&quot; said Gary Ross of New York consultancy PIRA 
            Energy - a reference to the fact that many hedge fund managers had 
            bet on prices falling further. <br>
            The International Energy Agency (IEA) reacted with predictable 
            disdain. As the West's energy watchdog, the IAE reacts badly to any 
            move that threatens to inflate prices and, by extension, threaten 
            economic growth in the industrialised world. &quot;Given the continued 
            weakness of the world economy, OPEC's strategy to maintain prices at 
            persistently high levels cannot contribute to a sustained recovery 
            and a return to global economic growth,&quot; said Claude Mandil, head of 
            the Paris-based agency. <br>
            Are Mandil's fears justified? Maybe. &quot;I don't think it's a major 
            negative given the improving economic outlook, but on the margin, 
            when you have higher oil prices, it could crimp consumer spending,&quot; 
            said Rich Nash, chief market strategist at Victory Capital 
            Management in Cleveland, US. <br>
            In truth, OPEC is unlikely to do anything that risks upsetting the 
            global economic recovery. OPEC ministers understand well the 
            economics of the oil market - they know that global economic 
            slowdown translates into weak oil demand, lower production and lower 
            prices. Their move in late September was more defensive than 
            offensive, and if prices threaten to breach $30/b, OPEC will likely 
            turn the taps back on to cool the market.<br>
            &quot;Taking into consideration the market outlook for 2004, with its 
            concomitant uncertainties, the Conference further decided to convene 
            an Extraordinary Meeting in Vienna on December 4, 2003, to review 
            market developments and take whatever measures it deems appropriate 
            at that time,&quot; said OPEC in its communiqué. The days when the West 
            could not trust OPEC to deliver on such promises are gone - despite 
            the smoke and mirrors that characterised the surprise decision in 
            Vienna late last month. OPEC showed itself to be a responsible 
            global citizen when it hiked production in early 2003 when the 
            US-led war in Iraq halted Iraq production. Expect a similar reaction 
            if anything threatens to send prices soaring in the coming months - 
            despite the hawkish words from Al Naseri. The author is Director,

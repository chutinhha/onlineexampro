                    <img border="0" src="profile.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="190">Dr 
                    Abdulla Lamki, deputy managing director, Petroleum 
                    Development Oman (PDO), has been lured away from the 
                    prospect of a deserved retirement. As the oil behemoth 
                    strives to discover and recover more oil, it's good to 
                    retain professionals that can provide stable leadership and 
                    unwavering support to the company's management. As it 
                    happens, Abdulla's friends and family are also very 
                    fortunate to keep him because ten years ago his life was 
                    nearly taken away. <br>
                    The experience deeply unnerved him. Abdullah reveals that 
                    the biggest challenge of his life was managing the crisis of 
                    confidence he had upon suffering a brain haemorrhage in 
                    1993, a few weeks before he turned 50. &quot;Initially, the pain 
                    felt like a bomb exploding in head. I can really empathise 
                    with those who have suffered a trauma,&quot; he says in an 
                    exclusive interview with OER. <br>
                    Following medical treatment in the UK, Abdulla returned to 
                    Oman but he found to his complete dismay that his 
                    decision-making processes had significantly slowed down. &quot;I 
                    was not myself for over 3 months. As you can imagine, I 
                    became disorientated and it was a real challenge to regain 
                    my confidence,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I was determined to pick myself 
                    up. I remember going to an industry conference in Jakarta. 
                    It was a tough decision to go but I did not falter. I had to 
                    push myself to do it and to regain the self-belief that I 
                    had lost.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Digging deep to succeed </b><br>
                    Abdulla certainly has not been a stranger to meeting 
                    challenges. Since 1970, enormous changes and extreme tests 
                    have engulfed the local oil and gas industry in the wake of 
                    rapid expansion and development. Very early on during his 
                    career at PDO, he started to challenge many of the 
                    unquestioned assumptions related to the company's procedures 
                    and has thereby forced fundamental progress. <br>
                    Abdulla explains that the biggest turning point in his life 
                    came when he was teaching Physics for two years at the 
                    University of Baghdad, saying, &quot;I had an option to continue 
                    to teach in Iraq but I decided to return to Oman in 1973. I 
                    did not have it in my mind to become an oilman but I joined 
                    the oil industry here and I have never looked back since.&quot;<br>
                    During Abdulla's 30-year tenure at PDO, the company has 
                    soared to become the second largest employer of Omani 
                    nationals (after the government) in the country. It employed 
                    3,470 Omani employees at the end of 2001 (an Omanisation 
                    level of around 82 per cent) and it relied on a contractor 
                    workforce of over 10,000 employees. Moreover, as a boost to 
                    local businesses, PDO purchases over US$200 million of 
                    services and materials from local suppliers and contractors 
                    alone. <br>
                    Even his harshest critics would admit that Abdulla's 
                    management has had crucial and indispensable human 
                    dimensions. He devotes a time to getting to know his 
                    associates - not only the chief executives but also less 
                    highly placed individuals from all spheres of the company 
                    activities. A tireless worker and a devout family man, 
                    Abdulla is constantly in touch with reality and a person who 
                    promotes a strong work ethic. He reflects that his mother, 
                    who had no formal education, was an extremely wise woman 
                    whose advice has helped him build a successful career. &quot;One 
                    of the most memorable sayings my mother taught me was that 
                    people must earn rewards, no one is entitled to them.&quot;<br>
                    &quot;I cannot understand why some young people find it difficult 
                    to motivate themselves in the workplace. I never used to ask 
                    my boss to motivate me. If my job was not challenging 
                    enough, I would ensure that I moved beyond the boundaries of 
                    the position to extend myself and become self-motivated. I 
                    have difficulty with the complacent nature of some 
                    youngsters (a worrying trend locally as well as globally) 
                    who cannot achieve such inspiration,&quot; he adds. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Life's journey </b><br>
                    A 'lucky' number 13 from a family of 20 children, Abdulla 
                    was born in Zanzibar. He has fond memories of a happy 
                    childhood. Both of his parents made sure that schooling and 
                    further education was central to the upbringing of their 
                    children, most of whom subsequently went on to obtain 
                    university degrees. From the 20 children, five became 
                    doctors, two economists, one a lawyer, one a teacher, one a 
                    chemist, one a pharmacist, one a nurse and then, of course, 
                    there is Abdulla, the nuclear physicist who turned into a 
                    petroleum engineer. <br>
                    Abdulla's family moved to Egypt in 1965 and then to Oman in 
                    1971. During this time, Abdulla admits he was fortunate to 
                    have been at Trinity College in Dublin where he successfully 
                    gained a doctorate in Physics several years later. <br>
                    &quot;Probably the proudest moment in my life was when I had been 
                    elected a Foundation Scholar at Trinity College in Dublin,&quot; 
                    he reflected. &quot;I was 20 years old at the time but I remember 
                    distinctly the moment when my name was called out in front 
                    of the town's square to announce my election. Over 200 
                    students had tried to clinch it.&quot; <br>
                    During term time, Abdulla recalls working as a demonstrator 
                    in the Physics laboratory of Trinity giving private tuition 
                    for basic sciences to first-year Medical students. During 
                    the holidays, he worked in factories, offices and even a 
                    launderette to raise funds to continue studying. <br>
                    &quot;The Irish were absolutely wonderful to me. I was in Dublin 
                    from 1962 to 1970, when Ireland was a relatively poor 
                    country, particularly the west of Ireland, but the Irish 
                    people welcomed me into their homes with open arms and 
                    during the nine Christmases I spent there I never once ate 
                    alone,&quot; he says. <br>
                    With a PhD in hand, Abdulla moved outside Dublin to 
                    establish a science department at a regional technical 
                    institute. He then took a lecture post at the University of 
                    Baghdad teaching Physics and Electronics. Two years later, 
                    in 1973, he moved to Muscat to join his parents and started 
                    work with PDO. Thirty years on, Abdulla is a reluctant hero. 
                    He keeps a low public profile and rarely goes on the record 
                    to talk about his achievements. OER is glad that it stole a 
                    few minutes with the star nuclear physics student who has 
                    become a leading light in Oman's oil business.</font></p>

            OER about your career...</b><br>
            After finishing schooling in Salalah (where I was born in 1959), I 
            studied a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering in 
            Northrop University, Los Angeles. Following my graduation in 1986, I 
            joined Sultan Qaboos Port as Manager of Projects and Planning. 
            During my five years at the company, I successfully completed a 
            Master of Science degree in Maritime Affairs from the World Maritime 
            University, Malmš, Sweden. This postgraduate programme gave me 
            plenty of expertise in marketing as well as the management of Port 
            logistics and general administration. I joined the Ministry of Oil &amp; 
            Gas (then known as the Ministry of Oil and Minerals) in 1992 as 
            Advisor. In 1995, I moved to Oman Refinery Company working in the 
            marketing division - which in 2000 became established as Al Maha 
            Petroleum Products Marketing LLC. Today, it has grown to become one 
            of Oman's leading petroleum marketing companies with more than 95 
            fuel service stations and over 89 staff.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What does the future hold for Al Maha with the emergence of 
            Omanoil? </b><br>
            There is no adverse impact to our company from the launch of the 
            Omanoil brand. One should not forget that despite BP Plc's departure 
            from the Omani fuel retail market, there are still three players in 
            the market. The key differentiator between each of these continues 
            to be the level of service that they offer to customers. I am very 
            proud to say that we offer the best there is and that Al Maha is 
            fully led by a young Omani management.<br>
            Al Maha has already developed its own IT systems: A unique forecourt 
            automation system and a smart card payments solution. Also, our 
            company will successfully proceed with its expansion programme. We 
            will upgrade our services and make more services available at our 
            sites such as car washes and lube services. Moreover, one 'smart' 
            payment solution will be available for all of these services soon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What level of service do customers generally receive in Oman? </b>
            <br>
            It varies from place to place. Sometimes, it is very poor, but more 
            often than not, it is fairly good. It is a fact that many sales 
            representatives in the country lack proper training. Some employees 
            in Oman have problems in basic communication and, unintentionally, 
            appear to be inconsiderate. <br>
            My advice to their managers is to educate, train and advise them 
            correctly to ensure they follow the rule: The customer is always 
            right. They should always be reminded to deal with customers and 
            follow the same standards regardless of who they are or whom they 
            are serving. Such actions would attract more custom and could 
            stimulate business success.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What has been the most unacceptable situation that you have 
            experienced while at work?</b><br>
            To have taken advice from a so-called expert and then to discover 
            that the person you had confided in has been totally dishonest with 
            you and is not an expert at all. <br>
            <br>
            <b>If you were not working with Al Maha, what do you think you would 
            be doing? </b><br>
            I think I would add value as a lecturer in a university. Because of 
            my academic background and the experience I have gained in industry, 
            I feel I could share this valuable knowledge with others. <br>
            <br>
            <b>You go into a shop at a petrol station, what do you shop for? <br>
            </b>Like other customers, I tend to shop for urgent products that 
            are missing in my household. Obviously, I do not buy food or 
            non-food items which my family consume on a regular basis. As OER 
            reported last month, there are plenty of hypermarkets and 
            superstores in Oman for weekly shopping trips! <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which car do you drive?</b><br>
            I own an Audi A8. I think it's the best car in the luxury saloon 
            range. It scores very well when it comes to steering and 
            manoeuvrability as well as comfort and safety. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What more would you want from a car? </b><br>
            To be frank, I would not swap my Audi for any other car. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What is your favourite mode of transport? </b><br>
            Although I enjoy driving in my car, I would say flying by plane is 
            my favourite mode of transport. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Have you ever been involved in a serious motoring accident?</b><br>
            I was once involved in a serious car accident. The crash happened in 
            the capital area in 1993. A car that was being driven at speed and 
            in a reckless manner hit my car (a BMW520 at the time) from behind. 
            Fortunately, I was alone and unhurt. The other driver was also alone 
            and escaped injuries. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What is the smartest office gadget that you own? </b><br>
            My Qtek pocket PC and telephone is a clever office gadget. But I 
            should like to add that I could live without it.<br>
            <br>
            <b>You need to entertain some VIPs. Which local restaurant do you 
            take them to? </b><br>
            There is no particular restaurant I would take them to in Muscat. 
            Firstly, I would find out which cuisine they prefer to eat. 
            Secondly, I would find out if they have a particular preference as 
            to where they would like to eat. If they had no preferences, of 
            course, I would make sure they would dine at one of Oman's finest 
            hotels or restaurants. Personally speaking, I rarely dine out. I 
            much prefer home cooking.</font></p>

                into what is currently the automotive world’s fastest-growing 
                segment. The Volvo XC60 is equally at home everywhere, whether 
                on road in an urbane location or off road in a trip communing 
                with nature. The cutting edge safety and Scandinavian design 
                help you make the best of all terrains- from here to what’s 
                beyond. The big safety news is City Safety – a unique feature 
                that can help the driver reduce the effects of the type of 
                low-speed impacts that are common in city traffic and traffic 
                tailbacks. If the car is about to drive into the vehicle in 
                front and the driver does not react, the car brakes itself. The 
                new XC60 will initially be available with the six-cylinder 
                turbocharged T6 engine producing 285 horsepower. The highly 
                efficient 3.0 litre six- cylinder petrol engine is linked to an 
                intelligent all-wheel drive system that continuously ensures 
                power goes to the wheels with the best traction.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

                    over 5m long and 2m wide, it is also the biggest in its 
                    class. Inside, the vehicle offers class-topping comfort with 
                    three rows of seats. The 3rd-row is a 60:40 split bench seat 
                    that enables even a 190cm tall person to sit in comfort. It 
                    even offers a cushion-interlocked, power reclining function. 
                    At the same time passengers can experience the luxury of the 
                    3-zone automatic climate control system, for individual 
                    adjustment of temperature. There is ample power on tap in

                    For 2009, European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) 
                    has implemented a more stringent evaluation system that 
                    awards a single overall vehicle safety rating combining the 
                    scores achieved in four areas of assessment: Adult Occupant 
                    Protection, Child Protection, Pedestrian Protection and 
                    Safety Assist. The Mazda6 was in the first group of vehicles 
                    tested under the new framework. Despite this the new Mazda6 
                    has been awarded the five-star maximum rating by the Euro 
                    NCAP in its 2009 combined safety performance test. This

                    provide an extraordinary opportunity to experience the full

                    spring 2009 onwards, participants’ driving skills are 
                    improved alongside a professional driver instructor, while 
                    exploring the full potential of the Lamborghini Gallardo LP

                    old and there are currently no plans to bring production to 
                    an end. The Stuttgart-based car maker first unveiled this 
                    robust off-roader to the public in 1979 and has delivered a 
                    total of some 200,000 units of the G-Class to customers 
                    around the world. This model family, which is acknowledged 
                    to be the best in the off-road sector, bears the succinct 
                    “G” prefix in addition to the Mercedes star. The vehicle has 
                    won the Paris-Dakar Rally, become an automotive styling 
                    icon, continues to emerge victorious in reader votes and 
                    represents the gene pool for the Mercedes-Benz SUV family, 
                    which has meanwhile grown to five model series. And that’s 
                    not all. With a production life of 30 years, the ‘G’ is 
                    easily the longest-serving passenger car series in the more 
                    than 120-year history of Mercedes-Benz. Continuous model 
                    updates have kept G-Class up to the latest technological 
                    development status and guarantee a superior drive system,

                    the 16th of February at their showroom in Whattayah. The 
                    Audi RS6 is the high-performance athlete of the A6 family. 
                    With fascinating performance and breathtaking dynamics, it 
                    is in a league of its own – as the world’s most powerful 
                    series-produced sedan. The superior V10 engine with direct 
                    injection and twin turbochargers eclipses its competitors 
                    with an output of 580hp and 650Nm of torque. And at the same 
                    time, the new RS6 offers all the comfort of the large 
                    executive model series from Audi. The Audi RS6 has 
                    performances figures worthy of the supercar segment. It 
                    sprints from a standstill to 100km/h in 4.5 seconds and 
                    takes 14.5 seconds to reach 200km/h. The electronic limiter 
                    ends the acceleration once a speed of 250km/h has been 
                    reached. The twin turbochargers ensure an extremely 
                    powerful, homogenous power build-up across almost the entire 
                    rpm range. The maximum torque of 650Nm is available on a 
                    broad and high plateau of 1,500 to 6,250rpm. <br>

            <img border="0" src="peri.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="125" height="148">The Australian dollar lost more than a fifth of its value in 2008 
            because commodities prices plunged and the Japanese yen finance 
            carry trade was unwound as the Reserve Bank slashed the benchmark 
            Aussie money market rate from 7 per cent to 3.25 per cent. The 
            Australian dollar is vulnerable to falls in the price of iron ore, 
            coal, gas, gold and platinum as commodities account for an 
            incredible 60 per cent of total exports. Moreover, the Aussie/Yen 
            cross trade is a classic metric of risk aversion, as Japanese 
            capital flows to high yield money market instruments freeze when 
            currency risk rises. However, the Australian dollar has largely 
            priced in the RBA interest rate cuts and the end of irrational 
            exuberance in the commodities market.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Currency woes </b><br>
            I doubt if the Japanese yen, which has risen since 120 at the outset 
            of the currency crises, to 90 now, can rise much more than 87-88. 
            After all, the Bank of Japan has signalled that it could well 
            intervene to restrain further yen appreciation because Japan’s 
            economy contracted at a traumatic 14 per cent in 4Q2008, its exports 
            colossi such as Sony, Toyota, Hitachi and Toshiba face the first 
            operating losses in decades and the LDG, with an unpopular Prime 
            Minister Taro Aso, does not want to face the electorate amid a 
            recession. Another embryonic but positive trend for the Aussie 
            dollar is the rapid expansion in the Chinese money supply and 
            Beijing’s $580bn fiscal stimulus. This trend could well put a bid on 
            commodities, as the recent 150 per cent rise in the Baltic Dry 
            Freight shipping index definitely suggests. I admit, that neither of 
            these trends are remotely consensus in the foreign exchange market 
            now.<br>
            <br>
            The Japanese yen is well bid because of the bear market in global 
            equities and Wall Street’s skepticism about Treasury Secretary 
            Geithner’s bank bailout plans. Dr Copper and industrial metals are 
            still trapped in vicious bear markets as Chinese export volumes 
            plummet. However if the yen weakens and Chinese demand for iron ore 
            rises, the Aussie dollar could soar from its current 65 cents to as 
            high as 75 cents against the greenback and at least 80 yen.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Precious commodity</b><br>
            Gold is clearly the safe haven in a world of financial turmoil even 
            though inflation expectations and crude oil have fallen since their 
            July 2008 highs. I find it no coincidence that gold has broken free 
            from its traditional inverse correlation with the dollar since the 
            failure of Lehman Brothers and benefits from its increasing role as 
            a reserve asset in a world where the central bank printing presses 
            compromise the future of the dollar, Euro and sterling.<br>
            <br>
            Gold is now more correlated with mood swings in risk appetite and 
            volatility in global equities. With short term dollar rates at zero 
            and the rise in sovereign default spreads for US Treasury debt 
            (quoted in Euros, not dollar, for obvious reasons!), gold has become 
            a de facto currency that is decoupled from oil, copper and even 
            silver. International banking risk will only rise as cross-border 
            capital flows to the emerging markets plummet, with even the IMF 
            unable to prevent a cascade of sovereign defaults. It is also 
            ominous that inflows into gold coins, ETF, bars and bullions have 
            only risen even while jewellery demand in India falls.

            <b>Sovereign defaults</b><br>
            Where are the sovereign defaults that are in more dire financial 
            shape than in 1997? The Baltics, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Gulf and 
            Southeast Asia prove that construction booms driven by offshore 
            borrowing inevitably end in property crashes, corporate default, 
            bank funding crises, capital flight and high inflation. So, global 
            banks bet on Eastern Europe as a play on EU convergence. Governments 
            and entire banking systems have no access to Fed swap lines or IMF. 
            It is possible that gold prices will rise to $1100 to $1250 in the 
            next 12 months. <br>
            <br>
            The Chinese Yuan-dollar cross rate is arguably the most politically 
            sensitive strategic equation in global finance. Even though Geithner 
            lambasted China as a currency manipulator and Premier Wen Jiabao 
            railed against US protectionism at Davos, it is unthinkable that 
            Beijing will provoke a trade war with a devaluation of the Yuan. In 
            fact, the aggressive easing by the People’s Bank of China and the 
            $580bn stimulus could well cushion the plunge in export and even 
            trigger a strengthening of the Yuan. While NDF forwards suggest that 
            the currency markets believe the Chinese Yuan will depreciate to 
            7.0, I believe we could well rise to 6.60. In the short term, I 
            believe the Shanghai stock market is clearly overbought and GDP 
            growth will fall in the Middle Kingdom, the world’s second largest 
            economy. However, Chinese equities remain one of the few bright 
            spots in the emerging markets, with some fund manager flows coming 
            in to Mainland cement railroad and steel companies that will benefit 
            from the Communist Party’s infrastructure programme. The Chinese 
            Yuan could thus strengthen from the fund inflows. <br>
            <br>
            I am skeptical if the Indian Rupee can withstand a new wave of 
            global risk aversion and the politics of an election that could well 
            witness a BJP win over the ruling Congress. Bank credit, capex 
            freeze and a property crash all suggest that Indian GDP growth will 
            fall to 3 per cent, with additional FII outflows from sensex once 
            corporate earnings disappoint. The RBI will lower its repo rate to 4 
            per cent and I envisage the Indian Rupee at 52-54 against the 
            dollar.

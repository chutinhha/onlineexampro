‘Oman, a great filmmaking destination’</font></b></p>

Dearham is convinced Oman has the potential to metamorphose into a great 
filmmaking destination. It all depends on how you market it, feels the CEO of 
Film Resource Unit (FRU), South Africa. Dearham, indeed, knows better. For, he 
is entrusted with the hugely challenging task of selling South African films to 
the global audience. He heads FRU, a leading NGO tasked with the distribution of 
up to 400 social documentaries and feature films from the African continent. In 
a freewheeling interview with Mehre Alam, Dearham, who was on a visit to the 
Sultanate to attend the Muscat Film Festival, bared open his heart on a wide 
range of issues concerning the marketing of African films. <br>
<b><br>
Oman’s Plusses</b><br>
Oman, says Dearham, has unique advantages. This country, he points out, has good 
climate and fantastic locations. What it needs to develop is its service 
capacity in terms of production studios, editing studios, technicians’ skills 
and support. “I think the friendliness of the Omani people and the good security 
allows for a filmmaking destination. You need to sell it. This is a challenge.”<br>
<br>
For Dearham, this is a sure way of economic empowerment as well as for 
dispelling the many a misconceptions surrounding the Arab world. “You can start 
using films to dispel the demonized concepts attached to the Arab people in the 
West, in particular,” he emphasizes. “This is critical if we’ve to improve 
public relations and engage this Arabophobia, this terrorist-behind-every-rock 
perception.”<br>
<b><br>
Films As Trade Route</b><br>
South Africa, informs Dearham, has co-production agreements with countries like 
Canada and Italy, and memoranda of understanding with countries like India and 
Netherlands. “Our governments sit down and identify the appropriate partners and 
say: well, we’re working in a few other fields and we’ve got historical links, 
now let’s collaborate in audio-visuals as well. This preferential collaboration 
between countries is necessary, especially in the light of the WTO laws that 
treat audio-visuals as an ordinary commodity.”<br>
<br>
Dearham comes out with a formula: “As a developing country, you have to find 
ways to link up with other countries in bilateral arrangements and come to some 
agreement on different levels for preferential support, specifically on the 
audio-visual front.” <br>
<br>
How soon does he expect the film industry to shape up in Oman? “Let’s not be 
be-little the challenge of developing a business. For Oman to rise to the 
challenge of becoming a film-producing nation, it has to ask itself what it can 
do to make it different from any other country in the world today. You need to 
find that uniqueness. Is it the stories? Is it the culture? Is it the locations? 
Is it the dovetailing between different government departments and the private 
sector that makes a filmmaker want to come here? <br>
<br>
You can establish that, then package it and market it. There is no rocket 
science to this business. But to do that, you need to establish market 
intelligence. You need to know who is buying what.” <br>
<b><br>
Develop The Domestic Market First</b><br>
Dearham says his country is at a stage now where it is designing and even 
implementing strategies to take its films onto the global platform. “The first 
lesson Oman has to learn is that you must develop a domestic market. You cannot 
be thinking of international markets until you have ensured the successful 
promotion, marketing and delivery of your films at home. Secondly, the film in 
itself – as you see with Hollywood – is a powerful tool to sell the country, 
both in terms of the country as destination as well as in terms of product 
placement. Do you have any idea of how many businesses in Oman would like to 
have their products showcased in films?” <br>
<br>
Filmmakers need to be thinking about product placements, and of course, getting 
the support from the private entrepreneurs, tips Dearham. “And of course, the 
Oman government – I was very pleased to see the Oman Culture Department 
supporting this film Al Boom – needs to nurture the domestic industry. <br>
<br>
What does this mean? This means that the state needs to support and help the 
filmmaker effectively participate in the international markets. The Departments 
of Tourism, Culture, Education, Communication must integrate the strategies. <br>
Each can have a strategy and a government mandate but the integration is a 
challenge. This is what we have been grappling with down South. How do we 
integrate the national department strategies?”<br>
<b><br>
Different Marketing Strategy</b><br>
How different the strategies are for marketing African films compared to, say, 
marketing Hollywood films? “We cannot compete with Hollywood films,” quips the 
medicine student-turned-soldier-turned-film-CEO. “They have budgets in excess of 
US$50 million for blockbuster films. There is no way any local or national 
cinema can compete with this kind of marketing phenomena. In the world today, 
Oman, South Africa, and the developing South are all sailing in the same boat. 
There is this huge juggernaut in front of us. How do we deliver our images to 
people so that our products become viable and we take our place in the world of 
entertainment and media?” <br>
<br>
According to Dearham, the only way to do that is to keep the production cost 
low, and scout for segmented, niche ways of delivering image to people. 
“Segmentation of the market is critical for independent filmmakers today,” he 
says. “You cannot replicate what the monopolies, in this case Hollywood, and 
possibly even Bollywood, are doing. We do not have the critical mass. So we have 
to find ways of using new media, specifically Internet broadband delivery and 
digital hardware, in terms of production, to accomplish delivery of our 
stories.” <b><br>
<br>
Broadband Formula</b><br>
What about promoting African/Arab films via the internet broadband means? “It’s 
a new frontier,” Dearham spells out. “It’s a frontier that we have not charted 
yet. You need to firstly own the rights. <br>
Filmmakers and legislators need to understand that you need to own the right -- 
the copyright for that particular media. Too often, our filmmakers are signing 
co-production deals and signing away broadband rights to financiers who may be 
giving more to the production budget than what they are. So, retain the right! 
That’s the first lesson.”<br>
<br>
The second lesson, according to Dearham, is that in the delivery of those 
images, one needs to, just like in any other distribution pathway, sell one’s 
product. Which means one needs to understand whom one wishes to target. “Do you 
want to target educational institutions, universities, schools etc? Do you want 
to target cultural groups around the world? Do you want to target 
socio-political civil society groups? Is it the mass market in terms of retail 
outlets? Who do you wish to target?<br>
<br>
“The filmmaker must, therefore, understand what his story is about and who is he 
is making it for. Once you understood this segmentation and your primary target 
audience, then you can sell it! You may create tools through trailers and 
innovative, creative designs, and then use the broadband medium to deliver it.”
<br>
<br>
What about the financial returns? “It is of course important. You need to have 
reliable credit card mechanism so that someone in China can click on a website, 
look at a film called Al Boom, a new Omani film, and wishes to view it on 
broadband. So he swipes a credit card and there is a return of that money too 
for the filmmaker.”<br>
<b><br>
Cutting Edge Distribution</b><br>
Dearham has developed and coordinated successful implementation of cutting edge 
distribution and marketing strategies for several South African films. What 
makes his strategies tick? “The philosophy around these strategies is born out 
of a conviction that in the world of business, whoever controls distribution, 
controls an industry. And whatever commodity you are dealing with: a soap or 
images or intellectual property, distribution is critical,” he asserts. <br>
<br>
“We, in Africa, are production-led. We have been making films but we’ve not been 
thinking about the tail end of the equation, which is distribution. Therefore, I 
found it important to start looking at ways of delivering images to audiences – 
both existing and new. The existing audiences for the image was through the 
conventional mode of cinema, television, radio, DVD and even broadband (new 
media). And the new audiences were those who could not afford to view images in 
films; do not have television sets and cannot afford to buy things like DVDs 
etc.”<br>
<br>
So, what is the answer? According to the veteran film-marketing strategist, the 
answer lies in fully equipped video vans, film clubs, and student movements 
around cinema. “And these delivery methods have to be backed, of course, by 
innovative marketing strategies.” This, indeed, has been Dearham’s humble 
contribution to the African cinema for the past few years.

        <b>Double chance for South Africa at Oscars</b><br>
        South Africa has a fair chance of winning an Oscar at the 78th Academy 
        Awards, slated in Hollywood on 5 March. Charlize Theron, who won a Best 
        Actress Oscar two years ago for her role in Monster, has been nominated 
        a second time. Theron is vying for Oscar in Best Actress category in 
        North Country for her role as a woman miner fighting against gender 
        discrimination. Tsotsi, a film directed by Wits alumnus Gavin Hood, is 
        vying for the Best Foreign Film award at Oscars. The movie won the St 
        Louis Gateway Film Critics Association award and was nominated for the 
        Golden Globes and the British Academy (Bafta), where it failed to win. 
        ‘Tsotsi’ (pronounced ‘tots’ by the characters in the film) is an 
        Afrikaans word meaning ‘thug,’ and that is just what the title character 
        is. The film’s ultimate power comes from its unflinching portrayal of 
        Tsotsi as a cold-blooded, unfeeling killer. The question the film asks 
        is whether such a seemingly lost soul can ultimately be redeemed. 
        Presley Chweneyagae pulls off the near-impossible task of making 
        Tsotsi’s dramatic personality change convincing. <br>
        <br>
        South Africa is home to a $350-million-a-year film industry, but little 
        of that money is spent on South African feature films. Most of it is in 
        foreign commercials and movie shoots that use Johannesburg, Capetown and 
        other parts of South Africa as stand-ins for cities in other parts of 
        the world, and not as a backdrop for locally based stories. But that is 
        changing. Ten years ago, only one or two South African films were made 
        each year. Last year, there were a dozen. In 2005, the country scored 
        its first Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, Yesterday. 
        The film’s script centers around a woman whose husband infects her with 
        the HIV virus.</font></td>

        <b>Al-Boom: Oman's first feature film</b><br>
        Al-Boom, the first feature-length film that Oman has ever produced, was 
        premiered at the Fourth Muscat Film Festival held recently. The movie is 
        directed by Dr Khalid Al Zadjali and produced by the ministries of 
        heritage and culture, and information. The movie, featuring Oman’s top 
        actors Saleh Za'al and Zuha Kader Baksh in the lead roles, was completed 
        in 45 days. Most of it was shot in the village of Haramel in Oman. The 
        film’s story moves in a coastal town where the locals are known for 
        fishing and boat-building. As it turns out, locals’ interest in the two 
        professions has started to dwindle. Most young local men have deserted 
        the town, heading to the capital, Muscat, to look for work. They feel 
        that the sea's fortune has run short and that a container of fish is not 
        enough to fulfill their dreams and ambitions.</font></td>

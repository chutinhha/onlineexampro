			A project initiated by Bahrain’s Crown Prince and Economic

			and Social Affairs Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and EDB

			<font face="Verdana" size="1">T</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">he initiative looks part of a grander scheme. Bahrain is clearly 
			going the whole way. Only recently, the Council of Representatives 
			(lower house) -- in a landmark development for trade unionism in 
			Bahrain -- approved a draft law that bans unfair dismissal for trade 
			union activity. There, clearly seems to be a method to these 
			initiatives. <br>
			<br>
			Explains Dr Jasim Husain Ali, Head, Economic Research Unit, 
			University of Bahrain: “Labour market reform initiative is part of a 
			wider reform initiative. There are three elements here: labour 
			reforms, economic reforms, and educational and training reforms. We 
			started with labour market reforms because labour is a critical 
			issue in the country. Many thought we should have started with 
			economic reforms. But since unemployment is a big problem in the 
			country, the authorities decided to start with labour market 
			reforms.”<br>

			<img border="0" src="covers1.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2"></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Inevitable</b><br>
			In a way, the labour market reform initiative was inevitable. And 
			the question really was ‘when’, rather than ‘whether!’. Consider 
			some of the concerns staring straight at the face of the Bahraini 
			economy. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Concern One:</b> Over the next decade, nearly 100,000 Bahrainis will 
			enter the labour market, requiring the Kingdom to provide three 
			times more jobs than it did in the past decade. And the Kingdom’s 
			current economic model will not be able to provide enough jobs for 
			Bahrainis, as the historic reliance on public sector employment is 
			no longer sustainable. <br>
			<b><br>
			Concern Two:</b> Bahraini salaries have been falling for the past 15 
			years and will slip further if nothing is done. The average wage for 
			Bahrainis was Bahraini Dinars (BD) 420 in 1990. It had declined to 
			BD352 in 2002, and is predicted to drop down further if the Kingdom 
			fails to take remedial steps. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Concern Three:</b> Bahrainis are not wanted by the private sector, which 
			is more comfortable hiring expatriates.<br>
			Says Economic Development Board vice-chairman Dr. Zakariya Hijris: 
			“Bahrain must shake off the bad habits of the past to create real 
			job opportunities. It has for too long structured its economic 
			growth on reducing labour costs, rather than increasing 
			productivity.” <br>
			<b>
			<br>
			Basic Idea:</b> <b>Labour Market Governance</b><br>
			So, what exactly is the basic idea behind the labour market reform 
			initiative? Quips Dr. Jasim: “The idea is to make Bahraini nationals 
			the “employees of choice” in the private sector. This is the first 
			major goal. And for that, the procedure is to apply fees on 
			companies for hiring expatriates. Make the expatriates more 
			expensive. The second goal is to allow free movement of expatriates 
			in the job market.” </font></p>

			<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Labour Market Authority </b><br>
			The policy reform package, in fact, has been designed to be both 
			robust and flexible in order to quickly and seamlessly respond to 
			changing market conditions. The robustness and flexibility of the 
			system are fostered through the creation of a new regulatory body, 
			the Labour Market Authority (LMA). This body will play two roles. 
			One, it will develop labour market policy and two, it will act as a 
			one-stop shop to manage labour market administration. <br>
			<br>
			Within the scope of developing policy, the LMA will become the 
			consolidator of all labour market data. By doing this, the LMA 
			ensures the consistency, quality and usability of market 
			information. It also ensures that policy development is closely 
			aligned to market information and, thus, reflects the needs and 
			changes of the labour market.<br>
			<b><br>
			Labour Fund</b><br>
			Now, the money raised through the proposed labour fees will be 
			collected into a Labour Fund to be used for specific purposes, 
			including supporting the locals in securing private sector jobs and 
			investing in the private sector to assist in adjusting to the new 
			policies. <br>
			<br>
			To ensure this, the fund will have several key features. First, it 
			will be accounted for and administered separately from the normal 
			government budget as an independent fund. Second, it will be 
			professionally managed to ensure appropriate returns and judicious 
			planning. Third, its governance structure will involve key 
			stakeholders, who will be able to participate in the 
			decision-making. Fourth, the management and use of the funds will be 
			transparent so that it is clear to all stakeholders how the funds 
			are being used so that decision makers can be held accountable for 
			their decisions. Finally, mechanisms will be established to provide 
			an added level of comfort that the funds are in fact being used in 
			proper ways.<br>
			<b><br>
			A Kind of Tax?</b><br>
			Is it a kind of tax to be imposed on the private sector? “Yes it 
			is!” says Dr. Hussain M. Al Mahdi, Chairman of Gulf Global 
			Consultancy and a leading economist and thinker (See interview). “As 
			of now, an employer needs to pay BD110 to bring an expatriate, which 
			includes the training levy, work permit and the tax for new work 
			permit. What McKinsey has proposed is that the private sector pays 
			an additional BD75 every month as fees. So the total comes to BD185 
			per month. It is also proposed that companies pay another BD25 per 
			month for renewal. The total cost for hiring an expatriate in two 
			years will now come to over BD2,400. This is very high.”<br>
			<br>
			Agrees Dr. Jasim: “It’s a kind of tax. But many countries have this 
			system where they consider hiring expatriates a luxury. We in 
			Bahrain have calculated that every expatriate costs the government 
			BD40 ($115) a month. This covers things like health, use of roads, 
			electricity, water, security etc. There is a cost to be paid on 
			behalf of the Bahraini society to hire expatriate labour force.” <br>
			<br>
			But, has this model been tried out anywhere else? The answer is yes. 
			Hong Kong, Japan, most of Europe and North America, Singapore, 
			Indonesia, and Malaysia, all have some sort of fee and/or quota 
			system to regulate the inflow of foreign labour. In fact, Bahrain 
			and the other Gulf countries have among the world’s most lax 
			regulations on in this regard. <br>
			<br>
			Here is another eye-opener example: In Southeast Asia, countries 
			with labour costs significantly higher than neighbours have 
			attracted bulk of foreign investment. Philippines, Malaysia, and 
			Hong Kong have labour costs 30-90 per cent less than neighbours, 
			Singapore and South Korea, but still attract far less foreign 
			investment<br>
			<b><br>
			Bahrain’s Competitiveness in Region</b><br>
			Will this reform affect Bahrain’s competitiveness in the region? The 
			question has been uppermost in the minds of many. In fact, the 
			companies relying heavily on low cost expatriate labour will be the 
			ones affected most by the proposed reform policy. But then, this 
			segment currently accounts for only 10 per cent of foreign direct 
			investment (FDI) flows into Bahrain. And then, almost 90 per cent of 
			FDI flows into Bahrain are in sectors like real estate, banking and 
			finance, and communications and transportation (Source: EDB). None 
			of these sectors rely on low cost labour.<br>
			<b><br>
			Minimum Wage Versus Reforms<br>
			What about enforcing minimum wage as a superior alternative to the 
			proposed reforms?</b><br>
			While it is true that many successful economies use a minimum wage. 
			However, those economies have far fewer expatriates in their labour 
			markets. In addition, the minimum wage tends to be set at a level 
			that provides a safety net for only a small percentage of the labour 
			force (an average of 7 per cent across several OECD countries) 
			rather than as a means of improving the welfare of a large portion 
			of workers (Source: EDB). Now, it will have two implications:<br>
			• If Bahrain were to enforce a standard minimum wage across both 
			Bahrainis and expats, 80 per cent of the proceeds of the wage 
			increase would accrue to expats (Source: EDB).<br>
			<br>
			• A differential minimum wage – one for Bahrainis and a lower one 
			for expats – would simply entrench the existing cost differential 
			between Bahrainis and expats, further hampering the ability of 
			low-skill Bahrainis to compete with expats for private sector jobs. 
			Consequently, Bahrainisation targets would become even more 
			important to securing Bahraini employment, but would be increasingly 
			difficult to enforce. Bahraini unemployment would not be improved.</font></p>

			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Concern Over Bahrainisation</b><br>
			There is a general apprehension with regard to Bahrainisation. What 
			happens if private companies stop recruiting locals once the reforms 
			are implemented? According to the EDB version, equalizing costs 
			between expatriates and Bahrainis through the use of labour fees and 
			other policy levers will allow Bahrainis to compete with expatriates 
			on a level-playing field. As long as Bahrainis are able to 
			demonstrate the required work ethic, good attitude, and basic 
			skills, employers will not have a cost incentive to hire expats, the 
			EDB contends. Private sector employers will instead have a strong 
			incentive to find Bahrainis to employ before hiring expats. <br>
			<br>
			Moreover, the proposed policy package includes a series of 
			employment programs that will subsidize Bahraini employment through 
			wage subsidies, better matchmaking between employers and prospective 
			employees, and basic job readiness training. Employers will hire 
			Bahrainis because it makes good business sense, EDB contends.<br>
			<br>
			Besides, during the transition period, Bahrainisation will not be 
			eliminated all at once to ensure that Bahrainis do not experience 
			unnecessary dislocation.<br>
			<b><br>
			<img border="1" src="covers1c.jpg" width="114" height="161" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">Expat Angle</b><br>
			Says Dr. Jasim: “One thing is for sure, the labour market is not 
			going to stay the same. We also have cases of misuse and 
			mistreatment of expatriates. Many of them are not being treated 
			properly; they are not getting salaries on time; many are living in 
			shabby conditions. But once the labour market reforms come into 
			effect, those exploiting the expatriates will be denied the chance 
			to do so. Expatriates will have the freedom to change jobs.”<br>
			<br>
			However, the expatriate angle is turning out to be a real challenge. 
			Already, there are murmurs of protest. According to a report 
			published in a Bahraini daily, expatriate workers have been excluded 
			from the purview of the labour law for private sector and that 
			articles related to them have been removed from the labour law bill. 
			This has prompted Bahraini human rights activists and trade unions 
			to mull challenging the draft law prepared by the Ministry of 
			Labour.<br>
			<br>
			Says Dr. Jasim: “There are no hard feelings against expatriates 
			here. Bahrain would always need expatriates. The only question is: 
			to what extent, and how many? As of now, 57 per cent expatriate 
			figure is relatively high for Bahrain.<br>
			<br>
			“Locals constitute only 43 per cent of the labour force in Bahrain. 
			Now, this is abnormal in the sense that we have this problem of 
			unemployment here. Unemployment among locals stands at around 14 per 
			cent. This certainly is a serious problem for the country.” <br>
			<br>
			And he adds: “For skilled expatriates, there will always be the 
			demand. For the un-skilled expatriates, it may not emerge a very 
			friendly situation. If the situation is not remedied, we will only 
			be inviting problems.” <br>
			<b><br>
			Delayed</b><br>
			Bahrain is all set to venture into un-chartered territory. The 
			journey, however, has got a bit delayed. “It should have been 
			implemented in the beginning of January 2006. However, it is being 
			delayed because of disagreements among the concerned parties,” 
			informs Dr. Jasim. “It might be launched on July 1, 2006. Otherwise, 
			it may get delayed until January 1, 2007,” he adds. <br>
			<br>
			There is some curiosity about the status of the proposals now. “It 
			is with Bahrain’s Parliament, which has to approve it. Right now, 
			lobbying is being done to influence the voting of the MPs. We are 
			all awaiting the outcome, but it looks like the MPs are going to 
			approve it,” asserts Dr. Jasim.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
			Dr. Jasim further adds: “Many in the business community are not 
			happy with the proposals. They contend that allowing expatriates to 
			move freely in the job market will only cause problems. In hiring 
			expatriates, they undertake certain costs. Now, suddenly, 
			expatriates will be free to change jobs. Then, what’s the point of 
			spending money on them, employers say. They are also apprehensive 
			that company secrets can be traded. And, companies will try to 
			attract the best of talents by offering them better salaries. Then, 
			they are not happy with the very idea of increasing fees for hiring 
			expatriates.” <br>
			<br>
			What could be the stand of the MPs? “Well, they may demand some 
			changes. They might say that the fee for hiring expatriates should 
			not be so steep. There could be some attachments (conditions 
			attached to that),” predicts Dr. Jasim.<br>
			<b><br>
			Tightrope Walk</b><br>
			Isn’t it a tightrope walk for the authorities? Sums up Dr. Jasim: “I 
			think the authorities are very careful. They will not antagonise the 
			business community. They want to go slowly. In fact, one suggestion 
			is to implement it in certain sectors of the economy, like the 
			financial services. They may delay its implementation in the 
			construction sector until the very end as it employs a heavy 
			population of expatriates.” <br>
			<br>
			Timeline is crucial for such an initiative. “In all likelihood, the 
			proposals are going to be passed in March or April,” Dr. Jasim makes 
			a guess. “At the end of the day, if the private sector is not 
			pleased, some of them might even think of relocating to some other 
			country.” </font></p>

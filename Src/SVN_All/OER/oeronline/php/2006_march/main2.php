Networking Business unit of HP (Hewlett-Packard </font>
<font face="Verdana" size="1">Development Company), the 
suppliers of enterprise networking solutions comprising wired and wireless 
networking products, services and solutions, recently organised its first-ever 
Middle East conference. The company announced the launch of a set of Layer 3 and 
4 LAN switches that feature wirespeed performance and integrated Gigabit Power 
over Ethernet (PoE). Ahmed Khatib, the company’s Business Development Manager 
for the Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean region, in an interview with OER, talked 
about his company’s plans for the Middle East region, where it is growing at 
over 50 per cent. Excerpts: <br>
<b><br>
What are your expectations from these new products? </b><br>
In 1998, ProCurve launched some products - the 4000 and 8000 series - that 
disrupted the market. Three years later, we launched the 5300 series. We have 
been gaining market share with each and every such launch. We believe that the 
2006 launch of the 5400 series, and all the other products that we are 
launching, will again make a disruption in the market and we’ll gain a 
considerable market share.<br>
<b><br>
There is this perception that HP products are not targeted at high-end users in 
the Networking. Do you see this perception changing in the near future?</b><br>
The definition of high-end users differs from region to region. We are not into 
home office connectivity and products. I think the perception in the Middle East 
region is totally different. We have been investing in the Middle East for the 
last two-three years. The perspective and the awareness level are changing. The 
numbers conclusively show that: our revenues have doubled in the last three 
years. <br>
<br>
Let’s talk, for example, about the Omani market. We have very enterprising 
customers using ProCurve in Oman. ProCurve enjoys one of its best market shares 
in Oman. <br>
<b><br>
Can you quantify the Omani figures? </b><br>
We can’t but I can tell you that the growth in Oman is amazing. Our growth 
figures for the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region is around 25 per 
cent per year. But we are growing at more than 50-60 per cent per year in the 
Middle East. <br>
<b><br>
How important is the Middle East market for ProCurve? </b><br>
For ProCurve, it’s a very important market in the EMEA perspective. We want to 
up the ante in this market. And, we are investing in the region. When we started 
investing in the region, we had just a few employees here. But now, we are 
launching call centres; we have engineers; we have sales people dedicated for 
different countries. <br>
<b><br>
Why did you host the ProCurve conference in Dubai last month? </b><br>
Dubai is becoming the hub of the Middle East. It’s a future city. We believe 
that launching our products in Dubai is like launching them in the centre of the 
Middle East. <br>
<b><br>
What kind of impetus will your new products give to ProCurve in the Middle East?
</b><br>
These products are positioned for the medium-end enterprises. For example, in 
the 5400 series, we are the only one in the networking market to offer products 
like 1200 and 1000, with power and Internet switches. <br>
<br>
We believe that our products are no longer optional items for the customers. 
Intelligence is becoming more and more important in this age. That’s why we are 
having these functionalities integrated in our switches. This will obviously 
push up the demand for our networking solutions. Besides, we are offering the 
latest technology at affordable price. We believe our new products will make a 
real disruption in the market. <br>
<b><br>
Is connectivity a challenge in the Middle East? </b><br>
It’s a challenge everywhere, and not in the Middle East alone. Security is 
definitely an issue for medium-end enterprises with regard to wireless 
communication. That’s why we are trying to reinforce the message that our 
products are intelligent at the edge of the network and we provide security at 
the edge of the network. <br>
<br>
We are launching products that will provide authentication and authorisation to 
the user at the edge of the network. This means we’ll protect the data centre, 
which, in turn, implies that we’ll protect the connectivity at the data centre. 
The solutions that we provide will enhance security at the wireless edge too.<br>
<b><br>
Where is your focus likely to be in the coming years? </b><br>
I am responsible for the Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean. We are eying a minimum 
50-60 per cent growth in the market share this year. <br>
<b><br>
What, according to you, are the USPs of ProCurve? </b><br>
We have many USPs. Price performance leadership in the market, reliability and 
reduced complexity, choice of flexibility, security of the product as well as of 
the partner, and transparent standards are our strong points. <br>
<b><br>
How important is intelligence in the networking solutions? </b><br>
We believe that the future applications require better intelligence features. We 
make the rules and push them to the edge of the network. For example, 
authorisation and authentication will now happen at the edge of the network. <br>
<br>
ProCurve enjoys a fair share in the Omani market in networking <br>
<b><br>
solutions. What are your expectations this year? </b><br>
We have been working in the Omani market with our elite partner for about 
four-five years now. We have been registering an annual growth of 30-40 per cent 
in the market share. I strongly believe that we’ll have a 400 per cent growth in 
the Omani market. <br>
<b><br>
Do you see the relationship with your elite partners in Oman growing? </b><br>
We recently had an elite partners MEA event, where we gave away country-specific 
awards. IMTAC bagged the award for the Middle East region for being the best 
elite partner in the region. For the last 2-3 years, the business has been doing 
really well. We believe in IMTAC. They really are the elite partners for 
ProCurve in this region.</font></p>

		<b>ProCurve Networking by HP expands functionality <br>
		</b><br>
		ProCurve Networking by HP has introduced a set of Layer 3 and 4 LAN 
		switches that feature wirespeed performance and integrated Gigabit Power 
		over Ethernet (PoE). <br>
		<br>
		Setting a new standard for intelligent edge switches, the ProCurve 5400 
		chassis family and ProCurve 3500 stackable family together scale across 
		a range of 24 to 288 Gigabit ports with identical features, performance 
		and lifetime warranty. Both are based on the ProVision™ ASIC, the fourth 
		generation of custom-designed ASICs from ProCurve that deliver 
		intelligence and control to the edge of a network. The ProVision™ ASIC 
		provides all the performance and functionality needed today and also 
		provisions for future application needs.<br>
		<br>
		The new switches enhance ProCurve’s Adaptive EDGE Architecture by 
		delivering advanced functionality to the network edge to meet the 
		evolving needs of security, mobility and convergence applications. <br>
		<br>
		“Customers no longer have to compromise among functionality, performance 
		or Power over Ethernet because ProCurve is delivering all three at a 
		price customers are used to paying for any one of those capabilities,” 
		said Wenceslao Lada, Vice-president and General Manager for ProCurve 
		Networking, EMEA. “Just as the ProCurve 4000 series in 1998 and the 5300 
		series in 2001 helped ProCurve become the industry’s number-two 
		networking vendor, we expect the 5400 and 3500 series will fuel our 
		continued industry leadership.”<br>
		<br>
		ProCurve also announced the ProCurve 4200 switch family, the ProCurve 
		6200 Switch, and a new media-flexible 10 Gigabit module for the ProCurve 
		8100 series.</font></td>

March 23, the captains of corporate Oman will come together at a high-powered 
networking event - OER CEO Golf 2006. While keen golfers will play the 9 hole 
Stableford, non-golfers will get a chance to be initiated into the sport by a 
professionally-conducted Golf Clinic. <br>
<br>
And there’s more: the Champion will walk away with a Rolex watch, courtesy 
Khimji’s Watches. That’s for the serious players. Again, this should not 
dishearten the “neophytes”. They can also win mouth-watering prizes such as Sony 
Bravia LCD Television, Holiday packages and other exciting bonanzas from Muscat 
Electronics, Sun City, Qatar Airways Holidays, Samsonite Black Label, Ray Ban, 
Radio Shack, Chedi Muscat, the Hyatt … <br>
<br>
The crowning glory of this event will be Glow Golf or Golf by Candlelight. 
Imagine playing golf under the canopy of dark blue skies of Oman in the month of 
March! If one has not experienced it, now is the chance, courtesy the Oman 
Economic Review’s prestigious OER CEO Golf 2006, slated on 23 March 2006.<br>
<br>
Reflecting its reliance on nothing but excellence, OER has associated with Tiger 
Sports Marketing, the prestigious marketing arm of the Indian PGA, to conduct 
the most prestigious corporate event in the Sultanate of Oman. <br>
<br>
OER’s endeavor is powered by the presenting sponsors, Oman Mobile, the 
Sultanate’s leading mobile service providers, in association with Zubair 
Automotive and Muscat Golf &amp; Country Club. What has brought the big guns from 
the business world of Oman to join hands is a question best answered by the 
industry captains. Hearken to them, uninterrupted:<br>
<br>
“I see a bright future for golf in the Sultanate of Oman. On the one hand, it 
has proved to be popular among Corporate Chiefs and on the other; you have 
professionals who are showing a keen interest in the game across the Gulf 
region. Once Oman begins to sport green courses, the floodgates will be thrown 
open and there will be no turning back. The entire Gulf region is quickly 
emerging as a 'must do' destination for golf professionals and amateurs,” says 
Dr. Amer Awadh Al Rawas, MD of Oman Mobile.<br>
<br>
According to him, it is a proud moment for Oman Mobile, as he adds, “Oman 
Mobile, as the leading mobile service provider in the Sultanate of Oman, is 
proud to be involved with events of this magnitude as a presenting sponsor. We 
are delighted to be associated with Oman Economic Review, organizers of CEO 
Golf.” Oman Mobile was associated with OER CEO Golf last year also.<br>
<br>
Zubair Automotive, the associate sponsors for this event, is a name that is 
immediately recognised as a by-word in automotive quality and reliability. They 
are the authorised distributors for Dodge vehicles in the Sultanate. Says Justin 
Barnett, General Manager: “Golf has not really taken off in Oman, but with the 
advent of tournaments like this and the future of grass courses, it surely will. 
In fact, I am surprised by the fact that such a large number of people are 
attending the event. Some of them are not golfers but want to become. It shows 
the event is genuinely generating interest in the game. Historically, there has 
been an association between golf and business. While I don’t profess to be a 
golfer, I look forward to being involved in the event, which is a friendly 
tournament, with all major industry captains participating in it. This provides 
a good opportunity for business interaction as well.”<br>
<br>
Adds Bob Seshadri, Group Marketing Manager: “This event is a platform to promote 
Dodge. It is a brand that signifies strength, freedom and independence, 
something that all golfers associate with. Both the Dodge Charger and Durango 
have been well received in the market for their dependability, durability and 
innovation”. <br>
<br>
Muscat Country &amp; Golf Club, another prestigious associate sponsor of the OER CEO 
Corporate Golf 2006, is equally rejoicing in hosting the event. “Other than the 
obvious interest and excitement as developers of what will be the first jebel 
and wadi grass golf course in the Sultanate, we are extremely keen in the 
development of other grass golf courses in the Muscat region,” explains Michael 
Hywel-Davies, secretary of the Club. He does not see other courses as 
competition but rather as essential partners in the drive to bring “golf 
tourism” to the Sultanate.<br>
<br>
Davies brims with confidence over the future of Oman as a golf destination for 
all and sundry. “Given the steady rise in the numbers of golfers worldwide, the 
increasing ease of intercontinental travel and the drive to promote the 
Sultanate as a destination of choice for the discerning tourist, the future 
looks very bright indeed,” he says, and adds, “The future for Muscat Golf &amp; 
Country Club and also other groups, who are developing golf courses, looks 
great. It augurs well for the youth of Oman who will benefit by learning the 
game and from the tourist influx that will undoubtedly provide employment 
opportunities.”<br>
<br>
Times of Oman and Al Shabiba have also chipped in as the media partners for the 
OER CEO Golf 2006. Essa bin Mohammed Al Zedjali, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of 
Times of Oman said: “Golf is finally coming of age in Oman with a number of 
world-class golf courses on the anvil in the Sultanate. OER CEO Golf 2006 is an 
ideal platform to promote the game of golf in Oman. As the leading media group 
in Oman, we are proud to partner this endeavour to prop up golf among the 
corporate leaders in the Sultanate.”<br>
<br>
All said and done, the big event is just round the corner. Get ready to tee off! </font></p>

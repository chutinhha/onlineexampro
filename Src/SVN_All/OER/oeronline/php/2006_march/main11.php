world demands that we take a novel approach to propelling our societies into the 
future. Groundbreaking ideas and cutting edge advances, these are the hallmarks, 
and the building blocks, of this new generation in the making. <br>
<br>
That's just the kind of progress organizers of the first World Summit on 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship (WSIE) are aspiring to spur with a gathering of 
800 hundred of the world’s foremost innovators and entrepreneurs who are all 
converging in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman between April 1-3, 2006, to take on the 
challenges of tomorrow with a common objective in mind: to create sustainable 
opportunities for future generations in emerging nations.<br>
<br>
Under the support of the United Nation Development Program, the United Nations 
Economic &amp; Social Commission for Western Asia, and the United Nations Economic 
Commission for Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, this unique event – largest 
gathering of its kind in the Middle East – is hosted by the Sultanate of Oman, 
and represented by Public Establishment for Industrial Estates. <br>
<br>
“It gives us immense pride to host the WSIE in the Sultanate of Oman, which is 
on the threshold of an economic revolution and is one of the most promising 
emerging markets,” said H.E. Eng. Ahmed Al Dheeb, Under-Secretary, Oman’s 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry.<br>
<br>
The landmark summit will provide government officials, business leaders and 
educators a forum to share ideas and forge new partnerships that will help 
people living in emerging markets from Asia to Africa to the Middle East.<br>
<br>
“The Summit is being hosted at the right time as it highlights the growing 
importance of not only the Sultanate but the entire Middle East region. Through 
this endeavor, we wish to engage young nationals in creating jobs for 
themselves, thereby improving their livelihoods. I am confident that the Summit 
will benefit each one of us to share our ideas and forge new partnerships that 
will help people living in emerging markets like Oman,” added H.E. Al Dheeb. Sam 
Hamdan, Chairman of Global Leadership Team, the strategic development and 
execution leader of the event concurred and highlighted the significance of 
holding the summit in the Middle East as: “a region that is witnessing 
phenomenal growth in non traditional industries. This growth will need to be 
sustained beyond the initial boom and therein lies the challenge.”<br>
<br>
The three-day conference will present a knowledge-sharing platform for the

backgrounds and covering different expertise. <br>

together for this Summit. WSIE will create a network community for innovators 
and entrepreneurs who share the focus on emerging nations. Top representatives 
from the regional and international business community will communicate how 
emerging nations can best prepare themselves for global competition,” Hamdan 
added.<br>
<br>
Together with an impressive collection of over 90 renowned speakers from across 
the globe, this landmark meeting of minds will lay down the foundations of 
making innovation and entrepreneurship work for emerging nations, and help them 
achieve global competitiveness by focusing on key initiatives and actions 
through three days of roundtables, town hall meetings, interactive workshops, 
and thematic meetings – where all will express the Summit theme “A Better 
Generation in the Making. ”<br>
<br>
Commenting on the WSIE, Mishal Hamed Kanoo, Deputy Chairman of The Kanoo Group 
said: “The Kanoo Group has always been admired for its global vision and has 
remained committed to the progress and development of the entire region. The 
private sector in the region has a pivotal role in creating opportunities for 
future generations. Keeping this in perspective, the Group was of the view that 
the World Summit of Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship is the perfect platform to 
communicate these messages as it will be the largest gathering of its kind to be 
held”.<br>
<br>
“We at Cisco are proud to support the WSIE, which is aimed at enabling the Arab 
World achieve global competitiveness. Entrepreneurship and innovation is 
synonymous with Cisco's corporate personality and is strongly reflected in 
providing support to our customers,” concurred Samer Alkharrat, General Manager

most difficult challenges.</font></p>

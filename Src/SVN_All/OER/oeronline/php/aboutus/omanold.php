        the visionary leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, the 
        Sultanate of Oman has seen the benefits of development in every area - 
        be it social, political, industrial or its human resources. Today it is 
        a strong, thriving economy where a traditional form of Government has 
        led the way for the foundation of a modern state - one that marches with 
        the rest of the world. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The last two decades especially have been all about progress and growth, 
        and these changes encompass every aspect of modern-day living today — 
        from the socio-economic infrastructure to technological progress to 
        health care to professional manpower. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oil was the economic mainstay in the 70s and Oman’s main source of 
        income, but His Majesty’s vision has seen that Oman’s economy today has 
        diversified and introduced wide-ranging structural reforms to make it a 
        global player in many fields. With privatisation, Omanisation, 
        expansions in the non-oil sector, lifting of impediments in most sectors 
        to Foreign Direct Investment, a sound socio-economic infrastructure, a 
        professional manpower base and streamlining business regulations, the 
        outlook for the Omani economy is extremely bright. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oman’s health care system is today recognised as among the best in the 
        world by the World Health Organisation. Its history of a flourishing 
        international trade is today reflected in its successful accession to 
        the World Trade Organisation, besides it being a founder nation in the 
        recently established Indian Ocean Rim Association. Of late, Oman has 
        also completed Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the United States. 
        Oman’s high credit ratings with international agencies, its political 
        and economic stability with a relatively low debt obligation, its 
        ranking as the most transparent nation in the Middle East and North 
        Africa and the second free economy in the region only goes to highlight 
        its innumerable accomplishments. These achievements also show that Oman 
        is a capable player in the global scenario of capital, technology, trade 
        and co-operation. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This book celebrates this very phenomenon and is dedicated to His 
        Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, the Sultan of Oman, the visionary and 
        founder of modern Oman. It is only because of and with his wisdom and 
        foresight that Oman has been inspired to take its rightful place on the 
        frontiers of global development, while still preserving its unique 
        culture and values. <br>
        <br>
        The guest writers in this book are all experts in their respective 
        fields and are well known and respected individuals who have been and 
        still are a part of this progress and change. We thank them for their 
        generosity and spirit and for sharing their thoughts and knowledge with 
        us. <br>
        <br>
        It is an honour to present this book to you. We realise that it will 
        greatly illuminate your national pride and reinforce the feeling that 
        Oman not only stands out in the region, but that its brilliance reaches 
        the far corners of the world! </font></p>

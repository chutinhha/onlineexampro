				Power and utilities businesses must assess their core assets and

				competitive in the transformed market<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				In the last article, we looked at the lessons learned by banks 
				as they respond to the economic crisis. In this article, we look 
				at how power and utilities companies react to the crisis and 
				plan for the road ahead. Power and utilities companies held up 
				well in the global recession compared to other industries but 
				there are lessons from change that are taking on new importance 
				for these companies as well, to thrive in the new economic 
				environment.<br>
				<br>
				The simple model of providing power, collecting revenue and 
				securing rate increases is disappearing. The power and utilities 
				sector faces a lengthy period of transformation. New power 
				plants will be needed but given the higher costs of construction 
				and financing, power and utilities companies will be under 
				greater pressures to plan for long-term investment. The industry 
				cannot maintain the status quo. Companies must make tough 
				decisions today.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tomorrow’s infrastructure<br>
				</b>The power and utilities industry must undertake a massive 
				investment to address global challenges in new ways. As new 
				technologies find their way to emerging markets and the 
				recession lifts, power demand is expected to surge. The sector 
				faces a lengthy period of active transformation that is 
				projected to continue for some time. These changes are driven by 
				the need to decarbonise energy supplies, reduce exposure to 
				volatile commodity markets and embrace new, “smart” 
				technologies, while continuing to show a profit under evolving 
				market conditions. <br>
				The major challenges in transforming the industry are:</font><ul dir="ltr">

				<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Cash preservation<br>
				</b>Power and utilities companies have historically been 
				perceived as a safe business and investment haven. To some 
				extent this perception is still justified particularly given the 
				recession’s heavier impact on other industries. However, cash 
				can no longer be taken for granted. The recession saw customer 
				demand decrease, bad debt increase and credit become less 
				available. Worldwide, companies have had to be much more 
				proactive in their cash management. Power and utilities 
				businesses with substantial trading positions must maintain 
				adequate reserves to cover adverse movements in commodity 
				prices.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Counterparty has counterparties<br>
				</b>Financial instability in key suppliers can prove to be a 
				lethal contagion for any business. Counterparty risks can be 
				found within several degrees of separation from the business. 
				Ongoing assessment of counterparty risk can help prevent a 
				crisis. In addition, diversifying the supply base is a 
				straightforward way to reduce counterparty risk. Now more than 
				ever, it is important to achieve and maintain a strong credit 
				rating.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Identifying key risks<br>
				</b>Today’s power and utilities companies must also be risk 
				management companies. For power and utilities companies, 
				strategic risk arises directly from the new low-carbon agenda, 
				the increasing insecurity of traditional energy supplies and a 
				potential skills gap. These new strategic risks, driven by the 
				transformation agenda, could fundamentally change the industry’s 
				entire risk profile. As customers and trading counterparties of 
				energy companies continue to struggle, credit risk continues to 
				be an important consideration for the sector. The risks of 
				long-term storage, capacity or transportation contracts should 
				continue to be evaluated, but power and utilities companies need 
				to go further, assessing the full spectrum of potential risks.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Remaining alert<br>
				</b>While operational effectiveness is always important, 
				adaptability has become an increasingly essential trait. The 
				strong impact of the global financial crisis has elevated the 
				existing focus on performance improvement. New operational 
				models need to be adopted to help the power and utilities 
				industry recalibrate its business successfully as it transforms, 
				particularly around carbon reduction and green initiatives.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Technology is a wise spend<br>
				</b>Creating more effective and efficient IT systems has a 
				massive influence on cost containment and reduction. New IT 
				systems are especially needed in the case of recent carve-outs. 
				With significant changes on the horizon — including advanced 
				metering, smart grids and low-carbon generation — legacy systems 
				are unlikely to be able to meet even medium-term needs.<br>
				<br>
				The current economic crisis has also had a positive effect on 
				financial transformation initiatives in the sector. Financial 
				information affects every part of an organisation and many 
				utilities companies are now seizing the opportunity to match 
				best practice with other sectors.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Embracing change<br>
				</b>There can be no doubt that the significant strategic changes 
				in the power and utilities industry during the last five years 
				have been heightened by the economic crisis. Economists globally 
				are associating green technologies as the next driver for 
				growth.<br>
				<br>
				All players in the industry should be prepared to pinpoint 
				exactly where the business stands in the value chain and build 
				the best case for that position. To prepare for a low-carbon, 
				competitive landscape, any asset acquired must fit into a 
				portfolio of activities that respond to an impending reality. 
				And low-carbon, renewable resources, nuclear power, advanced 
				carbon capture technology and smart-grid capabilities are 
				components of the energy portfolio of tomorrow.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Anticipation and agility<br>
				</b>In this sector, regulatory decisions are one of the most 
				important factors in investment. As the supply chain and the 
				market become more complex, there is a strong need for companies 
				to maintain close relationships with regulators, governments and 
				customers, which will allow them to explain the realities of 
				delivery against the expectations for change.<br>
				<br>
				While the credit markets are beginning to loosen, access to 
				capital will undoubtedly continue to be relatively tight during 
				the next 18 to 24 months. Companies needing cash will have to 
				dispose of noncore assets, with a view to minimising losses.<br>
				The transformation agenda<br>
				<br>
				Power and utilities companies have not been as severely affected 
				as other sectors by the financial crisis and the downturn. 
				Although industrial power demand has been hard hit, demand for 
				energy among residential customers is relatively stable. To some 
				extent, government support and subsidies have leveled out demand 
				fluctuations. However, the sector has faced increased financing 
				costs and problems accessing finance.<br>
				<br>
				The main lesson from this downturn is that the business 
				environment is more challenging. Decisions must be faster and 
				bolder, and based on a clear vision and a core strategy that 
				embraces the transformation agenda. Executives, who show 
				ingenuity, have the courage to make tough decisions and 
				demonstrate the foresight to apply lessons from change will 
				guide their companies to success in the power and utilities 
				sector. They will be the leaders who establish the foundation 
				upon which our new global economy will rise. </font>

					Awards held at Shangri-La’s Barr Al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa on 
					June 12, 2010 proved to be a memorable affair. The venue was 
					turned into a veritable green enclave with over 200 plants 
					on display, inspired rockery and an artificial waterfall. 
					The lighting and music added to the ambience. <br>
					<br>
					While the atmosphere may have been surreal, the seriousness 
					of issue at hand was not lost on anyone. Business leaders 
					and senior government officials had gathered to honour 
					companies, institutions and individuals who had shown 
					remarkable environmental initiative. In his inaugural 
					address Sandeep Sehgal, Chief Executive, UMS called upon 
					everyone to contribute their mite to the environment. Lamees 
					Daar, Executive Director, Environment Society of Oman, 
					focussed on the imminent threat to the environment and asked 
					companies to look at saving the environment as a part of 
					their corporate social responsibility. <br>
					<br>
					The Guest of Honour, HE Sayyid Hamood bin Faisal al Busaidi, 
					the Honourable Minister of Environment and Climate Affairs 
					and HH Sayyid Tarik bin Shabib al Said, Editor-in-Chief, 
					Oman Economic Review handed over the awards to the winners.<br>

							<br>
							<b>One Earth: One Choice: Make it Now!</b><br>
							The plantain tree (Scientific name: Musa acuminate 
							and again musa balbisiana) is an edible fruit plant 
							widely grown commercially in Sri Lanka and other 
							South East Asian tropical countries. Traditionally, 
							farmers cut off the stem of the plant and discard it 
							once the fruit has been removed from the plant, 
							leaving it to die. The discarded plants usually 
							become garbage, polluting its surroundings as it 
							slowly rots above the ground. <br>
							<br>
							The Oman Green Awards plaque was specially made out 
							of banana barks discarded from plantations in Sri 
							Lanka. The effort was to reuse this natural resource 
							and to extend its life-time and usefulness, 
							underlining the adage: reuse, reduce and recycle.

					campaign conveyed the intended message about a healthier, 
					cleaner and greener tomorrow</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Haya Water launched one of the biggest awareness campaigns 
					to preserve the environment and apply safety procedures at 
					its work sites in 2010. The challenge for the company was to 
					create awareness and correct perceptions in the minds of 
					people about Haya Water’s activities and to let them know 
					about the great efforts being made by the company for the 
					benefit of the residents and visitors of the Muscat 
					governorate. The strategic approach adapted, given the 
					objective was to create awareness about the benefits of the 
					brands. The campaign was supposed to set the tone for 
					communications targeting specific locations where the laying 
					of pipelines for a greener future were being laid and 
					educating the audience about the real time benefits. <br>
					<br>
					<b>A metaphor<br>
					</b>All of this was made possible through an integrated 
					communication approach with a mix of above the line, below 
					the line and social media platforms which reinforced the 
					message. The ongoing advertising campaign aims to change the 
					mindsets and position of Haya Water as the harbinger and 
					enabler of a sustainable future.<br>
					<br>
					Communication was designed to be simple, clean and easy to 
					comprehend. This was in view of the diversity of the target 
					audience. The clean layouts extended the company’s healthy, 
					clean and green cause. The underlying theme of the entire 
					campaign was ‘Green’. Green for a greener and cleaner Muscat 
					which was ‘eco-friendly.’ <br>
					<br>
					The campaign addressed people across age, gender and 
					nationality in Muscat. It was an integrated one making use 
					of different mediums and multiple messages. The immediate 
					response was an increased level of awareness about the brand 
					Haya Water and a correct interpretation of its activities 
					and services. <br>
					<br>
					The most tangible proof of the success of the campaign is 
					the growing fan base of Haya Water (group) on social 
					networking site Facebook. The medium is now also a platform 
					allowing the brand and its target audience to interact 
					constantly. The campaign has increasingly seen support and 
					appreciation from well wishes.<br>
					<br>
					The Muscat wastewater project is one of the biggest 
					environmental projects in Oman. In this project sewage water 
					is converted from materials that cause harm to the 
					environment into environment friendly products. Within this 
					project, sewage networks, water treatment plants and TE 
					networks for distributing the treated water used for 
					irrigation, gardening and other usages are carried out. This 
					is in addition to constructing a plant for converting solid 
					wastes resulting from the sewage treatment into organic 
					fertilisers.</font></td>

				In December 2010 the Sultanate will welcome athletes from 45 
				countries across Asia to compete at the 2nd Asian Beach Games 
				Muscat 2010. The Muscat Asian Beach Games Organising Committee 
				(MABGOC) has launched the Muscat 2010 Mascots - Al-Jebel (Tahr), 
				Al-Med (Green Turtle), and Al-Reeh (Houbara) representing the 
				sky, land and sea in Oman respectively. The effort is to promote 
				the natural beauty of Oman to the countries and regions 
				attending the beach games and to highlight the importance of 
				protecting and conserving these animals and their habitats for 
				future generations. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Out of the box<br>
				</b>An innovative method was crafted to address ‘real issues’ 
				through a fictional platform. On October 31, 2009, MABGOC 
				presented the mascot concept to the Olympic Council of Asia’s 
				(OCA) executive board at the 55th OCA executive board meeting in 
				Hanoi, Vietnam. The executive board approved the concept and the 
				initial steps in this direction have been taken by creating 
				visuals ‘drawings’ of the mascots.<br>
				<br>
				Over the coming months MABGOC will distribute material and 
				information on the ideals of the mascots. Children’s storybook 
				will be launched prior to the Games, and ‘real life mascots’ (ie 
				costumed mascots) will be available for community 
				activities/events and photo opportunities with the public. The 
				Muscat 2010 website will soon provide a Mascots section 
				providing further details about these three friends. The mascots 
				will spread their message both in English and Arabic within Oman 
				and across Asia. The mascot story and messages will highlight 
				the importance of these animals within the Sultanate and the 
				natural settings in which they are found.<br>
				<br>
				The MABGOC has been the first Games under the Olympic Council of 
				Asia to dedicate its mascots to the protection of the 
				environment. ‘Environment’ is one of the most important theme 
				globally in the 21st century for sustainable development and 
				coexistence, and the OCA is working to deliver this message to 
				the 45 National Olympic Committees (NOC) across Asia. Amongst 
				other activities, the OCA has created a new initiative to 
				recognise the efforts and achievements of its 45 NOCs in 
				tackling environmental issues, and the Oman Olympic Council saw 
				an opportunity to highlight the importance of environmental 
				protection during Muscat 2010.</font></td>

				The core purpose of Six Senses Resorts &amp; Spas is to ‘create 
				innovative and enlightening experiences’ that rejuvenate its 
				guest’s love of ‘Slow Life’ (Sustainable-Local-Organic-Wholesome 
				Learning- Inspiring- Fun-Experiences). Six Senses Hideaway Zighy 
				Bay recognises that its operations affect the surroundings and 
				the resort is committed to improve its ecological and carbon 
				footprint and to give back to the community.<br>
				<br>
				At the heart of the resort’s responsible practices is the 
				implementation of an Environmental Management System based on 
				the Six Senses Holistic Environmental Programme and Green Globe, 
				designed to continuously improve its performance and to 
				benchmark efforts. Through this the resort strives to ensure 
				that it improves its ecological and carbon footprint through 
				raising environmental awareness into the day to day lives of 
				hosts, guests and the local community. One of the ways in which 
				the resort contributes to sustainable development of the region 
				is through the Social and Environmental Responsibility Fund 
				where 0.5 per cent of the resort’s total revenue goes towards 
				both environmental and community projects in Zighy Bay, the 
				Musandam region and the rest of the Sultanate of Oman.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Environmental projects<br>
				</b>The Six Senses Holistic Environmental Management Programme 
				(HEMP) focuses on improving the ecological and carbon footprint 
				of Six Senses operation. HEMP sets out the principles, 
				guidelines and standards for responsible operation and 
				constitutes the framework of Six Senses Hideaway Zighy Bay’s 
				Environmental Management system.<br>
				<br>
				The sustainability policy is the resort’s guiding document and 
				Green Team meetings ensure frequent and regular follow-ups of 
				environmental issues in all departments. Like all Six Senses 
				Resorts, Six Senses Hideaway Zighy Bay follows the Green Globe 
				Company Standard, an international sustainability certification 
				scheme for hotels, resorts and spas. The task during the first 
				year is to set up a functioning environmental management system 
				and to collect data of water and energy consumption, waste 
				generation, paper use, chemical and pesticides use, and social 
				commitment. Once the resort is Green Globe benchmarked the 
				performance of the second year is compared to that of the first 
				year in each of the respective areas. The resort will then have 
				the benchmarking results audited to achieve Green Globe 
				Certified status.<br>

				</b>During the design and construction of Six Senses Hideaway 
				Zighy Bay, care was taken to design the resort according to the 
				traditional Omani style. The use of natural material, naturally 
				ventilated areas and shaded areas to minimise the need for 
				air-conditioning and lighting, reduces the resort’s need for 
				energy. An outdoor Omani summer house has been re-created for 
				guest use and is made from Jareed (date palms) that have been in 
				twined in the traditional way allowing the temperature inside to 
				drop a few degrees for comfort.</font></td>

				especially in emerging markets. The goal of the project is to 
				ensure that BankMuscat finances projects that are developed in a 
				socially responsible manner. The bank keeps a track of the 
				projects financed through the concerned department to ensure 
				that they are in line with the Equator Principles. The bank 
				reports back every two year to the Equator Principles.<br>
				<br>
				The bank has also joined the United Nations Environment 
				Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), which is a unique global 
				partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme 
				(UNEP) and the global private financial sector.<br>
				<br>
				<b>First amongst peers<br>
				</b>BankMuscat is the first bank in the Middle East region to 
				adopt the ‘Equator Principles’ and join the UNEP-FI thus 
				becoming a role model in preserving the environment and adhering 
				to best practices. The bank is committed to financing 
				environment-friendly projects for life. <br>
				<br>
				Internally, the bank is promoting environment friendly practices 
				among its employees. For example, it recycles waste paper 
				produced by various departments in BankMuscat’s head office 
				building. To make the process more scientific, it tracks the 
				amount of paper collected and sent for recycling. Between May to 
				Oct 2009, the bank saved 17 trees through recycling around 1,975 
				kgs of waste paper. Paper recycling is an ongoing project whose 
				operations are managed by the support services department of 
				BankMuscat. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)team will 
				keep encouraging employees through internal communications via 
				e-mails and presentations on the importance of saving paper, 
				water and electricity.<br>
				<br>
				The bank is encouraging employees and their families to reduce 
				wastage of water and electricity. Office utility bills are 
				tracked in an effort to minimise waste. Calico bags are used for 
				collecting waste paper instead of plastic ones. The bank’s CSR 
				team visits employees at the head office giving them 
				presentations on green tips along with distributing green gifts.<br>
				<br>
				As a result of these measures employees of BankMuscat are (and 
				will be) more aware about the best practices related to the 
				environment. These measures will also help the bank to reduce 
				spends both internally and externally. A leader in the financial 
				sector, the bank is demonstrating its CSR credentials with these 
				socially responsive measures.</font></td>

				acres of land and over the last 22 years the resort has gone on 
				to develop 350 acres of acres of barren land into lime 
				plantations, green houses and nurseries, resort, spa, rainforest 
				restaurant, rose, solar and jojoba gardens and agricultural 
				lands which include banana plantains, sugar cane, vegetable and 
				natural foliage waste areas for compost development. Says 
				Stephen Hatton, general manager, Al Nahda, “We have combined 
				natural science and art to create gardens and greenery which are 
				beautiful, culturally rich and eco-sustainable.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Multiple benefits<br>
				</b>The effort of the resort is to create major landscape 
				changes which provide recreational, agricultural, horticultural 
				and nature reserves for the benefit of the local community which 
				operate within a green area protection plan and improved 
				eco-sustainable practice over a total land area of 350 acres.<br>
				<br>
				The resort uses a variety of innovative methods to apply and 
				promote sustainable design. The talented design team worked 
				together to develop various ideas such as use of gray water, 
				organic management of the gardens, transitioning from little to 
				no synthetic pesticide and composting of dead foliage for use as 
				fertiliser. The reduction of the usage of water and its 
				conservation has been achieved through water-efficient 
				landscaping or Xeriscaping. The process is one of the biggest 
				reasons that ensures the sustainability and viability of the 
				resorts plantations. Resource efficient landscapes are the way 
				forward for truly effective continuity.<br>
				<br>
				Plants that are drought-resistant and indigenous to a region’s 
				soil and climate conditions can survive and thrive, generally 
				with less care or water. The use of native plants is also 
				environmentally preferable because they are more resistant to 
				pests and disease, thus requiring less fertilisers and 
				pesticides. Long-lived, hardy vegetation can lower labour costs 
				and reduce spending on maintenance supplies.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Grand vision <br>
				</b>Says Hatton, “We are all inspired by the vastness of our 
				company’s endeavours and have adopted a re-use, re-buy, re-cycle 
				and reduce mentality.” The 22 year dedicated programme shows 
				incredible fortitude and persistence from the Al Bhaja Group, 
				which owns Al Nahda. The group has demonstrated environmental 
				change over 350 acres of previous barren lands.<br>
				<br>
				The development has led to a number of benefits for the local 
				community like the creation of new job opportunities, cost, 
				waste and energy efficiency, improved air quality, reduction of 
				harm to the environment, providing habitat to wildlife and 
				healthier places to work in and a place where people can come 
				with their families to for recreation purposes. Positive changes 
				like the one created by Al Nahda makes a difference and creates 
				benefits both for the short and long term. The resort is a 
				living example of how human efforts can contribute towards a 
				greener world.</font></td>

				Catch them young seems to be the motto of Gardening World Oman. 
				The company is working on creating eco friendly redevelopment of 
				schools grounds in the Sultanate. The company aims at involving 
				children at every level to understand the importance of saving 
				the environment. <br>
				<br>
				Says Ali al-Abdullatif, managing director, Gardening World, “The 
				project started with the desire to demonstrate that everyone can 
				play a part in helping the environment if they have an 
				understanding that it is about what we do on a daily basis and 
				how plants can play a significant part in environment 
				preservation.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Flora and fauna</b><br>
				Located in Ghala as a part of the project, Ali has had two 
				sessions with the children, the first to show them the 
				importance of saving a native tree and secondly educating them 
				on how to prepare a tree to be moved from one location to 
				another. The project design has also included many native, near 
				native and traditional plants which require less water 
				naturally.<br>
				<br>
				Once the children had gone through this theoretical exercise, 
				they pruned the tree themselves and did the work to prepare the 
				tree to be moved. Each child and the teachers had a part to play 
				and they learnt the process first hand. <br>
				<br>
				Gardening World is an ongoing project which will involve 
				children from all nationalities. A number of these students have 
				motivated others to contribute to a greener Oman. “The key 
				phrase we have applied in our business plan and business card is 
				the slogan, ‘The pioneers of Eco landscaping’ foresight and 
				persistence,” says Ali. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Long term goal </b><br>
				The company has started to propagate native plants and plans to 
				develop this further to a fully fledged Omani native plant 
				nursery with plants for sale as well as for projects. Each plant 
				will have a write up on the significance, origin and benefits to 
				the environment.<br>
				<br>
				Gardening World is looking at saving plants in perpetuity that 
				are naturally being destroyed by the rapid growth and urban 
				development in Oman. Once people are more aware, they will be 
				more receptive towards landscape projects. This will ultimately 
				reduce the amount of water used to keep Oman as beautiful as it 
				is and will sustain the ecology and preserve the flora and 
				fauna. The company has a long term vision and its efforts and 
				work is sure to help in preserving the environment in Oman.</font></td>

				Al Sodah Island a project being developed by Muriya Tourism is 
				designed as an ‘ecolodge development’ to meet the principles of 
				eco-tourism (a nature dependent tourist facility) in Oman. 
				Located 32 kms from the mainland of Dhofar it is designed to 
				meet the equator principals of eco tourism, by developing a 
				project and charting a path towards sustainability and 
				environmental protection.<br>
				<br>
				The project endeavours to maximise the use of natural light 
				through design. Environment friendly lighting principles are 
				being be used to limit turtle attraction. Low density building 
				and infrastructure design will minimises adverse environmental 
				impact. An in- depth Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study 
				has been conducted by a leading environmental consultant and the 
				recommendations of the study are being used. Muriya is doing a 
				management of environmental impact through preparation and 
				implementation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) 
				following ISO 14000 protocols. Site selection and design has 
				been done to avoid native vegetation and to protect threatened 
				species, populations and ecologically sensitive areas such as 
				turtle nesting beaches.<br>
				<br>
				To ensure periodic environmental monitoring, a specialist 
				environmental consultant carries out an on-site quarterly 
				review. The project will maintain the abundance, species and 
				geographic diversity of corals and marine turtles. All wastes 
				will be removed off-island. Pests (brown rats) that feed on 
				breeding bird colony eggs will be eradicated and regular beach 
				clean-ups will be undertaken. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Success principles<br>
				</b>The project planning and design is largely based on nature 
				dependent tourism principles. Monitoring and regular internal 
				audits have been conducted to modify work practices and improve 
				environmental outcomes. An EIA has been prepared to ensure all 
				the adverse environmental impacts are mitigated and in progress 
				for a EMP roll out. The Marine Turtle Management strategy has 
				been initiated for proactive protection of these species on the 
				island. Floating jetties to prevent any adverse impacts on the 
				coral reefs are being designed and implemented. The ideas and 
				strategies were chosen after a rigorous site Environment Health 
				and Safety (EHS) compliance and extreme environmental site 
				vigilance by the site EHS staff, innovative design team and the 
				concerned departmentt.<br>
				<br>
				Says Muthu Govindraj, Corporate HSE director, Muriya Tourism, 
				“The project is unique and will lead by example as an eco 
				friendly tourist destination in Oman and finally with the use of 
				alternative energy sources technology it is anticipated to be 
				the most green island project in Oman.” <br>
				<br>
				The project is in line with Murya’s core philosophy of light 
				construction and having 70 per cent as free and open areas. In 
				the long term, Al Sodah hopes to be the most effective eco 
				friendly habitat in Oman with significant nature dependence and 
				with very low contribution to global warming.</font></td>

				humidity and temperature ( 25 degrees +/- 2% &amp; 45 % RH +/- 10%) 
				of 0.22 microns. Air filtration or air expelled to environment 
				from all the 35 air handling units is clean as it is filtered

				in house supply avoiding the accumulation of plastic containers. 
				Water for all industrial use is purified in house as a first 
				step, the industrial used water is treated and analysed as per 
				Oman Environmental Regulation and then used for irrigation of 
				the green part of the site. The size of green land on the 
				factory is 20 per cent as compared to the total site area (40 
				per cent when compared to open land) with five palm trees and 
				other flowery trees. All sanitary waste water outlets are

				in this system is not released into the atmosphere but is 
				treated and dissolved in water. It is then released into the ETP 
				where the same is treated and then released. NPI has 
				demonstrated its concern for preserving this scarce resource by 
				utilising the waste water (duly treated) to maintain its 
				greenery (consistently over the past 10 years) thereby serving 
				the dual purposes of greenery and water conservation. It extends 
				this training to students from other colleges in Oman every

				Bahwan Engineering Company – Carrier (BEC-Carrier) has been 
				promoting environmentally sound cooling solutions amongst 
				various buildings in Oman. This is being achieved through the 
				promotion of Energy Efficient Carrier 30XA chillers. The 
				chillers result in lower electric energy consumption as compared 
				to other similar chillers in the market. The installation of 
				such chillers has led to an annual saving of electric energy to 
				the tune of 22.9 million KwH.<br>
				<br>
				Knowledge drive<br>
				BEC-Carrier has been spreading knowledge about its energy 
				efficient products through technical seminars, factory visits, 
				one-to-one discussions with consulting engineers and building 
				owners. As a result of these efforts a number of companies, 
				institutions and owners have installed and benefitted from such 
				solutions. Says a company spokesperson, “A number of consulting 
				engineers, building owners are more aware about the benefits of 
				using energy efficient products and have started insisting on 
				using such products for their projects.”<br>
				<br>
				Globally, Carrier’s competitors are striving to manufacture 
				products which match Carrier 30XA chillers in energy efficiency, 
				but the company remains a leader by a stretch. With the 
				relatively low cost and adequate availability of electric energy 
				in the Sultanate, the need for having energy efficient systems 
				was not felt for a long time. BEC was the first company in the 
				country to start spreading awareness about the benefits of 
				energy saving products in partnership with global leaders such 
				as Carrier, Bry Air, SPC, Ruks etc. It is the result of such 
				persistent efforts that more and more buildings are now being 
				built with the attendant environmental impact in mind.<br>
				<br>
				Every building in Oman will continue to require cooling 
				(Air-conditioning). Air-conditioning systems are a major user of 
				electric energy in any building and the use of energy efficient 
				air-conditioning products and systems is thus a very sustainable 
				initiative for the future.<br>
				<br>
				The focus on improving energy efficiency of air-conditioning 
				products/systems and the use of innovative methods to reduce 
				power consumption of air conditioning system can only further 
				improve the situation in the long run. The company sees its 
				efforts as being a mere beginning of an awareness effort towards 
				the need for energy conservation in buildings – this awareness 
				will, in the long term, result in design and construction of 
				buildings which are more energy efficient.</font></td>

				successfully completed more than four years of its operations in 
				the Sultanate of Oman. Its business model helps companies to 
				save money by recycling their printer cartridges. The company 
				has a manufacturing unit for recycling laser toner cartridges 
				and a warehouse in Ruwi to serve its large client base. It’s 
				customers include ministries, banks, real estate and 
				construction companies, embassies, private colleges, power 
				companies, finance companies, investment and securities 
				companies, home users etc. <br>
				<br>
				Printer cartridges are one of the leading contributors of 
				contamination and runoff in a nation’s landfills. Cartridge 
				World is committed to the highest environmental standards in its 
				own right, seeking to minimise material waste, through 
				recycling. The company has been at the forefront of cultivating 
				a habit for recycling by collecting tonnes of electronic waste 
				for proper recycling.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Omani first<br>
				</b>It’s laser products are locally re-manufactured and are 100 
				per cent guaranteed within the OEM (Original Equipment 
				Manufacturer) stated warranty. Based on the service cycle, the 
				appropriate parts are replaced with new parts. Great care is 
				taken to ensure proper assembly and 100 per cent test prints 
				prior to delivery. The company has tied up with PEIE (Public 
				Establishment of Industrial Estates) Rusayl to use the Omani 
				logo, since the Cartridges are remanufactured locally in Oman. 
				In brief, Origin Oman products offers every Oman based resident 
				an opportunity to help promote the Sultanate’s products and 
				services and by doing so helps create employment opportunities, 
				stimulates the national economy and reduces carbon emissions. 
				Remanufacturing cartridges locally supports the local community 
				by creating more job opportunities.<br>
				<br>
				Cartridge World has been successful in placing recycling bins 
				and encouraged recycling habits. It provides printing tips for 
				an environment friendly office and has been propagating 
				recycling habits by placing advertisements in leading newspapers 
				and magazines thereby lessening the amount of cartridges ending 
				up in the landfills of Oman.<br>
				<br>
				Cartridge World provides a programme to help customers easily 
				identify issues, products and services with the environment in 
				mind. It is focusing on the importance of recycling as it is not 
				only beneficial for the earth but also for businesses as the 
				latter can secure a better relationship with their consumers by 
				showcasing their environment efforts. As recycling reduces 
				production costs it proves to be economical for consumers. 
				Cartridge World and its customers are working together for 
				making a difference to the earth’s health. Recycling along with 
				reducing consumption is our best means to counter the damage to 
				the Environment of Oman and Cartridge World is throwing its 
				weight behind this cause.</font></td>

				Indian School Nizwa’s (ISN) Green Clean Earth campaign 
				endeavours to make the earth a better place to live in for us 
				and the future generations. The goal of the campaign include 
				making Oman a plastic free zone. As a start the school has made 
				its campus plastic free. The students are also creating 
				awareness about harmful BT products and their consequences. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Making a difference</b><br>
				ISN celebrated Earth Day on April 22, 2010. The theme for this 
				year’s Earth Day celebration was – ‘Make each day an Earth Day’. 
				Posters, charts and models were placed all around the school to 
				promote awareness among students about earth day; a special 
				assembly was conducted by the students of class 12. <br>
				<br>
				During the assembly, important thoughts and ideas were conveyed 
				about Earth Day. The seniors also shared tips to save nature and 
				on how to reduce the depletion of resources. Facts and 
				statistics related to earth helped the students to realise how 
				human efforts were damaging the planet. The principal then spoke 
				about Earth Day highlighting the agenda that the students should 
				follow. <br>
				<br>
				An Earth Day oath was taken where the students swore that they 
				would strive to protect the earth, they live in. The celebration 
				went on as students of senior classes spread the message of 
				mother earth through effective speeches. Later on students from 
				class 11 presented videos and powerpoint presentations related 
				to Earth Day to junior classes which made students aware of the 
				potential danger that could follow if no one cared for earth. 
				Students circulated brochures informing students and parents 
				about the harmful effects of BT products during the school 
				event. Shopkeepers in vicinity of the school agreed not to sell 
				harmful BT products. Students pledged to plant trees in the 
				school’s neighbourhood and to reduce the use of plastics and 
				polythene bags. H E Anil Wadhwa, ambassador, Republic of India 
				to Oman appreciated the schools efforts in promoting environment 
				protection. <br>
				<br>
				The students are confident that through their selfless 
				commitment and dedication, they will achieve their goals. By 
				educating the future generations the school is increasing the 
				chances of having a green earth and living on a smarter planet. 
				The spark ignited by the school is sure to snowball into a blaze 
				in the years to come.</font></td>

				The ABA School’s wide ranging initiatives that challenge and 
				promote change by highlighting common, environmentally 
				unfriendly practices has to a large extent ingrained in the 
				student community the message that individuals can make a 
				difference.<br>
				<br>
				The school looked at continuity and sustainability as one of the 
				guiding principles by providing opportunities and incentives to 
				the students themselves to lead the charge in order to bring 
				about a change in daily practices. Further, in deciding which 
				initiatives to pursue and which to leave for later, ABA looked 
				at cost effectiveness, impact, visibility and sustainability.<br>
				<br>
				For example, the composting project was the work of students 
				where the idea was to compost as much of the school’s waste as 
				possible and use as little from outside as possible. ‘Energy’ 
				monitors were appointed in each of the junior classes. These 
				students monitored a variety of activities including turning off 
				lights and computer monitors when they leave the room.<br>
				<br>
				The school is also inculcating responsibility by initiating a 
				‘don’t walk by’ campaign for everyone who enters the campus; 
				forming a student group for preparing and planting native plant 
				areas; and assigning the students to write an ‘green’ article 
				every week for the school’s newsletter.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Small but promising start<br>
				</b>Says Terry Storer, examinations officer, ABA, “This is a 
				team project that is supported by all members of the school 
				including the administration, teachers, students and parents. We 
				have been running with this for about 18 months now. From, what 
				seemed to be a very humble beginning with small goals, the 
				number and range of projects and people involved continues to 
				grow as the relevance, scope and impact is seen and felt.”<br>
				ABA feels that they are dealing with students who will, in many 
				cases, go on to become major decision and policy makers of the 
				future. Any role modelling and sensitisation they can achieve 
				will have a ripple effect that is hard to quantify. </font></td>

				<br>
				Global warming is such an oft-repeated term that, somewhere 
				along the line, people have stopped relating to it. Therefore, 
				Pravin Amudan’s desire was to translate words into action and 
				that came about in the form of “The Little Green Guide”, a 
				bilingual (English and Arabic) booklet with over 70 easy and 
				practical tips to help counter the global warming phenomenon.<br>
				<br>
				The first print-run of this guide was 2000 copies and was backed 
				by a host of related environment-friendly activities and got 
				wide coverage in all the media.<br>
				<br>
				“The idea of this ‘tips-book’ is to drive home the fact that 
				each one of us can make a positive difference to the environment 
				by taking small, simple steps. For example, it could be as 
				simple as changing one 60-Watt light bulb to a CFC,” says Pravin 
				Amudan.<br>
				<br>
				To further his initiative, Amudan also created a blog (<a href="http://www.thelittlegreenpage.blogspot.com">www.thelittlegreenpage.blogspot.com</a>) 
				where people can post their comments, share their ideas and 
				download the online version of the book to spread the word. A 
				dedicated email address (<a href="mailto:thelittlegreenguide@yahoo.com">thelittlegreenguide@yahoo.com</a>) 
				has also been created for enquiries and feedback.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Join the movement<br>
				</b>Besides the booklet and the blog, Amudan also initiated a 
				recycling drive (paper and plastics) in his workplace of DDB 
				Oman, which is part of the OHI group; and in his neighbourhood 
				on a monthly basis with the support of the Environment Society 
				of Oman (ESO). Over the last two years, around 2.5 tons of paper 
				has been recycled within his office and he believes that this is 
				just the beginning.<br>
				<br>
				Taking his environment campaign a step further, Amudan also 
				began to advocate eco-friendly initiatives among a number of DDB 
				clients in Oman. <br>
				<br>
				For example, the 2009 calendar with the global warming theme by 
				Towell Auto Centre, the dealers for Mazda in Oman was inspired 
				by him. Secondly, the ‘Work Environments and the Environment’ 
				booklet for Mustafa Sultan Office Technology, which was 
				distributed at the launch of Kyocera eco-friendly printers in 
				2008, was conceived by him. In addition, an internal ambient 
				media campaign targeting the employees of DDB and encouraging 
				the responsible use of hand tissues in the washrooms was 
				launched at his behest. Each of these initiatives required 
				dedication and commitment, when faced with the arduous task of 
				reminding people, following up for permissions and executing 
				projects. The fact that Amudan’s efforts, however small they 
				might have been, have inspired people to change is his greatest 
				reward.<br>
				<br>
				Adds Amudan, “Each time I see a colleague or a friend contribute 
				towards this initiative, I consider it a measure of my success. 
				If I can influence even a handful of people to think twice about 
				wasting natural resources, I will feel my attempt has been 
				worthwhile.”</font></td>

				The students of Majan College led by Ojas Bhatia have been in 
				the forefront of not only spreading environmental awareness but 
				are also in the process of manufacturing clean energy devices 
				for sustainable development.<br>
				<br>
				Says Bhatia, “As students we have discussed about solutions that 
				can be implemented in Oman at a very low cost and can help a lot 
				of people. For example, Dean Kamen (another student) has made a 
				device which can take any source of water filled with pollutants 
				and can change it to pure drinking water. The device costs 
				around RO400 and can help provide water for over 500 people. We 
				are in talks with the company to deploy this system in the 
				interior of Oman.”<br>
				<br>
				Bhatia says that as an individual, he is trying to spread the 
				message about the environment among the youth by holding 
				discussions and debates about the results of global warming and 
				how clean energies can be deployed worldwide.<br>
				<br>
				“Our aim is to bring about awareness on environment preservation 
				and sustainable development by talking about solutions that are 
				best suited for the environment and debate about carbon 
				trading,” Bhatia adds.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Spreading awareness<br>
				</b>He wants to ensure that apart from Omanis, the topics 
				related to environment should also reach the GCC youth through 
				regional environmental debates and spread the message using the 
				media like newspapers and radio.<br>
				<br>
				In 2008, Bhatia won the All Gulf inter-college environmental 
				debate. In 2009, he was chosen by Muscat Municipality to spread 
				awareness among students during the environmental week. Now in 
				2010, he has been chosen to go to the Youth Assembly at the UN 
				headquarters in New York. This speaks volumes about his vision, 
				foresight and persistence.<br>
				<br>
				As a role model, Bhatia has inspired other youth to take keen 
				interest in participating in the environmental activities and he 
				continues to inspire his fellow students.<br>
				<br>
				Since it is the youth that is going to be leading the green 
				efforts in the future, their empowerment is necessary. They are 
				the ones who will come up with innovative solutions that are 
				going to benefit the world, Bhatia believes.</font></td>

				Crowne Plaza Sohar gave a new lease of life to the word 
				‘garden-fresh’ literally with a backyard full of freshly 
				sprouting herbs and vegetables. It was little wonder then that 
				it won the ‘Green Innovation Award’ at the Oman Green Awards.
				<br>
				<br>
				The hotel introduced a separate corner at the buffet table for 
				food cooked from naturally grown vegetables and herbs as a 
				choice and preference for the guests. And the management says 
				that it has been the delight of the hotel guests to have freshly 
				plucked, safe and fully organic vegetables for their salads and 
				vegetable dishes.<br>
				<br>
				Jann Nasri Bahdousheh, purchasing manager and environment 
				projects leader says, “we initiated the ‘Organic Garden Project 
				– 001’ to grow fresh vegetables and herbs as an environmentally 
				safe project in order to place full organic cooked food on our 
				buffet table.”<br>
				<br>
				Talking about the benefits of this move, Bahdousheh says this 
				project has an impact on the quality of food, service and 
				guests’ satisfaction scores. He also points out that the hotel 
				is more interested in becoming environment-friendly more than 
				any financial gains from the project, which in any case are very 
				negligible in the beginning.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Green message<br>
				</b>In order to propagate and promote this project, the hotel 
				designed and printed awareness posters and created educational 
				packages and organised small talk shows for guests, management 
				and staff.<br>
				<br>
				The Organic Garden project became a great motivator for everyone 
				to contribute to a greener Oman as the hotel made efforts to 
				achieve the Hotel Wheel Goal with a responsible business term 
				known as ‘Green Engage’. <br>
				<br>
				The aim of this Green Engage is to ensure continuity and 
				sustainability of the Organic Green project and make it an 
				educational and awareness tool.<br>
				<br>
				Green Engage will be used for different purposes namely, to give 
				a choice to the hotel guests to use environment-friendly 
				products; propagate the green culture amongst the hotel staff, 
				and increase general environmental awareness among the local 
				community. </font></td>

				Many clients have welcomed the initiative of GoPoint Ta’meer to 
				implement green elements in their real estate projects. And one 
				of the biggest real estate developer in Oman is considering 
				using their system to build more than 250,000 m2 of buildings 
				due to high-energy savings that the system offers.<br>
				<br>
				“Since the beginning GoPoint Ta’meer’s client-based approach 
				helped us to penetrate the market with seamless efforts, by 
				considering the clients’ perspective. All GoPoint Ta’meer’s 
				current and future projects will use EVG-3D system as standard 
				system,” says Eyhab Al Hajj, managing director, GoPoint Ta’meer.<br>
				<br>
				The secret of the success is the EVG-3D panel system – a 
				foam-steel composite that creates a tightly sealed building 
				envelope, making the home efficient and strong. Structurally, 
				the goal is to build the house to withstand extreme weather with 
				use of EVG-3D panels anchored to reinforced concrete 
				foundations.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Inviting nature<br>
				</b>By using alternative green and innovative construction 
				system i.e. EVG-3D panels, the model home is designed to be open 
				and welcoming, maximising natural light while minimising passive 
				solar heating in the warm climate. It allows for natural 
				ventilation and steady airflow, reducing the need for air 
				conditioning and heating.<br>
				<br>
				It has dark flooring, which reduces the shines in the afternoon 
				light and white coloured walls to provide maximum lights 
				reducing the need for artificial lighting during the day.<br>
				<br>
				By demonstrating the actual result of its green initiative and 
				the unforeseen benefits of the system, more green initiatives 
				will be promoted via bundled services that GoPoint Ta’meer 
				proposes to project owners. Along with lead consultants, GoPoint 
				Ta’meer is working closely to introduce the concept of green 
				housing in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				“When we first started operations, our Chairman made an 
				important comment saying, this is going to be the future of 
				construction. We have since worked on this basis, and the 
				message has been spreading to our clients, partners and 
				suppliers. We however, believe this system will further increase 
				its market attractiveness since we are planning to commission 
				factories in Oman soon and thus provide even greater value for 
				money,” says Al Hajj.<br>
				<br>
				Requests have come from major developers in Oman to carry out a 
				combined study in seeing the effect of building communities with 
				this system. This is driven by the belief that such systems mean 
				significantly less electrical consumption and thus a more 
				environment-friendly solution.</font></td>

				A team from the department of Soil, Water, Agricultural 
				Engineering (SWAE) of Sultan Qaboos University undertook an 
				unique agriculture activity in which different types of small 
				crops were cultivated in pots filled with three types of soil – 
				coarse sand, recharge dam silt and soil from the SQU 
				Agricultural Experimental Station plot.<br>
				<br>
				The pots were placed in an open area of the roof of SQU 
				buildings and water was diverted to the pots from containers 
				through siphons made of used T-shirts, which were rolled and 
				filled with soil. Siphoning flow rate, moisture content in the 
				pots, hydrological parameters and the development of the plants 
				were measured and monitored.<br>
				<br>
				The team members of this project were Prof Anvar Kacimov, head 
				of department; Jokha Al Issai, masters student; Muna Al Amri, 
				lab supervisor; and Mohammed Al Balushi, senior technician from 
				the SWAE department.<br>
				<br>
				Feasibility of further greening of roofs of Omani houses and 
				their passive thermal insulation was assessed. Pot modules at 
				the extreme temperature and dryness of Omani climate proved to 
				be efficient thermal insulators of the roof and suitable bio 
				medium for plants.<br>
				It is a novel irrigation system with continuous (annually) 
				irrigation without any scheduling and does not involve 
				additional labour; and meets optimal crop-water requirements. 
				The system also does not utilise any electrical energy and 
				brings huge electricity savings as well because by cooling the 
				roof, the use of air-conditioning is reduced.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Novel irrigation<br>
				</b>Along with improving building thermal regimes and flood 
				attenuation the collateral benefits are: Utilisation of 
				otherwise idle roof space; cheap and simple subsidiary farming; 
				direct roof-to-family supply of basic vegetables in urban 
				households; recycling used family cloth and plastics; engaging 
				urban family members in agricultural activities.<br>
				<br>
				Daily-average temperature of the roof is shown to have reduced 
				by 6-8 degrees in June with mid-day temperature peaks reduced by 
				more than 20 degrees.<br>
				<br>
				Several plants (ivy, sunflower, succulents and others) are shown 
				to grow well on the roof when the maximum concrete/gravel 
				temperature of the roof reaches more than 70 degrees.<br>
				<br>
				The capillary siphoning of green roofs has been tried at SQU 
				since 2001 and the siphons are mechanically robust. Water supply 
				to the tanks is as sustainable as the house or building itself. 
				Soil is less sustainable due to secondary salinisation but 
				common leaching can be practised. Siphoned pots served as good 
				buffers for regular regional rainfalls. </font></td>

				The Mist-Catcher Project for re-vegetation of the mountainous 
				area in Dhofar is designed to combat desertification caused by 
				over-grazing in the region. This will be done by transplanting 
				indigenous plant species in affected areas and growing them by 
				irrigation using water collected from mist by mist-catchers 
				during the Khareef season, the June-August period when rain and 
				mist settle on the hills and mountains of Dhofar.<br>
				<br>
				The Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs (MECA) has 
				commissioned this project in association with Mitsubishi 
				Corporation (MC). Describing the project’s importance, Tomoo 
				Shoji, senior manager, says, “At the plateau areas of 
				mountainous areas in Dhofar, their original vegetations have 
				been severely damaged by over-grazing by domestic animals for 
				long time. This is a kind of typical desertification. This 
				project is aimed at recovering the original rich vegetation in 
				the areas to combat on-going desertification by transplanting 
				indigenous plant species using water collected from mist by 
				mist-catchers during Khareef.”<br>
				<br>
				The facility was constructed and began to operate in June 2009. 
				Even though Khareef 2009 was weak and with short period, the 
				facility collected around 200 cubic metres of water. Nearly 250 
				seedlings of local plants were already transplanted at the end 
				of August and the beginning of September 2009 and have been 
				irrigated every three days consecutively during Khareef and 
				every five days during the rest of the period. Once the trees 
				grow and grow into forests, more water will be collected to grow 
				more vegetation. This recovered vegetation will be able to 
				supply water to the groundwater table enhancing fresh water 
				resources in Dhofar.<br>
				<br>
				As of April 2010, more than 80 per cent of the transplanted 
				trees are surviving. The irrigation for these trees will be 
				stopped during the current Khareef to see whether the trees 
				stabilise and take deep root, enough to survive without 
				irrigation. If they can survive until Khareef 2011, it can be 
				said they will survive for good. According to the forestry 
				standard worldwide, if the survival rate of transplanted trees 
				is above 30 per cent, the activity is considered successful.<br>
				<br>
				“In Dhofar, we can expect Khareef every year even though the 
				duration is just two month and a half maximum, but we can call 
				Khareef as a sustainable water resource that we can rely on 
				every year. We are using the water captured for re-vegetation 
				purposes,” says Shoji.</font></td>

				<br>
				AES Barka is committed to conserving the environment while 
				continuing to meet its goals of supplying clean and reliable 
				power and water to the people of Oman. It has embraced 
				environmental protection as one of the core values to conserve 
				the environment and strives to improve itself continuously in 
				conserving natural resources. The company strongly believes that 
				excellence in management of environment is an essential element 
				within its overall business.<br>
				<br>
				“AES Barka has implemented a number of initiatives for 
				protecting the environment taking note of the three R’s namely 
				re-using, recycling, and reduction/ optimisation of energy 
				consumption. Mitigating environmentally hazardous material usage 
				and taking part in environmental conservation programmes showing 
				that commitment is not limited to words, but it is being 
				converted to action for conservation of the environment where we 
				are living,” says Abdullah Al Nofli, Environment, Health and 
				Safety team leader, AES Barka.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Sustainable projects<br>
				</b>All the programmes, which AES Barka has initiated are 
				ongoing projects, which have a positive impact on the 
				environment. For instance, by the judicious use of power and 
				water, the company has reduced internal energy consumption 
				thereby helping to reduce power and steam generation ultimately 
				bringing down the consumption of natural gas and cutting down on 
				emissions. This has been done by plugging the leakage of steam 
				and water from steam traps, sampling points etc. All the online 
				and manual sampling points of water and steam, for instance, is 
				an area where a lot of water was lost if the flow rates were 
				kept at more than required. These sample points flow was 
				monitored in every shift and adjusted as per the requirements in 
				order to avoid wastage of water.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Plastic perils<br>
				</b>AES Barka believes that one of the major threats for the 
				next generation will be the health and environmental hazards of 
				plastic. Through its innovative plastic minimisation programme, 
				the company has been able to eliminate the environmental hazard 
				posed by around 3,600 PET bottles per month.<br>
				<br>
				“As an organisation, AES Barka is really concerned about the 
				increasing usage of plastic, which is going to pose multiple 
				hazards to the earth. Equally important is to conserve the 
				natural resources by optimising its consumption to ensure that 
				future generations are also able to enjoy the beauty of the 
				earth,” adds Al Nofli.<br>
				<br>
				Even in its core business of power generation, AES Barka has 
				taken care to install eco-friendly machinery. The gas turbines, 
				which generate power, are equipped with dry low NOx (DLN) burner 
				technology to control air emissions levels of NOx (nitrogen 
				oxide) which is harmful to human health.<br>
				<br>
				AES Barka consistently tries to improve its various other 
				efforts with the objective of conserving the environment. This 
				includes developing a green belt in the facility; and ensuring 
				that oil/ chemical usage or storage is not causing soil or 
				ground water contamination by providing storage areas with 
				non-permeable platform for secondary containment and spill 
				palettes to prevent soil contamination. </font></td>

				The goal of V-Kool Oman is to educate the public about climate 
				change and global warming and demonstrate how V-Kool film 
				installation on the glass of vehicles and buildings reduces the 
				CO2 emissions in the atmosphere.<br>
				<br>
				While educating the public about the increase of CO2 
				concentration in the atmosphere through green campaigns; V-Kool 
				also wants people to know about energy saving methods while 
				using electrical equipments and appliances.<br>
				<br>
				Explaining about the product, Alaa Jarrar, general manager, V-Kool 
				Oman, says, “By selectively rejecting solar heat, and reducing 
				air conditioning loads, V-Kool improves the fuel efficiency of a 
				car by 3 per cent, translating to a132 kg reduction in CO2 
				emissions <br>
				every year.”<br>
				<br>
				As for buildings where flat glass is used for windows etc, the 
				V-Kool film selectively rejects solar heat thereby reducing air 
				conditioning loads and saves 103.3 kwh/m2 of energy, translating 
				to 30.6 kg reduction in CO2 emissions every year.<br>
				V-Kool Oman also wants to increase the number of cars and flat 
				glass areas installed with V-Kool to reduce the emission of CO2 
				in the atmosphere.<br>
				<br>
				<b>CO2 reduction<br>
				</b>In Oman, V-Kool installs an average of 3200 cars with the 
				protective film, which means that vehicles using V-Kool 
				contribute to 422 tons of CO2 reduction per year at the rate of 
				132kg per car.<br>
				<br>
				Over 18 million cars worldwide are installed with V-Kool films. 
				This means that there is more than 2.3 million tonnes of CO2 
				reduction in the earth’s atmosphere.<br>
				<br>
				Meanwhile, the area of buildings coated until date with V-Kool 
				is about 4,64,684m2. This saves 48 million kwh of electricity, 
				thus reducing 14240 tonnes of CO2 emission. There is 30 per cent 
				annual increase in the number of cars installed by V-Kool, while 
				the area of glass fitted with V-Kool is also increasing yearly 
				by 20 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				With extensive green campaigns launched by V-Kool, many people 
				adapted the green concept in their lives and became fully aware 
				that it is the responsibility of every individual to implement 
				means that can lead to fuel and energy savings, which will in 
				turn reduce the danger of environment pollution. </font></td>

				Project Qudam is an Environmental Performance Improvement 
				initiative launched by Port of Salalah to make itself a “Green 
				Port” and achieve reduction of carbon emissions by 15 per cent 
				by December 2010 and a 25 per cent reduction by the end of 2014 
				with respect to the baseline year 2009.<br>
				<br>
				As a first step, the port began a structured approach of 
				identifying the sources of green house gases emission (GHG). Key 
				equipments and operations contributing to the significant 
				portion of GHG emissions were identified and potential 
				opportunities were identified to reduce/replace technology and 
				processes. Going forward, in 2010, independent expertise of 
				Ernst and Young was hired to further assess the carbon footprint 
				of the Port using internationally acknowledged best practices.<br>
				<br>
				“As we are a transshipment handling port, our major contribution 
				to the environment would be in energy consumption. Therefore, 
				our strategy comprised of ‘reduce’ and ‘replace’,” informs 
				Kutaiba Al Hatmy, corporate communications manager, Port of 
				Salalah.<br>
				Project Qudam environmental initiatives include reducing the 
				idle engine speed of the rolling terminal gantry (RTG) handling 
				the containers and modifying the air conditioner regulation of 
				quay cranes.<br>
				<br>
				Further, in order to save fossil fuel, the port installed shut 
				off system in the yard tractors; and reduced the waiting time of 
				tugboats for vessels. The port also installed auto switch off 
				system for floodlights of quay cranes; and planted trees around 
				the perimeter of the port compound.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Sustainable initiative<br>
				</b>Sustainability is the crux of Project Qudam. The initiatives 
				undertaken under this project have a payback of less than three 
				years, which ensures that these projects are implemented and 
				managed properly. These initiatives have been approved by the 
				top management of Port of Salalah.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from reduction in the carbon footprint of the port, these 
				initiatives also result in saving fossil fuel, which 
				contributes, to the GDP of the nation. The Port of Salalah is 
				also planning to take up a few of these projects under the Clean 
				Development Mechanism of United Nations Framework for Convention 
				on Climate Change (UNFCCC).<br>
				<br>
				The initiative to go green by Port of Salalah has drawn interest 
				from other ports in the region – considering the fact that Port 
				of Salalah is the first amongst the few in the world and the 
				first in Middle East to do so. In addition, the entire 
				initiative serves as an enormous source of awareness and 
				motivation for various stakeholders. For example, after the 
				launch of the Project Qudam, the employees of Port of Salalah 
				have taken the energy conservation attitude back to their home 
				and are implementing energy efficiency measures both at work and 
				at home. </font></td>

				For large corporate incumbents in the oil industry, making a 
				positive contribution to the environment does not always come 
				naturally. A major change in the company’s DNA is required not 
				to mention a commitment by management and shareholders alike to 
				put the planet before financial performance.<br>
				<br>
				But changing its corporate DNA is precisely what Petroleum 
				Development Oman (PDO) has done. And the result has been a 
				radical re-think of the way it consumes energy and how it can 
				mitigate the effect of its operations.<br>
				<br>
				PDO has been producing oil and gas for over 40 years and 
				operates over 120 oilfields throughout Oman. In order to 
				maintain oil production and secure Oman’s income for future 
				generations, PDO consumes a massive amount of electric power.<br>
				<br>
				To put this into perspective, PDO’s operations use as much 
				electricity as the whole of greater Muscat (population 1 
				million). Much of this power is used to pump water into 
				oilfields to maintain reservoir pressure and for enhanced oil 
				recovery.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Environmental achievement<br>
				</b>To meet its rapidly growing power requirements, PDO planned 
				to construct several new power stations. The goal was to ensure 
				that this could be achieved while reducing its carbon footprint. 
				As a direct result of its new planet-friendly mindset, PDO 
				scrapped plans to site plants where the power was required. 
				Instead, at a considerable extra cost, it chose to locate the 
				plants at oilfields where waste heat could be used to generate 
				steam for oilfield injection using an innovative process 
				hitherto unused in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				“From these power stations, PDO will generate steam using 
				exhaust heat that previously would have been wasted by direct 
				venting to the atmosphere. The temperature of these exhaust 
				gases is over 500 degrees celcius and can be used to make steam 
				– a process referred to as cogeneration,” explains Abdul-Amir Al 
				Ajmi, manager, Qarn Alam Cogeneration project.<br>
				<br>
				Three power plants linked to cogeneration units currently under 
				construction will save nearly 1 million tonnes of CO2/yr 
				compared to the traditional direct-firing approaches. A further 
				network of linked thermal EOR projects and power stations will 
				be constructed over the coming years. These projects will help 
				PDO realise a total emissions savings of over 4 million tonnes 
				of CO2/yr within five years.<br>
				<br>
				PDO recognises that what makes good environmental sense also 
				makes good business sense. It also shows that in addition to 
				protecting the planet by reducing the carbon footprint, there is 
				an eventual payback in terms of the reduced fuel requirement.&nbsp; </font></td>

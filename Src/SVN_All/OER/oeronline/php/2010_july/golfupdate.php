					Baker Finch went onto achieve great heights before he hit a

					</font>
					</b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					Ian Baker-Finch turned pro in 1979, and won the first of his 
					16 championships in 1983 at the New Zealand Open in 
					Auckland. His first major victory in Australia came at the 
					1987 Australian Matchplay Championship at Kingston Heath. 
					This was followed in 1988 by a stunning playoff win in the 
					Australian Masters where he knocked a five iron within a 
					metre of the cup on the first playoff hole to beat Craig 
					Parry and Roger Mackay. He has a host of Australasian PGA 
					Tour victories most notably the 1990 Coolum Classic, 1992 
					Vines Classic and the Open titles of Victoria, New South 
					Wales and Western Australia.<br>
					<br>
					Among his credits he has won tournaments on all four major 
					tours, including the 1989 Colonial Invitational (USA), the 
					1988 ASO Open (Japan), the 1985 Scandanavian Open, and the 
					1993 Australian PGA. But Baker-Finch’s moment of glory came 
					in 1991 when he won the British Open at Royal Birkdale Golf 
					Club. His final round 66 was one of the greatest ever in 
					major championship golf and included an outward nine of 29 
					where he birdied five of his first seven holes. His final 36 
					hole total (64-66) is the best ever by an Open Champion.<br>
					<br>
					</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Downhill drive <br>
					<img border="0" src="http://www.oeronline.com/images/Golf_New_Logo.jpg" width="100" height="247" vspace="4" hspace="9" align="right"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Baker-Finch 
					then famously suffered a complete collapse of his game. The 
					problems were often psychological, he would hit shots 
					flawlessly on the practice range, and then go to the first 
					tee and hit a weak drive into the wrong fairway. In the 1995 
					Open Championship at St Andrews, he notoriously hooked his 
					first round tee-shot at the first out-of-bounds on the left 
					side of the fairway shared with the 18th, with attention 
					focused on him as his playing partner was Arnold Palmer, 
					competing in his final Open. In 1995 and 1996 he missed the 
					cut, withdrew after one round, or was disqualified in all 
					twenty nine PGA Tour events that he entered. After shooting 
					a 92 in the first round of the 1997 British Open, an 
					extraordinarily bad score by tournament professional 
					standards, he withdrew from the championship and retired 
					from tournament golf.<br>
					<br>
					After his game deserted him, Baker-Finch turned his 
					interests to careers in broadcasting; and in golf course 
					design and management. He was hired by ABC Sports to 
					commentate on golf tournaments in 1998, and did so until 
					2006, when he was hired by CBS Sports. On broadcasts he is 
					often known by the nickname “Finchy”. Reporting for CBS at 
					the 2007 The Barclays tournament, Baker-Finch was one of the 
					thousands gathered around the 18th green as Rich Beem hit 
					his approach shot. The errant shot hit straight on 
					Baker-Finch’s cheek and knocked him out behind the green. 
					Baker-Finch recovered before Beem got to his ball.<br>
					<br>
					His course design work includes the impressive Golf Club at 
					Kennedy Bay regarded by some as Australia’s most authentic 
					links golf experience. He recently bought a share in The 
					Greg Norman designed Glades golf course on the Gold Coast 
					and will be managing the course with the help of Troon Golf. 
					In January 2008, he joined Gary Player Design as an 
					international brand ambassador and golf course designer.

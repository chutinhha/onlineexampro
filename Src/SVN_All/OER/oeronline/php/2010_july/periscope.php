					</font></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"> 
					<font face="Verdana" size="1">The onset of risk aversion has 
					a traumatic impact on crude oil prices. After trading in a 
					narrow $80-87 range for three months, crude oil prices lost 
					almost a fifth in May, falling as low as $70 before the risk 
					on trade that followed Chinaís stellar 50 per cent 
					year-on-year growth export data lifted the black gold to the 
					$74-76 range.<br>
					<br>
					Oilís brutal fall from grace vindicates the assertion of the 
					Saudi Petroleum Minister that stratospheric prices above $85 
					resulted from speculative funds that dominate the London and 
					New York futures exchange, where the marginal price of West 
					Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent market sweet crude is 
					daily set by the leveraged gladiators in the NYMEX and ICE 
					pits.<br>
					<br>
					So investorís psychology, Wall Streetís mood swings and the 
					economics of margin calls, not physical supply and demand 
					fundamentals, set the stage for the rampage of the oil 
					bears.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Broken quota discipline<br>
					</b>Yet, I would definitely caution against going long on 
					crude oil above $80. OPEC compliance to its supply cuts is a 
					mere 51 per cent, meaning quota discipline has broken down. 
					Iraq and Angola, let alone Russia and Mexico, have begun to 
					boost their production volumes. Summer seasonals argue 
					against higher oil and gas prices. Global spare capacity has 
					risen to six million barrels, mainly in Saudi Arabia and Ali 
					Naimi has ruled out any additional cuts in the Kingdomís 
					production at a time when Riyadh, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, 
					suffer most from the impact of OPEC quota violations.<br>
					<br>
					The IEA (International Energy Agency) has cut estimates of 
					global demand, US oil inventories are bloated and Chinese 
					industrial production data has softened. This means the next 
					wave of sovereign risk aversion could hit oil prices by 
					another $10-15 dollars, meaning it is entirely possible that 
					crude oil bottoms at $65 this summer.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Undervalued but attractive<br>
					</b>Saudi Arabia and Russia are the planetís two energy 
					superpowers. They are also two of the most undervalued 
					financial markets in the world. Two attractive petrocurrency 
					investment themes are Russian equities/sovereign debt and 
					Saudi Arabian (non-bank) shares, ideally when crude oil 
					trades in the $60-65 range.<br>
					<br>
					Russiaís return to the international capital markets since 
					the 1998 Yeltsin default is an event of seminal 
					significance. In late April, just as the market fireworks 
					began, the Kremlin raised $5.5bn in a dual tranche sovereign 
					Eurobond with five and ten year maturity. Finally, Russia 
					has a credible sovereign debt yield curve and a liquid, 
					benchmark new issue. I was amazed that the worldís smart 
					money investors bought Russian sovereign risk at a mere 125 
					points over US Treasury five years (135 basis points over 
					ten year Uncle Sam paper for the ten year tranche), 
					incredibly cheap pricing since the Russian Federationís 
					sovereign debt rating is a mere BBB.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Greek repercussion<br>
					</b>Naturally, the bonds sank in the secondary markets, 
					despite the best efforts of deal lead managers Barcap, Citi, 
					VTB Capital and Credit Suisse, though the Greek debacle 
					repriced emerging markets debt risk worldwide. Yet the 
					Russian Eurobond proves beyond a shadow of doubt that the 
					worldís perceptions of emerging markets risk has changed 
					beyond recognition in the last three months.<br>
					<br>
					We live in a world where Russian debt trades cheaper than 
					Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Irish government debt. 
					Meanwhile, Russian equities trade at a mere eight times 
					earnings, a huge discount to the Morgan Stanley emerging 
					markets indices at a time when GDP growth is accelerating, 
					$75bn of corporate debt has been refinanced, the rouble is 
					undervalued, the Kremlin has cracked down on corruption and 
					backed judicial reform, even promoted Moscow as a capital 
					markets hub. Russian debt has been rerated in the global 
					capital markets. Russian equities will be next.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Mauled market<br>
					</b>Saudi Arabiaís seven-year bull market was as long as it 
					was spectacular, with the Tadawul index rising sixfold to 
					21,000 by early 2006. However, the Saudi stock market has 
					been mauled by the grizzlies in the past month, trading in a 
					6000 ñ 7000 range. While oil prices have fallen, the 
					collapse of the Euro also means inflation rates will fall 
					even as private bank credit growth revives and the kingdomís 
					epic $400bn infrastructure spending programme boosts 
					economic growth. Saudi equities are reasonaﬂbly valued at 12 
					time earnings and twice book value, a fraction of bubble 
					valuations four years ago. Saudi Arabia is the worldís 
					largest oil producer, the OPEC central bank of black gold, 
					the largest consumer market and economy in the Middle East.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Comforting factors<br>
					</b>The Saudi population exceeds 25 million and boasts one 
					of the lowest median ages in the world. This means investors 
					in Saudi consumer shares face the most attractive secular 
					growth story in the Middle East ñ telecoms, insurance, 
					mortgages, consumer credit, and home appliances.<br>
					<br>
					King Abdullahís reforms, the six mega economic cities, a 
					surge in FDI, new multibillion dollar downstream petroleum 
					projects, the least leveraged banking system in the Gulf (a 
					mere 70 per cent loan-deposit ratio) are reasons why someone 
					should be bullish about Saudi Arabia. Further, the worldís 
					lowest cost oil reserves, the opening of local capital 
					markets to foreign investors are some of the other reasons I 
					am bullish about Saudi Arabian equities in the next two 
					years.<br>
					<br>
					In fact, I believe the Tadawul index could well rise to 
					10,000 in the next two years, still half its bubble peak in 
					2006. The Tadawul is a buy anywhere in the 6000 ñ 6300 
					range. </font></p>

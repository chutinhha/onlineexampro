            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">The political and economic 
            uncertainties in the global markets following the recent war in Iraq 
            are being discussed, analysed, picked apart and put back again 
            innumerable times. No one denies the fact that the repercussions of 
            the war are bound to be felt for a long time to come - not just by 
            Iraq, but by the rest of the Middle East region and, ultimately, the 
            world. Nevertheless, post war, we see major players in the region 
            waking up to the realisation that they can play a part in Iraq's 
            reconstruction, after all. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">&quot;To begin speculating on the 
            outcome of events is quite an ambitious task. Historically, any war 
            creates countless new opportunities and destroys many others. Of 
            course, there will be lots of lucrative opportunities in terms of 
            trade and investment,&quot; says Iraqi-born analyst Shwan Taha of 
            Templeton Investment (Turkey). <br>
            &quot;You can expect that, during any war, things would slow down. But 
            after the situation is resolved in Iraq, I predict there will be 
            more technology-oriented investment in the region in Iraq. Look at 
            Afghanistan. Immediately after their war ended, there was a flood of 
            investment in the country. Iraq has its own revenue base, so we'll 
            see a faster build-up of infrastructure and investment there. The 
            nations around Iraq will be key suppliers of technology. It could 
            create a boom in the region,&quot; echoes Ennis Rimawi of Jordan-based 
            Estarta Solutions, a US-led IT consulting firm. <br>
            <b><br>
            Iraq's strengths<br>
            </b>Iraq is a nation steeped in a rich and diverse culture and is 
            home to a resilient and resourceful people. However, Iraq's 
            inhabitants have gone through tumultuous times during the last two 
            decades. They have witnessed the soul-destroying decimation of their 
            local infrastructure and local economy. <br>
            Despite this, Iraq has the potential to play a significant role in 
            the prosperity of the Middle East given that the necessary level of 
            reconstruction goes ahead and other political challenges are 
            overcome. After all, Iraq has its own resources to help it on its 
            way to economic recovery. <br>
            Besides the supply of humanitarian support and restoration of basic 
            services, which, admittedly from international aid bodies is still 
            to gain a satisfactory level of momentum mostly because Iraq is 
            still somewhat gripped by widespread instability and social unease, 
            it is possible that efforts to reconstruct the country could create 
            a windfall of business opportunities for the Gulf. <br>
            Although US companies and possibly some European ones seem most 
            likely to secure lucrative deals for the redevelopment of Iraq's 
            infrastructure, there is little doubt that many trade and investment 
            opportunities will filter through to regional economies too, not 
            least the Sultanate. &quot;There are definitely huge opportunities for 
            the companies in the region even if the larger contracts are taken 
            by companies from the Western world because it would not make 
            business sense for those companies to do everything themselves. 
            There will be massive sub-contracting jobs for the local companies 
            because of their proximity,&quot; explains T.V.A. Raja, Deputy General 
            Manager (Banking Services &amp; Operations), BankMuscat. <br>
            &quot;Many of Oman's natives can trace their ancestral roots back to Iraq 
            and a very deep relationship has always existed between the two 
            nations. This gives Omanis a distinct advantage in the long term 
            should they decide to take a closer look at business prospects 
            there,&quot; adds Dr Nazar Younis, an Iraqi-born lecturer in commerce and 
            economics at Sultan Qaboos University. Moreover, there is evidence 
            that the historic relationship between the two nations is two-sided 
            and there is good reason to preclude that this traditional 
            bilateralism will continue to also benefit Iraqis.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Casting the net</b><br>
            Jordan is already re-exporting small quantities of Omani goods to 
            Iraq. N. Kumar, marketing manager for Oman Fisheries Co. (OFC) SAOG, 
            says, &quot;We sell fish directly to Jordan and have obtained feedback 
            from our clients that they are trying to sell some volume of fish to 
            Iraq.&quot; Although the exact quantity of Omani fish reaching Iraq's 
            market is unknown, Kumar notes that Jordan is a significant export 
            market for the company with around five per cent of the total fish 
            landed by OFC being supplied to that destination alone. OFC lands 
            about 12,000 tonnes of fish each year.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Successful entry <br>
            </b>When it comes to forecasting which local companies stand a 
            healthier chance of securing trade deals in Iraq, Younis emphasises 
            those firms that are large, well established and well organised. For 
            instance, an Omani company that has already begun to establish a 
            foothold in the Iraqi market is Oman National Dairy Products (ONDP), 
            reveals Murthada Ahmed Sultan, a director of the WJ Towell Group. 
            &quot;Iraq is already very important to us,&quot; says Sultan. He expects that 
            more business will be brought to the company as trade to Iraq 
            becomes easier and the lifting of economic sanctions endorsed by the 
            UN Security Council takes effect. <br>
            The company registered in Qatar and Kuwait before many others - 
            something that has certainly given it an edge over other competitors 
            in the region. Prior to the war, ONDP had signed contracts that have 
            today been honoured while many new orders have been made by the US 
            and UN-agencies in Iraq. In fact, a number of Oman's factories are 
            currently working round-the-clock to meet the new demand from the 
            Iraqi market. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Business bonanza <br>
            </b>&quot;You receive all the information you need: the order, payment 
            terms and the contact for delivery. But you must ensure that the 
            goods are received safely by the right parties and that delivery 
            notes are signed-off correctly,&quot; maintains Sultan. &quot;There isn't a 
            problem with payment as we are dealing directly with US 
            organisations or UN-appointed agencies,&quot; he adds. <br>
            &quot;The Iraqis may just be looking around for partners capable of 
            handling big reconstruction projects, and any information available 
            directly on their desks will be of great help to them,&quot; claims Raja.<br>
            &quot;If Omani companies act in time, there will be no hesitation on the 
            part of Iraqis to dole out good projects to them. Now is the time 
            when Omani businesses should form a high-level delegation of 
            companies involved in infrastructure development and go and meet the 
            people that matter in Iraq to try and bag contracts there. In fact, 
            I am confident that every big company worth its salt is, right now, 
            eyeing that opportunity and is getting into an aggressive marketing 
            mode,&quot; he adds. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Reconstruction plans <br>
            </b>Iraq's economy and infrastructure have been devastated by years 
            of war, economic mismanagement and sanctions. At the time of going 
            to press, economic sanctions have been lifted and it is reported 
            that oil production is to resume soon. The new administration is 
            expected to focus on re-construction with emphasis on improving the 
            country's infrastructure. The areas that will need significant 
            investments are oil, water and electricity utilities, road and rail 
            networks, bridges, schools and hospitals among others. <br>
            It has been estimated that the costs of post-war reconstruction 
            would be in the range of between US$50-100 billion (RO19.23-38.46 
            billion). This is likely to be financed by way of donations and aid 
            from other countries, financial assistance from the World Bank and 
            other multilateral development agencies and by oil revenues. Other 
            potential sources of capital are the Arab governments, companies and 
            banks sympathetic to the plight of Iraq, multinationals and existing 
            domestic savings, according to Kuwait-based Global Investment House 
            (GIH). <br>
            Also, during the 1970s, small-scale factories that produced 
            plastics, machine parts and household appliances grew to a 
            significant level in Iraq. Most of these industries declined during 
            the Gulf War and machinery that fell into disrepair was left for 
            broken. Furthermore, the embargo prohibited the import of almost any 
            kind of heavy machinery. Only spare parts were allowed. And even if 
            Iraq managed to bypass the UN, it would not have enough means to pay 
            for them, as it did not have enough foreign currency. <br>
            &quot;There's an opportunity to revive these factories as well as Iraqi 
            cement plants with fairly moderate levels of investment. Labour 
            intensive industries such as traditional spinning and weaving of 
            fabrics could also be reinstated,&quot; say Younis. <br>
            The industrial sector in Iraq has faced enormous difficulties. 
            Access to raw material and intermediate material was assured by 
            income from the oil industry. But with the embargo, Iraq could not 
            import these materials anymore. Seventy per cent of the industrial 
            sector was practically paralysed before the recent war in Iraq.<br>
            It has been reported that KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton Company, 
            has been awarded the contract to fight oil fires in Iraq and develop 
            plans to restore Iraq's oil infrastructure. It is estimated that 
            this contract could be worth as much as US$7 billion (RO2.70 
            billion) over two years.<br>
            The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is one of the 
            largest agencies awarding development contracts in Iraq. As per the 
            US federal law, the primary contracts funded by USAID have to be 
            awarded only to US companies. However, approval has been granted for 
            non-US companies to be awarded sub-contracts. The nine key areas in 
            which contracts have been or are to be awarded are seaport 
            administration, airport administration, capital construction, public 
            health, personnel support, theatre logistical support, primary and 
            secondary education, local governance and Iraq community action 
            programme. <br>
            There are also going to be good opportunities for companies that 
            specialise in labour services, housing and logistical support. &quot;I 
            would expect there to be a need for an influx of cheap, semi-skilled 
            foreign labourers to handle many construction tasks. Those companies 
            with proven experience in creating and managing labour housing, 
            training and recruitment could establish business in Iraq,&quot; suggests 
            Younis.<br>
            Moreover, there are tremendous re-export opportunities available for 
            companies in Oman. &quot;With the euro appreciating by about 20-25 per 
            cent in value during the past year, European products have become 
            almost prohibitively expensive. That leaves the Iraqis with either 
            products from the US or from the Gulf. Re-export, thus, is a major 
            opportunity, and that area is worth exploring for anyone,&quot; says 
            Tawfeeq A.Al-Lawati, Chairman, Ahlia Detergent Co. SAOG.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Uncertainty reigns <br>
            </b>The main concern for companies doing business in Iraq is the 
            socio-political uncertainty that still exists and the related 
            volatile market environment. Actual unemployment was perhaps as high 
            as 50 per cent of the working population in 2002. Signs of 
            impoverishment are widespread. Iraq is a heavily indebted country 
            and will need to find ways of restructuring its loans. According to 
            the World Bank's 2001 estimates, Iraq's total debt was around 
            US$127.7 billion (RO49.11 billion). Iraq's financial obligations are 
            compounded by pending contracts of around US$57 billion (RO21.92 
            billion) primarily in energy and telecommunications sectors, the 
            bulk of which (US$52 billion) are signed with Russian entities. This 
            is a perilous reminder of how much support Iraq is in need of. 
            Moreover, the security situation in Iraq remains dangerous and fluid 
            and the opportunity for business development remains hampered by 
            this. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Diplomacy between Iraq and Oman<br>
            </b>In the past, the Sultanate has acted as an important 
            intermediary at times of crises. As evidence of this, His Majesty 
            Sultan Qaboos was given the International Peace Award in 1998. <br>
            In fact, Oman has prided itself on having established relations with 
            135 countries (1999) and having never broken off diplomatic ties 
            with any of these. The Sultanate also played a significant role in 
            convincing the Security Council to double the 
            oil-for-food-and-medicine package to reduce the suffering of the 
            Iraqi people in 2000. <br>
            &quot;Oman has a stable foreign policy, which has been admired by many 
            foreigners, be it Arabs or others. Put simply, our foreign policy is 
            basically one of non-interference, and we expect to have strong 
            diplomatic relations with Iraq,&quot; says Al-Lawati.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Regional economies<br>
            </b>&quot;Iraq is neighboured by other countries with good industries and 
            resources which would have advantage over Oman in terms of their 
            proximity, costs and the size of economies and, thus, will be more 
            competitive,&quot; says Al-Lawati. <br>
            &quot;There are countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Turkey and 
            Jordan, which may have more advanced and diversified industry. 
            Moreover, there is still some risk element associated with 
            conducting business in Iraq. There are trading companies in these 
            countries that may be willing to undertake that risk whereas the 
            industry in Oman tends to be more risk-averse.&quot; <br>
            Younis of SQU agrees, saying, &quot;One would expect the UAE to play a 
            major role as a transportation and financial centre. Kuwait could 
            also be another important hub for bringing in cranes and bulky 
            mechanical items.&quot; Although the major contracts may be US-led, the 
            region will inevitably contribute towards the logistics of goods and 
            services. Furthermore, exports to Iraq have traditionally taken a 
            route through Jordan, Egypt, Syria or Lebanon. </font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <b>Kuwait's role<br>
            </b>Given its proximity to Iraq and the fact that it has one of the 
            largest sea and airports in the region, Kuwait can benefit 
            substantially from the reconstruction of Iraq. Increased flow of 
            goods and people to Iraq will help boost the Kuwaiti economy, 
            reports GIH. The construction sector along with allied industries 
            such as cement, steel and construction materials are likely to 
            witness significant growth in demand. Kuwaiti oil services companies 
            are likely to benefit from the large investments expected in the 
            Iraqi oil sector. The travel and tourism industry is also expected 
            to witness higher demand due to the increase in the number of 
            business travellers. Other segments of the economy are also expected 
            to benefit from the increase in demand for consumer goods and other 
            services in Iraq.<br>
            &quot;The Kuwaiti markets are already booming on expectations of local 
            companies bagging large projects in Iraq because of its geographical 
            proximity to Iraq,&quot; avers Raja of BankMuscat. The equity prices in 
            the Kuwaiti stock market have already begun to reflect this 
            buoyancy. In fact, the market capitalisation of Kuwait Stock 
            Exchange is 126 per cent of the country's GDP compared with 
            Bahrain's 83 per cent and Saudi Arabia's 56 per cent. Muscat Stock 
            Market's market capitalisation, by contrast, stands at 13 per cent 
            of Oman's GDP. <br>
            Some of the key areas where Kuwaiti companies are likely to get 
            preference for sub-contracting owing to their expertise include 
            construction, sewage treatment, water desalination, trade, 
            contracting and communications technology. <br>
            Media reports have indicated that smaller firms in countries that 
            relied upon Iraq as a major export destination could be squeezed 
            out, forcing them to find new markets to sell their products and 
            services. For example, trade between Lebanon and Iraq ground to a 
            halt in the lead-up to the recent war in Iraq, and some major 
            Lebanese firms supplied as much as half of their exports to this 
            maket alone. The other countries that fear that many of their 
            lucrative oil and power contracts may have disappeared along with 
            the Saddam Hussein regime include Russia, France, Switzerland and 
            China.<br>
            Of course, it is questionable whether companies in the region could 
            handle some of the high-value reconstruction projects, but the fact 
            that the large Western companies that bag these projects will need 
            regional sub-contractors will at least benefit the Gulf-based 
            companies aiming to get a chunk of the post-war pie. <br>

					<b><br>
                    As the financial crisis fades and the banking sector faces 
					less headwinds, it’s a good time to do a status check on the 
					way fortunes of individual banks have been impacted by the 
					crisis. This year’s OER-GBCM survey throws up interesting 
					insights about the sectors compulsions, performance and 
					future direction. <br>
                    </b><br>
					Oman’s financial system is dominated by banks which account 
					for more than 90 percent of total assets and liabilities of 
					the financial sector as a whole. At the end of 2009, the 
					Omani banking system consisted of 17 commercial banks, of 
					which seven are locally incorporated and ten are branches of 
					foreign banks. In addition, there are two specialised banks 
					operating in the country, one catering to development of 
					projects and the other providing mortgage loans. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Calibrated growth</b><br>
					In Oman, the banking industry has been witnessing 
					significant growth in recent years, mainly due to sustained 
					increase in oil prices, efforts to diversify the economy, 
					implementation of large industrial, real estate and 
					infrastructure projects and growing emphasis on the private 
					sector. Total assets of the commercial banks, which were 
					4.9bn rials at the end of 2004, rose to 14.2bn rials at the 
					end of 2009, indicating an annual average growth of about 38 
					per cent during the last five years. Bank credit constituted 
					bulk of the banks’ assets which remained by and large stable 
					in the range of 65-70 per cent of the total assets. Despite 
					increase in the size of balance sheets, there has been a 
					steady decline in the gross non-performing loans as 
					percentage of the total assets fell from nearly 10 per cent 
					in 2004 to 2.1 per cent in 2008, before rising marginally in 
					2009 due to cyclical downturn of the economy. System-wise 
					capital adequacy ratio for commercial banks as percentage of 
					otal risk weighted assets also remained at a satisfactory 
					level of around 15 per cent during the same period as 
					against the minimum regulatory requirement of 10 per cent.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Strong framework</b><br>
					Despite knock-on effects on the banking sector from the 
					recent global financial crisis, Oman’s banking system 
					remained sound, resilient and profitable due to appropriate 
					regulatory and supervisory policy adopted by the CBO. The 
					emphasis on financial stability by the CBO has been 
					reflected in fine tuning of regulatory and supervisory norms 
					for banks from time-to-time in line with the international 
					codes and best practices. In pursuance of its commitment to 
					adopt global best practices in banking regulation and 
					supervision, the CBO was in the forefront to mandate 
					implementation of Basel II capital adequacy framework since 
					January 2007. <br>
					<br>
					The minimum capital requirement for new local banks was 
					raised from 50mn rials to 100mn rials and for foreign banks 
					from 10mn rials to 20mn rials. The CBO’s prescription of 
					general provisions of one percent on the performing 
					non-personal loans and two percent on performing personal 
					loans, introduced in 2004, has proved to be extremely useful 
					in providing much needed cushion for Omani banks to meet the 
					challenges of the global economic crisis. <br>
					<br>
					The banking industry around the world has been passing 
					through a critical phase since 2008. In 2009, most of the 
					banks and financial institutions, particularly in the 
					western countries, were busy in repairing their balance 
					sheets, infusing capital, and recovering from the state of 
					credit crunch. Despite adverse international developments, 
					Omani banks earned profits of 198.4mn rials (provisional) in 
					2009 as against 234.1mn rials in the previous year. Despite 
					slowdown of both deposit and credit growth, Omani banks were 
					in a better position to consolidate their business in 2009 
					compared to their counterparts in the region.

				banking industry worldwide got severely impacted by the global 
				financial crisis? How has Oman’s banking sector faced this 
				challenge?<br>
				</b></font><font color="#333333">The international financial 
				crisis had been a global concern, and countries with strong 
				fundamentals and sound financial systems have also been affected 
				by the concerns and uncertainties being transmitted from the 
				markets of the developed countries. Oman’s banking system had no 
				direct exposure to any of the toxic financial products and any 
				of the distressed international institutions, and in that sense, 
				they remained insulated from the direct adverse ramifications of 
				the global financial crisis. <br>
				<br>
				The Central Bank of Oman (CBO), nevertheless, recognised that 
				the global financial crisis, and its manifestation in the form 
				of a severe global credit squeeze, may have some indirect 
				effects on the liquidity and credit conditions in Oman’s banking 
				system for a brief period at the beginning of the crisis, which 
				the CBO had responded proactively with appropriate liquidity 
				enhancing policy measures. The CBO amended the reserve 
				requirement regulation reducing the reserve ratio from eight per 
				cent to five per cent of deposit liabilities effective December 
				2008, thus ensuring more structural liquidity in the banking 
				system. The lending ratio regulation was eased to 87.5 per cent 
				from 85 percent to avoid any immediate credit contraction due to 
				any regulatory constraint. <br>
				<br>
				Further, concerned about any possible tightening of access to US 
				dollar liquidity in the international markets, and the 
				associated concerns about rollover of short-term US dollar 
				liabilities and financing of project loans already committed in 
				USD, the CBO in consultation with the government offered access 
				to USD liquidity of upto $2bn to the local banks. Usage of this 
				facility has remained very modest and currently outstanding 
				figures reveal borrowings of around $100mn only. These measures 
				along with a strong regulatory framework was able to provide 
				needed stability and confidence to the Sultanate’s financial 
				sector, particularly at the height of the global financial 
				uncertainty.</font><font color="#808080"> <br>
				</font><br>
				<font color="#3778FF"><b>CBO has been a proponent of a strong 
				and effective regulatory regime. Did this approach help banks to 
				stand up to the crisis better?<br>
				</b></font><font color="#333333">The main challenge for the 
				banking sector in Oman, like in many other countries is to 
				continuously remain vigilant with respect to potential systemic 
				weaknesses and address them in a timely and correct manner. From 
				the CBO’s perspective, addressing issues such as contagion could 
				be in the form of policy adjustments and strengthening of the 
				regulatory framework. On the banking supervision front, CBO has 
				been strong proponent of a strong and effective regulatory 
				regime with the objective of strengthening the banking sector 
				without compromising its efficiency and ability to innovate and 
				spur economic growth. As a matter of fact, Oman’s banking system 
				was relatively less affected by the recent international 
				financial crisis as we were not into the business of complex 
				derivative products. <br>
				</font><br>
				<font color="#3778FF"><b>CBO has been promoting the idea of a 
				financial supervisory framework that includes risk based 
				supervision. What does this idea stand for and in what ways will 
				this help banks?<br>
				</b></font><font color="#333333">The current supervisory 
				approach of CBO is largely driven by on-site examination and is 
				supplemented by off-site monitoring. The on-site examination 
				process is based on the CAMEL approach, where capital adequacy, 
				asset quality, management aspects, Earnings, and liquidity of 
				supervised entities (ie banks, FLCs and MECs) are examined 
				keeping in view the requirement of provisions of the Banking Law 
				of 2000 and Regulations issued thereunder. It is argued that the 
				current supervisory process, which is a ‘one-size-fits-all’ 
				approach, is not necessarily tailored to the risk profile of a 
				supervised entity. Therefore, in order to respond positively to 
				the developments in the domain of banking regulation and 
				supervision as also the global trends, CBO has decided to move 
				over to ‘Risk-based and Consolidated Supervisory’ (RBS) regime.<br>
				<br>
				The RBS approach is intended to result in an effective and 
				efficient process for monitoring and assessing, on an on-going 
				basis, the safety and soundness of supervised entities. The RBS 
				approach entails focusing and dedicating supervisory resources 
				to identify activities and practices of greater risk to the 
				soundness of supervised entities, and also to identify 
				higher-risk institutions. Once those activities and institutions 
				have been identified, supervisory attention is turned to 
				assessing and measuring those risks, including examining how the 
				risks are mitigated. This approach makes it possible to more 
				efficiently deploy supervisory resources, whether staff, 
				financial or technical, to address the identified risks. <br>
				<br>
				Under the RBS approach, it is necessary that risk profiles of 
				all supervised entities are prepared, maintained and updated on 
				a continuous basis. The intensity of supervision and the extent 
				and focus of supervisory action will depend on the perceived 
				risk profile of a supervised entity. <br>
				</font><br>
				<font color="#3778FF"><b>How has the banking sector performed in 
				terms of assets growth, profit levels, capital adequacy ratios 
				in 2009?<br>
				</b></font><font color="#333333">The banking sector in Oman 
				continued its growth during 2009 as it witnessed increase in all 
				major banking aggregates despite the deceleration reflecting the 
				cyclical downturn of the economy. Provisional figures of 
				commercial banks showed a modest growth in total assets of 2.9 
				per cent to 14.2bn rials in December 2009 compared to 13.8bn 
				rials in December 2008. <br>
				<br>
				Total outstanding credit rose by 6.2 percent to 9.8bn rials at 
				the end of December 2009 from 9.25bn rials at the end of 
				December 2008. Aggregate deposits also registered a growth of 
				six per cent from 8.6bn rials to 9.1bn rials. Provisional net 
				profits of commercial banks stood slightly lower at 190.8mn 
				rials in 2009 compared to 234.1mn rials in the previous year. 
				The capital adequacy ratio of banks stood higher at 15.4 per 
				cent in September 2009 as against 14.7 per cent at the end of 
				December 2008. <br>
				</font><br>
				<font color="#3778FF"><b>Is the CBO going to increase interest 
				rates in 2010 or will it continue to remain at the same level?<br>
				</b></font><font color="#333333">Interest rates are deregulated 
				in Oman (other than for personal loans) and its level is 
				determined by market forces. Interest rates charged by banks are 
				determined based on many factors such as cost of funds 
				(including equity), risk premium, operating costs, extent of 
				collaterals etc. <br>
				</font><br>
				<font color="#3778FF"><b>What is the CBO’s stand on de-pegging 
				the Omani Rial from the US dollar?<br>
				</b></font><font color="#333333">The CBO remains firmly 
				committed to the fixed peg, and our assessment has been that 
				despite the concerns arising from imported inflation, the 
				benefits of the fixed peg are substantial, given our economic 
				structure and high degree of openness in both current and 
				capital accounts. The fixed peg provides the country with a 
				stable exchange rate which helps in promoting investment, growth 
				and diversification of the economy. <br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font color="#3778FF">As oil prices go up, the threat 
				of inflation looms around the corner. Is the CBO working on 
				measures to deal with inflation?<br>
				</font></b><font color="#333333">As of now, the international 
				oil prices seems to have stabilised between $70 and $80 per 
				barrel. The recovery of the western countries appears to be 
				fragile. The global demand for oil may not shoot up unless 
				recovery gathers momentum in the major western countries. The 
				upside risks to inflation in most of the western countries are 
				modest as output gap remains negative. There is no immediate 
				threat to inflation from abroad. So far as domestic demand is 
				concerned, it is conditioned by contraction of nominal GDP which 
				has declined by 27.4 per cent upto the third quarter of 2009. 
				The average inflation decelerated to 3.4 per cent in 2009 
				compared to 12.4 per cent in the previous year. <br>
				<br>
				The CBO is keeping a vigil over the price situation in Oman. If 
				upside risks to inflation accelerate, appropriate monetary 
				measures will be taken going ahead. As of now, restoring growth 
				to the pre-crisis level is considered more important vis-à-vis 
				the inflationary pressure in the economy.</font></font></td>

				We have taken growth and sustainability parameters for ranking 
				of commercial banks in Oman. The ranking was done among the 
				leading banks which include BankMuscat, National Bank of Oman, 
				Oman Arab Bank, BankDhofar, and Oman International Bank. We have 
				taken the period from 2006 to 2009 to rank them on the set 
				parameters for growth and sustainability. Ahli Bank has seen a 
				transition from housing bank to commercial bank during this 
				period because of which we have excluded the bank in our 
				ranking. For now, the newly established Bank Sohar also has been 
				excluded.<br>
				<br>
				The data was sourced from the published financial statements of 
				the banks, CBO reports and other published reports. Ranking 
				based on growth is done by calculating the CAGR growth of gross 
				loans, customer deposits, fee income, operating profit, networth 
				and net profit during the period from 2006 to 2009. Ranking for 
				sustainability was done by calculating the four year average of 
				three key factors like asset quality, productivity and 
				efficiency. <br>
				<br>
				Asset quality was ranked based on non performing assets to the 
				gross loan (NPA/GL) ratio and the overall loan provisions to non 
				performing assets (provision coverage ratio). Productivity is 
				ranked based on operating profit of the bank to its number of 
				branches and number of employees. Efficiency considers net 
				interest margins (net interest income/average interest bearing 
				assets), cost to income ratio, return on average assets and 
				return on average equity. For the calculation of cost to income 
				ratio, we have excluded the depreciation expenses. </font></td>

				<br>
				<b>Despite the global financial unrest during the last year 
				BankDhofar continued to achieve good results throughout 2009. 
				The total assets of the bank reached 1,486.9mn rials as compared 
				to 1,323.8mn rials at the end of 2008, signifying a sustained 
				growth of 12.32 per cent. The net loans and advances to 
				customers stood at 1,194.2mn rials compared to 1,018.4mn rials 
				in 2008 reflecting a growth of 17.26 per cent. Says Kris 
				Babicci, CEO, BankDhofar, “Although the region is yet to fully 
				come out of the global economic crisis, BankDhofar managed 
				reasonably well in all key areas, posting good growth rates. We 
				continued to enhance our positioning due to a focused business 
				strategy.” <br>
				<br>
				Being prepared<br>
				</b>Anticipating an adverse economic environment the bank held 
				onto the basics coupled with strict risk management practices. 
				The bank’s approach to the challenges thrown up by the financial 
				crisis was to take stock and consolidate its position in order 
				to reduce the adverse effects of any potential fallout. 
				Specifically, it took pro-active steps to critically monitor 
				assets in the vulnerable sectors such as real estate, share 
				lending and commodities, for any alert signs and to take 
				remedial action. This has helped the bank to an extent in 
				minimising its NPA levels and consequent provisions. <br>
				<br>
				It also reworked its strategy of lending to these sectors 
				through adoption of stricter lending criteria, continuous 
				monitoring and selective financing. The amount of additional 
				provisions for impaired loans made in 2009 was 11.7mn rials and 
				the recovery from provisions was 1.5mn rials.<br>
				<br>
				The bank’s consumer banking division (CBD) continued its focus 
				on providing value-added products and services to customers. The 
				bank continued its growth and expansion strategy, strengthening 
				its distribution channels with the addition of more branches, 
				ATMs and deposit and bill payment machines (DBPMs). There was an 
				addition of three new branches at Quriyat, Jalan Bani Bu Hassan 
				and Raysut, a relocation of two branches – Al Amirat and 
				Al-Buraimi and renovation of four branches in Sur, Seeb Airport, 
				Saada and Salalah main branch. Twelve new ATMs were installed 
				(10 offsite ATMs) and eight Deposit and Bill Payment Machines 
				(DBPMs). The year ended with 54 branches, 98 ATMs and 30 DBPMs.
				<br>
				<br>
				Although banks were amidst a global financial crisis, 2009 
				witnessed sensible growth of BankDhofar’s flagship Al Heson 
				savings scheme offering competitive prizes to its customers. The 
				Al Heson savings scheme is a popular savings schemes in the 
				market with a unique proposition; it gives customers the 
				opportunity to open an account, save and the chance to win 
				prizes every week. In 2009 its consumer assets grew by 120.5mn 
				rials (28 per cent), growing the book to 544mn rials and the 
				savings base grew by 18.5mn rials. Says Babicci, “Our plan is to 
				build up on the consumer banking balance sheet growth and set 
				grounds for a stronger base for building a strategy that will 
				enable the bank to be the best retail bank in the years to 
				come.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Financing business needs <br>
				</b>Against the backdrop of a rapidly changing economic profile 
				of the country and increased competition in the banking sector, 
				the wholesale banking group is spearheading the future growth 
				for the bank. It’s objective is to be the ‘bank of first choice’ 
				for corporate customers in Oman and cater to all their banking 
				requirements and services. The bank wants to focus on different 
				segments of businesses and to provide a full range of commercial 
				and corporate banking services under a single umbrella. The SME 
				sector in Oman is relatively young as compared to similar 
				markets. Considering the opportunities available in this segment 
				the bank has initiated focused efforts to increase its share in 
				funding of SMEs. The government’s emphasis on employment 
				generation is also a positive development for the SMEs in Oman.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				“BankDhofar has been in the forefront in the financing of large 
				infrastructural projects of national importance and has a 
				sizable exposure to this sector. Due to the financial crisis and 
				the drying up of liquidity in US dollar funds last year, there 
				was a slowdown in project related lending. Despite this we have 
				been able to maintain moderate growth in this niche area. Going 
				forward we see great potential in this segment on account of the 
				ambitious plans of the government in the conventional sectors – 
				oil and gas, power, roads and also in the emerging sectors such 
				as tourism,” says Babicci. <br>
				<br>
				Over the years the Bank has participated in almost all major 
				infrastructural projects including the projects of Oman India 
				Fertiliser Company, Sohar Aluminum, Oman LNG, Oman Gas, Salalah 
				Port, Oman Refinery (expansion), Octal Petrochemicals and six 
				power and water projects.<br>
				<br>
				The year 2009 has been a remarkable year for the human resources 
				division (HRD) of the bank on account of the significant 
				contribution made in promoting the image of the bank in the 
				country. The active participation of the HRD in career fairs 
				that were held at colleges and universities in Oman helped to 
				increase the bank’s awareness and visibility. A pro-active 
				approach was made to increase retention rates, which is clearly 
				reflected in the decrease of registered resignations from 11 per 
				cent in 2008 to only four per cent in 2009. The total strength 
				of the bank in 2009 grew to 956 in comparison to 848 in 2008.<br>
				<br>
				Looking ahead Babicci says, “The year 2010 will be a year of 
				consolidation for the industry and will lay the foundation for a 
				paradigm shift in the approach to risk evaluation and 
				determining capital needs. Therefore our approach to business 
				would be to strengthen internal controls and practices in line 
				with the developing trends and to take a cautious stance towards 
				business growth. The focus will be on developing a quality 
				lending portfolio rather than on aggressive growth.” The bank 
				plans to focus on providing better service for retail customers 
				by diversification and expansion of delivery channels. It has 
				plans of opening up six new branches, adding 26 ATMs and 18 
				CDM’s this year. In addition it will launch dedicated Priority 
				Banking Centers within the capital area and the Dhofar region to 
				provide privilege services to its customers.<br>
				<br>
				In 2009 BankDhofar entered its second year of implementation of 
				the five year strategy laid down by the Bank with the assistance 
				of Booze Allen Hamilton and going by the numbers the move seems 
				to have paid off in good measure. The past year witnessed a 
				struggle in the financial world, and yet, reflecting on 2009, 
				BankDhofar has seen accomplishments that represent resilience, 
				determination and drive; and the bank has emerged stronger 
				within the local financial market. The bank not only intends to 
				repeat its success, but to reach even further, in its vision to 
				become the bank to do business within Oman. <br>

				sticking to the fundamentals of banking, Oman Arab Bank has been 
				able to balance its books strongly and yield excellent dividends 
				to its shareholders</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				<b>Oman Arab Bank (OAB), which is celebrating its 25th 
				anniversary, has reported a good performance for 2009 even 
				though its profits were lower by six per cent as compared to 
				2008, mainly due to lower recoveries from impaired loans but the 
				operating profit at 28mn rials was higher than 26.45mn rials for 
				2008.<br>
				</b><br>
				As the banking subsidiary of the Ominvest Group, OAB operates 
				within the confines of the Omani economy and growth in the 
				bank’s loan book and resultant earnings is dependent on the 
				continuous growth in Oman’s economic activities.<br>
				<br>
				OAB has been the biggest participator and contributor to Oman’s 
				economic growth through its main activities, which include 
				project financing, commercial banking, investment banking and 
				consumer financing.<br>
				<br>
				Practically every flyover built in the Sultanate has been 
				project-financed by the bank. Not only that, in Sohar, the boom 
				town of Oman, almost 95 per cent of all the big-ticket projects 
				contributing to the massive industrialisation have been funded 
				by the bank.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Conservative growth<br>
				</b>OAB takes pride in its conservative approach to lending 
				because that has helped the bank to come out unscathed from the 
				toxic financial crisis of the past year. Says Abdul Kader 
				Askalan, CEO, OAB, “Previously those who complained about our 
				conservative approach are now lauding our operating model. We 
				are the only bank in Oman which has been giving dividend 
				year-after-year to its shareholders.” During 2009, a cash 
				dividend of 10.20mn rials was given to Ominvest by OAB. “A 
				bank’s role is to contribute to the development of the economy 
				and this is what we do. Today if I drive from Muscat to Sohar in 
				my car, I feel very proud because almost every road, every 
				street and every building that I pass by between the two towns 
				has been financed by my bank,” Askalan points out.<br>
				<br>
				That is how much a powerful presence has been established by OAB 
				in Oman since its inception on October 1, 1984 as a closed joint 
				stock company. The bank began its operations after acquiring the 
				branches of Arab Bank Plc, which had been operating in Oman 
				since 1973. Presently, Arab Bank holds 49 per cent stake in OAB 
				while the rest is held by Oman International Development and 
				Investment Co, the leading Omani investment company.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Steaming ahead<br>
				</b>“We have not been affected by the economic crisis. And as 
				you see, we are not suffering from any liquidity problems. We 
				will continue to concentrate, as usual, on project financing and 
				we increased our retail activity by issuing new products like 
				automobile and housing finance. Our retail balance has increased 
				by 25 per cent and we will increase our corporate portfolio by 
				more than 30 per cent this year,” says Askalan.<br>
				<br>
				“In the past 25 years we have never shown any losses. Every year 
				we have given dividends since we started operations in 1984. 
				What more do the shareholders want than this,” he says.<br>
				The interest on loans and advances increased by 4.34mn rials as 
				the loan book grew by 5.3 per cent at 583.40mn rials as compared 
				to 553.98mn rials in 2008. Personal loans grew by 36 per cent 
				while corporate loans were lower by seven per cent. OAB 
				increased its paid up share capital to 75mn rials from 60mn 
				rials and total equity stood at 126.48mn rials as compared to 
				110.46mn the previous year.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Range of services</b><br>
				OAB provides a comprehensive range of services in retail, 
				corporate and investment banking and has performed well in its 
				core banking namely trade finance and project finance in 
				infrastructure, petrochemicals, and industrial ventures. The 
				bank also provides a wide range of conventional and 
				sophisticated products and services for its retail customers 
				depending upon their requirements.<br>
				<br>
				The bank continued to be on top of the list of banks providing 
				project finance and related services in the country. The major 
				recent projects financed include Salalah Methanol; Sur IWP, 
				Barka IWPP phase II; Oman Shipping Company; Oman Aromatics and 
				Sohar Aluminium. This is in addition to the facilities granted 
				to the EPC contractors of these projects. OAB has also provided 
				facilities to Sohar Port development 3rd phase; Salalah Port 
				expansion; Haya (Oman Wastewater Services) and many other 
				international and local companies. <br>
				<br>
				Commenting on how OAB will go ahead in 2010, Askalan says, “We 
				will continue to concentrate on project finance, either 
				industrial or infrastructure or trade finance because there are 
				atleast three to four big projects in the pipeline including the 
				expansion of the Muscat International Airport. We will continue 
				to minimise our exposure to personal finance and housing loans. 
				My policy is not to pursue this sector (personal loans) as a 
				bank’s role is to support the economy and not to adopt practices 
				that would create a social problem for the government.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Retail market<br>
				</b>OAB has continued to adopt a strategy of diversifying itself 
				by rationalising and leveraging on the existing growth of the 
				last few years under the conservative umbrella by moving 
				aggressively into the retail market as well. <br>
				<br>
				The bank is studying the retail market needs and is coming out 
				with products and services that are need-based for the retail 
				customer who takes certain decisions that have financial 
				implications like car loans, car insurance etc.<br>
				<br>
				The retail banking division of OAB is also looking at various 
				developments in banking infrastructure like interacting with 
				customers through channels that are conducive to them like 
				telephone services, on demand banking etc and call centres for 
				transactions with various levels of empowerment.<br>
				<br>
				The bank is now building a new headquarter in Azaiba near the 
				ministry of tourism office as the present offices are housed in 
				residential flats earlier used by the company’s staff.</font></td>

				fallout of the global financial crisis on the banking sector</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				<b>BankMuscat recorded resilient results in 2009 and the key 
				business lines weathered the challenging situation resulting 
				from the global financial crisis. The bank achieved a net profit 
				of 73.7mn rials and an operating profit of 208.9mn rials as 
				against 152.6mn rials in 2008 -- an increase of 36.9 per cent. 
				The bank’s core business income during the year 2009 was strong 
				and stable in spite of the global financial crisis. The bank’s 
				gross loans and advances portfolio grew by 199mn rials or 5.2 
				per cent to 4,052mn rials in 2009 compared to 3,853mn rials in 
				2008. Savings and demand deposits increased by 9.6 per cent to 
				reach 1,796mn rials. The bank made a payout of 45 per cent 
				dividend, including 20 per cent cash and 25 per cent stock, for 
				2009. <br>
				<br>
				</b>Says AbdulRazak Ali Issa, Chief Executive, BankMuscat, “In 
				light of the challenges arising from the global financial 
				crisis, BankMuscat was focused on innovative products as well as 
				disciplined handling of risk and credit allocation. The strategy 
				helped in reducing risks and operating expenses besides finding 
				ways to generate revenues through innovative products and 
				customised services.” Impairment for credit losses on loans 
				portfolio was 98.2mn rials during 2009 compared to 24.6mn rials 
				in 2008. The impairment charge for 2009 was higher as the bank 
				decided to consider full provision for exposures in its overseas 
				branch. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Scale is the key <br>
				</b>With the largest underwriting capability amongst local banks 
				and strong corporate relationships in the region, BankMuscat has 
				the ability to add considerable value to projects in the form of 
				long term project financing underwritten at a senior capacity. 
				Apart from commercial term loans, the bank also provides working 
				capital facilities, which are needed for post-commercial 
				operations. This multi-layered participation in projects has 
				provided the bank with a pre-eminent position in project 
				financing in the Sultanate. <br>
				<br>
				The bank’s decision to issue a series of certificates of deposit 
				(CD) auction and a subordinated bond issue marked a major 
				milestone even as it won financial advisory mandate for 
				prestigious projects such as the Oswal Group’s caustic soda 
				project in Salalah. <br>
				<br>
				The bank’s investment banking business activities include 
				corporate finance and advisory, brokerage and research. The 60mn 
				rial eight per cent subordinated bond issue launched by 
				BankMuscat successfully closed on May 7, 2009, accepting 
				qualifying subscriptions of 115.6mn rials. The encouraging 
				response to the issue led the bank to exercise the Green Shoe 
				option of 15mn rials, thereby increasing the issue size and 
				allotment to 75mn rials. BankMuscat’s impressive performance in 
				financial advisory business was ranked 18th globally by both the 
				Infrastructure Journal (IJ) and Project Finance International 
				(PFI). This is by far the highest ranking achieved by a regional 
				bank in the global arena. BankMuscat was ranked 6th in Africa 
				and Middle East region, cementing its position as the premier 
				advisory outfit in the region. <br>
				<br>
				The bank’s decision to issue CDs worth 250mn rials through 
				auction over a one-year time-frame marked a major milestone in 
				2009. From nine rounds of CD auctions, BankMuscat accepted a 
				total of 152.40mn rials of bids against a subscription of 
				301.1mn rials. The CDs are considered as a good first step in 
				BankMuscat’s initiative to create a Riyal Omani benchmark rate. 
				The bank also launched precious metals hedging facility for 
				corporate. BankMuscat is the only commercial bank in the 
				Sultanate to offer a wide range of products to address price 
				fluctuation. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Reaching out<br>
				</b>Says Issa, “During 2009, BankMuscat consolidated operations 
				with a number of initiatives, notably the all-new al Mazyona 
				savings scheme and ‘Double Your Salary’ scheme with high-value 
				daily cash prizes.” The cards division treated customers with 
				the best value propositions. The bank signed agreements with a 
				number of government entities to introduce electronic card 
				payment facility for government services. The launch of e-Purse 
				marked the beginning of a new era of cashless society in Oman. 
				Over the past quarter century, BankMuscat’s presence has been 
				felt in all parts of Oman through the widest network of 125 
				branches, 362 ATMs, 112 CDMs and 4200 PoS terminals. BankMuscat 
				is on target to exceed one million satisfied customers in 2010.
				<br>
				<br>
				The bank signed a number of prestigious project and structured 
				finance agreements, notably for Oman Shipping Company’s Very 
				Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs); Salalah Independent Water and 
				Power Project; Sohar Port Special Projects; and Oman Refineries 
				&amp; Petrochemicals Company (ORPC). Says Issa, “BankMuscat will 
				continue to support viable projects in core areas like oil and 
				gas, petrochemicals and contracting. The bank is involved in 
				mega opportunities in developing areas such as Sohar, Salalah 
				and Duqm. BankMuscat is committed to help fuel the recovery 
				process as well as to tap into a resurgent Oman.” <br>
				<br>
				For the seventh consecutive year, BankMuscat won the Best 
				Foreign Exchange Bank in Oman award from Global Finance 
				magazine. The award was in recognition as the best currency 
				trading provider with the best online foreign exchange system, 
				besides the highest transaction volume, market share, scope of 
				global coverage, customer service, competitive pricing and 
				innovative technologies. <br>
				<br>
				<b>International operations<br>
				</b>Having a presence in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, 
				Pakistan and India, BankMuscat’s international operations 
				continued to deliver a wide range of cross-border finance 
				solutions through various expansion models and network entities. 
				In 2009, the bank disposed of its remaining 2.67 per cent stake 
				in HDFC Bank at a post-tax gain of 53.2mn rials. The bank also 
				obtained a commercial licence and necessary approvals to set up 
				a commercial banking branch in Kuwait and is currently pledging 
				to launch its operations during 2010.<br>
				<br>
				The year 2009 has been particularly challenging with the global 
				turmoil leaving an adverse impact on the progress of 
				BankMuscat’s international operations. Given these unfavourable 
				market conditions, the primary focus has shifted to 
				consolidation of strategic investments and increased 
				collaboration between cross-border entities with the aim of 
				achieving synergies and improved efficiencies. International 
				operations, however, continues to be central to the bank’s 
				strategy of prudent overseas expansion to meet customers’ 
				financial needs. <br>
				<br>
				In 2010, BankMuscat’s focus will be on offering the ‘Total 
				Customer Experience’. The Bank realises that innovative services 
				and products, especially electronic and online facilities, need 
				to be a focus area. BankMuscat plans to expand its footprint in 
				the GCC region with a new branch in Kuwait. The bank is 
				determined to consolidate operations on all fronts and achieve 
				greater heights of performance excellence in 2010.</font></td>

				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<b>The National Bank of Oman, the second largest commercial bank 
				in Oman, by shareholders’ equity and total assets, had taken a 
				conscious decision at the beginning of 2009 to focus its 
				attention on asset protection and credit enhancement on existing 
				assets keeping in mind the uncertain financial and credit 
				markets outlook. The bank also had taken steps to arrange 
				sufficient funding lines and reprice the existing loan assets.<br>
				<br>
				</b>These steps taken by the bank have yielded the desired 
				results as it was able to consolidate its asset portfolio and 
				achieve the desired revenue levels though the market, as a 
				whole, witnessed very marginal asset growth during the past 
				year.<br>
				<br>
				The bank successfully grew its net interest income by 20 per 
				cent to 56.8mn rials from 47.5mn rials in the previous year 
				through focused balance sheet management. Net spreads have also 
				improved to 3.24 per cent in 2009 up from 3.08 per cent in 2008 
				reflecting an improved return from existing assets.<br>
				<br>
				NBO’s net profit dipped to 21.1mn rials after tax for the 12 
				months ended December 31, 2009, compared to 45.4mn rials for the 
				same period in 2008. Notwithstanding very testing global market 
				conditions, the bank’s operating income was down only by seven 
				per cent to 81.9mn rials compared to 2008, the latter reflecting 
				a significant one-off gain on investment sales of 6mn rials. On 
				a like for like basis operating income was broadly flat.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Adequate measures<br>
				</b>Says Taqi Ali Sultan, general manager – Corporate Affairs &amp; 
				Communications, NBO, “the bank was conscious of the need to 
				maintain sufficient liquidity at all times during the year to 
				meet any eventuality in the financial markets. Therefore, we 
				launched deposit mobilisation initiatives and also arranged 
				standby credit lines to bolster liquidity. We also took 
				protective measures on the asset side and at the same time 
				ensured better return on risk taken on existing assets which 
				helped us to maintain its revenue generation on these assets.”<br>
				<br>
				The bank had marginal exposures to Dubai World and to the banks 
				in Bahrain, which are not directly related to Saad and Gosaibi 
				of Saudi Arabia. It has taken provisions on these assets as per 
				the Central Bank of Oman directives.<br>
				<br>
				Impairment provisions against investment portfolio was 4.1mn 
				rials and provisions of 8mn rials were taken against three 
				specific bank exposures. Whilst the debt restructuring process 
				for these banks is not yet complete, NBO has, on a prudent and 
				conservative basis, now provided 100 per cent against two of the 
				three banks and 75 per cent against the third. An additional 
				provision of 5mn rials has also been recognised against two 
				specific distressed real estate exposures.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Managing wealth<br>
				</b>NBO had a number of achievements to its credit in the year 
				gone by. The bank’s Wealth Management proposition, Sadara, 
				continued to expand with five new centres being established in 
				CBD Branch, Shatti Al Qurum, Mina Al Fahal, Sohar and Salalah. 
				Besides the increased number of branches and ATMs, NBO also 
				embarked on a significant refurbishment programme of all its 
				branches, to ensure that all its customers experienced the new 
				image of NBO. <br>
				<br>
				Al Kanz, a powerful savings account scheme, was launched by NBO 
				in 2009 and continues to set new records with a significant 
				growth in market share. Several other retail products and 
				initiatives were launched such as zero per cent Card Installment 
				Plan; a travel promotion with seven travel partners; as well as 
				in-store promotions at Lulu Hypermarkets, Home Center and E Max 
				stores.<br>
				<br>
				NBO also launched Himayati – the bank’s first insurance plan for 
				the life protection needs of its customers. Customer experience 
				has again been a key focus area for the bank in 2009. Noteworthy 
				initiatives included the implementation of a new, award winning 
				website together with SMS alerts for all credit and debit card 
				transactions. This was a first for the retail banking sector in 
				Oman.<br>
				<br>
				A dedicated Service Quality Division was also established to 
				monitor and address service quality issues, ensuring that 
				customer service breakdowns were attended to immediately. To 
				support this initiative, a mystery shopping exercise was 
				conducted, across the distribution network, to get a deeper 
				understanding of the customer experience.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Project financing<br>
				</b>The year 2009 did not see much activity in project financing 
				in the region. However, thanks to the various projects awarded 
				by the government, NBO was able to conclude a number of 
				transactions with large commitments. Two of the large projects 
				were Salalah IWPP and the Port of Sohar.<br>
				Commenting on this Sultan says, “NBO’s commitment to support the 
				projects especially in infrastructure development will continue 
				and we are already actively working on the financing of two 
				large power projects which are expected to raise financing to 
				the tune of $1.5bn this year.” NBO was a significant player in 
				the bidding stage and it assisted most of the international 
				bidding consortia by providing local market knowledge and the 
				necessary bond and guarantee facilities to them.<br>
				<br>
				The bank will continue to focus on sectors like petrochemicals, 
				infrastructure and trading for sustainable business as these are 
				growth prospects for 2010 and at the same time it will adopt a 
				cautious approach to volatile sectors like real estate and 
				commodities, opines Sultan.<br>
				<br>
				A number of projects continue to be undertaken in conjunction 
				with its strategic partner Commercial Bank of Qatar with the aim 
				of driving efficiencies by sharing global best practices in many 
				areas including cross-border business in terms of products, 
				processes and systems.</font></td>

				<br>
				</b>Reem Omar Zawawi, chairperson of the Board states in her 
				Board of Directors’ Report for 2009, “In the wake of diminishing 
				liquidity in financial markets across the globe, I am pleased to 
				announce that OIB maintained one of the strongest liquidity 
				positions by a bank in the Sultanate of Oman.” <br>
				<br>
				<b>Recovery issues<br>
				</b>In India OIB continued to focus on the recovery of 
				problematic advances. Says Zawawi, “Although this has limited 
				asset growth, it improves cost of funds and reduces operating 
				costs. The results continue to be encouraging with an 
				improvement in the net income.” The bank’s Indian operations 
				achieved a net profit of 811,000 rials in 2009 compared to 
				637,000 rials in 2008. <br>
				<br>
				OIB is committed to following the highest standards of corporate 
				governance and has complied with international best practice and 
				norms set by various regulatory bodies. The bank conducted the 
				quality assessment review of its internal audit function and was 
				certified by an external firm as ‘Exceptional.’ In addition, the

				<br>
				<b>Social conscience<br>
				</b>OIB has given due recognition to social responsibility that 
				it has to discharge as a large corporate entity in the 
				Sultanate. The bank provided significant sponsorships to various

				particular the bank supported major initiatives of the Ministry 
				of Education and the Information Technology Authority. These 
				include the gold sponsorship of Muscat Festival 2009, the main 
				sponsorship of the Muscat International Book Fair, sponsorship 
				of Khareef Tourism Festival in Salalah, Higher Education 
				Exhibition 2009 and an exclusive two year sponsorship to Oman 
				TVs Channel 2. The bank also contributed 100,000 rials to the 
				Oman Charitable Organisation. <br>
				<br>
				Staff training is an integral part of the banks HR strategies. 
				In 2009 the bank provided 288 training courses both in-house and 
				external which were local and overseas and had 2,887 staff 
				participants. Says Zawawi, “The bank looks to the future with

				Sohar to gain market share and to post good numbers<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<b>The year 2009 saw Bank Sohar achieving multiple objectives -- 
				gaining market share, growing to a respectable size and creating 
				a large footprint in Oman. The bank commenced business in 2009 
				as the fourth largest bank in Oman in terms of loans and 
				advances and its share of private sector credits stood at 8.2 
				per cent, while the share of private sector deposits was 7.9 per 
				cent at the end of the year. The bank has increased its branch 
				network from 11 at the end of 2008 to 14 at the end of 2009. 
				Says Dr Mohamed Abdulaziz Kalmoor, CEO, Bank Sohar, “The bank 
				has largely been insulated from the economic turmoil in the 
				region and the world. Our growth was achieved due to judicious 
				management and within the prudent parameters of risk. The bank 
				adopted proactive risk management measures due to which the 
				bank’s asset quality has remained exceptional.”<br>
				</b><br>
				<b>Retail focus</b><br>
				The bank continued its efforts to offer banking services to 
				communities in all regions. The growth in retail products during 
				the year 2009 has been encouraging and the bank has been able to 
				grow its assets and abilities. Several new retail products and 
				promotions were launched to meet the expectations and 
				requirements of customers. Ready cash, a hybrid financial 
				solution and the Al Mumayaz instant interest fixed deposit were 
				launched in the first quarter of the year. This was followed by 
				a credit card promotion for the bank’s Platinum, Gold and 
				Classic cards.<br>
				<br>
				The bank now has 14 on site ATMs and 15 offsite ATMs. In 
				addition, Bank Sohar customers continue to enjoy the facility of 
				free of charge access to over 500 ATMs under the OmanSwitch 
				located all over the country. <br>
				<br>
				During the year, Bank Sohar added three new branches to the 
				network – two in the Batinah Region at Saham and Suwaiq and one 
				in Sharqiya at Jaalan Bani Bu Ali. It has also been able to 
				provide the bank’s entire suite of products and world class 
				services to all the customers in these areas. Savings deposits 
				of retail customers has shown a marked increase from 73.67mn 
				rials at the close of the year December 2008 to 92.93mn rials at 
				the close of 2009 (an increase of 26 per cent). <br>
				<br>
				To meet customer expectations of customers and to garner savings 
				deposits, two major Savings Schemes were launched and conducted 
				during the year. The first, Al Mumayaz Savings Scheme 2009 was 
				launched early in the year with improved incentives for 
				customers. The scheme was relaunched in August 2009 with more 
				prizes, including high value cash prizes. “The bank has 
				continued its efforts to reach out to customers, to bond and to 
				interact with them. Through a series of planned activities, we 
				have been able to enhance equity for the brand ‘Bank Sohar,’ 
				says Dr Kalmoor. The bank was selected as one of Oman’s 
				Superbrands.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Corporate finance<br>
				</b>The wholesale banking group is one of the major contributors 
				to the business of the bank. <br>
				<br>
				With a view to position the bank strategically for the SME 
				sector, the erstwhile SME department has been redesigned as the 
				Emerging Corporate Banking Unit. The unit caters to the 
				financial requirements of SMEs and to mid-size corporates. The 
				support to this sector has resulted the growth of assets of 
				almost 97 per cent as compared to 2008. <br>
				<br>
				The bank has pursued growth with prudent lending practices. 
				Despite the difficult market conditions during the year, it has 
				realised phenomenal growth thanks to the personalised services 
				provided to the customer and the consistent efforts to build 
				relationships. Prudent lending practices have helped the bank to 
				build an excellent portfolio and to maintain its asset quality.<br>
				<br>
				The development of national manpower receives top priority at 
				the bank. The recruitment and training of Omani graduates 
				continued during the year. All openings that arose during the 
				year were publicised internally with a view to provide the 
				bank’s own staff with opportunities for growth and development. 
				Recognising the importance of individual aspirations and the 
				importance of strategic planning, Bank Sohar has implemented 
				succession planning for critical posts. The bank currently has a 
				staff strength of 448 and an Omanisation level of 86 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				The bank has implemented the Oracle Human Resource Management 
				System. A Performance Management System and the Training System 
				have been implemented in each of the branches. These systems 
				include the Annual Performance Review module and the system to 
				set targets and key result areas.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Financial performance<br>
				</b>The net profit for the period ended 31st December 31, 2009 
				stood at 8.02mn rials. This was arrived at after considering the 
				general provision on portfolio basis on the loan book amounting 
				to 2.05mn rials as per the guidelines of the Central Bank of 
				Oman. During the year, the bank made an operating profit of 
				11.91mn rials which is 131 per cent higher than the operating 
				profit for the year 2008. Says Dr Kalmoor, “This profit has been 
				achieved primarily by a risk-controlled growth of the loan book, 
				improved yields on assets, reduced cost of funding, improved 
				balance sheet management and improved cost efficiency. The focus 
				on risk management also resulted in reducing loan loss 
				provisioning.”<br>
				<br>
				During the year, the bank built a total customer credit exposure 
				of 799.45mn rials and customer deposits of 832.45mn rials 
				servicing more than 71,500 customers. Its savings deposits have 
				increased to 93mn rials. The growth in customer assets during 
				the period was 24 per cent and growth in customer deposits was 
				126 per cent. The bank was able to increase its market share 
				consistently during the year and has closed the year with 8.2 
				per cent of private sector credit and 6.8 per cent of total 
				deposits, as computed with reference to industry data of 
				November 2009.<br>
				<br>
				The net interest income of 22.89mn rials was primarily due to 
				the growth in the bank’s loan book, improved yields on assets, 
				reduced cost of liability and improved balance sheet management.<br>
				<br>
				The non-interest income for 2009 amounted to 6.27mn rials. 
				Non-interest income consists of fees and commissions and 
				includes account servicing fees, credit related fees, advisory 
				fees and other management fees, sales commission, placement fees 
				and syndication fees. The bank continues its focus on 
				significantly increasing its fee based income. The cost to 
				income ratio of the bank has improved to 59 per cent in 2009 as 
				compared to 71 per cent in 2008.<br>
				<br>
				The bank’s capital adequacy ratio, calculated according to the 
				guidelines set by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) 
				was 12.93 per cent as on December 31, 2009. While the 
				international requirement as per BIS is eight per cent, the 
				Central Bank of Oman’s regulations stipulate that banks maintain 
				a BIS ratio of 10 per cent or more. Speaking about the banks 
				plans in 2010, Dr Kalmoor says, “We will continue improving our 
				operational efficiency and effectiveness and will add new 
				business lines. It is a dynamic process and a long journey but 
				we need to focus on it on a daily basis.”</font></td>

				is laying a strong foundation for sustained growth over the 
				years<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<b>The year 2008 was a year of transition for Ahli Bank as it 
				converted from a mortgage finance bank into a full-fledged 
				commercial bank (on January 5, 2008). Having completed that 
				process 2009 saw the bank firmly establishing itself on a growth 
				trajectory. Says Abdulaziz al Balushi, CEO, Ahli Bank, “We had a 
				good year despite the international financial crisis. Both our 
				productivity and efficiency improved and this finds a reflection 
				in our financial results.” Ahli Bank’s net operating income grew 
				by 24 per cent in 2009 to 17.9mn rials, while its net profit 
				went up by 43.96 per cent to 8.5mn rials from 5.9mn rials in 
				2008. <br>
				<br>
				Retail thrust </b><br>
				In 2009, Ahli Bank focused on aggressive expansion with new 
				branches, Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs), the relocation of 
				one branch as well as the introduction of a growing portfolio of 
				products. The bank opened five new branches in 2009 taking its 
				network of branches to 12. Its Sur and Sohar branches were 
				renovated in January 2009 and the Ibri branch was relocated in 
				March 2009. Five off-site ATM’s were added during the year as 
				part of the banks customer-focused strategic expansion across 
				the Sultanate. The new ATMs are located in Qurum, City Centre, 
				Muscat City Center, Al Khoud, Al Seeb Souq and Safeer Mall 
				bringing the total number of Ahli Bank ATMs to 17. <br>
				<br>
				It introduced the first ATM-chip debit card, equipped with smart 
				card technology also known as Chip and PIN in July 2009. The new 
				debit cards offer customers a much higher level of security 
				against fraud as well as quicker transaction times. In March 
				2009, Ahli Bank announced the enhanced MyHassad Savings Scheme 
				which offers bigger rewards to customers. The enhanced scheme 
				offers customers the chance to win 250,000 rials in the Salary 
				for Life Draw (250 months of 1,000 rials per month) at the end 
				of September, as well as monthly prize draws of 10,000 rials. 
				The daily prize draws of 1,000 rials have been maintained making 
				this the first savings account in Oman to have a winner 
				announced every working day. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Cherry picking<br>
				</b>The bank has been conservative in disbursing loans and in 
				line with the strategy its deposits have grown more than its 
				advances. The capital and reserves of the bank in 2009 stood at 
				92.62mn rials compared to 87.1mn rials in 2008. The capital 
				adequacy ratio of the bank was 17.62 per cent well above the 
				minimum ratio of 10 per cent required by CBO. The gross loan 
				book grew modestly by 18.12 per cent to reach 446.56mn rials as 
				on December 31, 2009. A large part of this increase has been in 
				the bank’s corporate book. Says Al Balushi, “We believe that it 
				is better to forego some growth, if one is unsure about it. In 
				retrospect, our strategy has proved right as our deposit base 
				has grown and we have had no exposure to any bad loans 
				regionally.” <br>
				<br>
				The bank has adopted a prudent risk management approach in view 
				of the prevailing global financial crisis and its implication. 
				Its customer deposits increased to 466.71mn rials in 2009, an 
				increase of over 46.19 per cent over 2008. This is mainly due to 
				the bank offering new products and increase in the number of new 
				customers. The growth is in line with the bank’s strategy to 
				create a diversified stable low cost funding base. The net 
				profit of the bank has increased by 43.96 per cent to 8.54mn 
				rials in the year 2009. There has been a significant improvement 
				in the banks cost to income ratio. Operating costs year-on-year 
				has increased. The increase in expenditure was essentially due 
				to the investment in human resources, IT development and branch 
				network expansion, commensurate to business requirements and the 
				bank’s business plans.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Credit quality <br>
				</b>The bank’s loan book continues to be of a high quality and 
				this is reflected in its low NPL ratio of 0.32 per cent as of 
				December 31, 2009. The bank has adopted a prudent risk based 
				approach to lending which ensures good quality control both in 
				assessment and follow-up. “Over the last few months, the 
				downturn in the global economy has had an impact on all players 
				in the financial sector even domestically and this has put a 
				dampener on our efforts to mobilise more low cost long term 
				deposits. Liquidity not being as issue, the cost of deposits is 
				certainly a cause for concern,” says Al Balushi. Keeping this in 
				mind the bank has moderated its growth by introducing stringent 
				risk policies. <br>
				<br>
				The bank plans to build its portfolio of SME clients over 2010 
				with an enhanced range of products and is targeting SMEs that 
				comply with the proposed business banking criteria across nearly 
				all industry sectors. It has introduced a new credit approval 
				process to streamline working capital finance for SMEs. The 
				product will form part of the bank’s ‘Business Banking’ basket 
				of SME features, designed to simplify credit application. <br>
				<br>
				Aimed at companies with a turnover of up to 2mn rials the 
				product aims to provide SMEs with competitive financial products 
				with features including competitive pricing, new product 
				structures tailored specifically to SMEs, a faster turnaround on 
				credit applications and high quality of service. Ahli Bank’s 
				corporate banking division has the benefit of access to a group 
				balance sheet for large deals and can provide a direct 
				connection to the markets of Ahli United Bank. <br>
				<br>
				Ahli Bank’s Foreign Trade Department with trade finance 
				specialists is capable of servicing corporate clients with a 
				full range of products and services which can process customer 
				transactions from start to finish within 24 hours time frame.
				<br>
				<br>
				Al Balushi sums up, “Ahli Bank continues to maintain its leading 
				position in providing the most convenient housing mortgage 
				facilities to customers in Oman. More importantly, the bank has 
				made significant progress in building the commercial bank, 
				diversifying its portfolio through catering to the demands of 
				the corporate businesses in Oman while carefully differentiating 
				the needs of the premium, private banking segments, as well as 
				the SME segments.” Having built a strong foundation, the bank 
				can look forward to strong growth in the coming years. </font></td>

				<b>HSBC Oman invested heavily in three big areas in 2009. One, 
				was working closely with the Central Bank of Oman in terms of 
				automation. The bank implemented systems like Real Time Gross 
				Settlement (RTGC), BSDC (automated cheque clearing) and BCSB 
				(Banking Code Standards Board). Secondly, the bank moved onto a 
				new IT platform. The back office too was enhanced with the 
				application of a new software – Gold Suite -7. The new system 
				has brought in new efficiencies. For example, the bank can now 
				process a loan application within 40 minutes – from the time it 
				is applied for till disbursement. Thirdly, it put 400 of its 
				staff through major training programmes. Close to 20 per cent of 
				its staff were sent abroad for training. And the results show – 
				The bank’s annual Global People Engagement survey showed that 84 
				per cent of its staff in Oman said that they were proud to work 
				for the bank and were confident about its direction. The Middle 
				East average for the survey was 56 per cent. Says Ewan Stirling, 
				CEO, HSBC Bank Middle East, Oman, “Though we knew that 2009 was 
				going to be a difficult year, we invested in our people and 
				systems as we believe in long term growth.”<br>
				</b><br>
				<b>A confident show <br>
				</b>Despite the downturn, the bank has managed to remain 
				profitable and resilient. “Despite the problems in Europe, we 
				are well capitalised and posted good profits in Asia. Liquidity 
				has never been an issue for us (in Oman) as our exposure to the 
				real estate sector is less than two per cent and we have no 
				exposure to stock market investments.” Though the topline of the 
				bank went down marginally, it is confident about posting good 
				numbers in 2010. “The year has started well for us and we are 
				cautiously optimistic. The only cause for concern is consumer 
				sentiment which remains depressed.” The bank plans to expand its

				Having been in the Sultanate for 61 years HSBC has strong local 
				grassroots. Says Stirling, “Despite our roots in the Sultanate, 
				we do not seek to be a local bank, we are a bank which has a 
				strong local presence with international expertise. HSBC is the 
				best place to bank for people who have cross border needs.” <br>
				<br>
				Project finance remains a core strength for HSBC. Over the years 
				it has financed all the airport projects, power plants, ports 
				and a number of industries in Sohar. Being a conservative bank, 
				HSBC maintains a high level of provisions. “We tend to lend to 
				need and not to demand. We also ensure that our debt-to-loan 
				ratio remains very good.” The bank has been a consistent player 
				in the Middle East market and its commitment to the local market 
				remains unsurpassed. <br>

				since 1976 , is keen to double its presence in Oman in the next 
				three to five years and has ambitious aims to become the leading 
				non-Omani bank in Oman. <br>
				<br>
				</b>Saeed Mubarak, Regional Manager, Oman, commenting on NBAD’s 
				performance said the key features include the consistent 
				profitability and value creation to shareholders; the bank’s 
				positioning for growth from the global economic recovery and 
				NBAD’s high ratings in the Middle East.<br>
				<br>
				Other features include NBAD being rated among the world’s 50 
				safest banks, its clear and focused strategy, its large domestic 
				presence and finally its international network, which is the 
				largest among the UAE banks.<br>
				<br>
				Mubarak disclosed that currently NBAD is represented in 12 
				countries with 48 units spread through Asia, the MENA region, 
				Europe and the USA. The bank’s Hong Kong Branch was opened in 
				December 2009 and in February 2010, a full commercial branch was 
				opened in Amman, Jordan. <br>
				<br>
				In Oman, after remaining a single branch operations for nearly 
				30 years, the bank has spread to seven branches all over the 
				country with one branch each in Sohar, Nizwa and Salalah and 
				four branches in the capital area of Muscat. An eighth branch is 
				due to be opened in Sur in a couple of months. NBAD always seeks 
				to complement the local banks and even more importantly to 
				contribute to the social development and growth of the national 
				economy of Oman. This is in line with NBAD’s international 
				strategy as it strives to become the number one Arab bank by 
				expanding its branch network across the globe.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from expanding its branch network, NBAD has a number of 
				other significant achievements in Oman, says Ahmed Al Musalmi, 
				deputy regional manager of NBAD. Over the last 24 months, the 
				bank almost doubled the number of its employees while 
				maintaining the Omanisation ratios. <br>
				<br>
				NBAD also strengthened it regional management team by 
				establishing Central Operations Division, Risk Management 
				Division.. inducting three women at senior management levels 
				including one head of privilege banking. “We are in the business 
				of relationships not numbers. Therefore, although the year has 
				been challenging, we have remained focused on ‘creating and 
				maintaining relations’ with our clients. As such we have done 
				pretty well in 2009 with the bottom line up by over 87 per cent 
				in 2009 as compared to 2008,” says Al Musalmi. Despite the 
				global financial crisis, NBAD’s net profit for the 2009 rose to 
				2.86mn rials as compared to 1.53mn rials the previous year with 
				negligible NPAs.<br>
				<br>
				“Every bank had to take some special measures in dealing with 
				the inevitable challenges. We worked closely with our clients, 
				both our depositors and borrowers, to ensure that we achieve a 
				win-win solution. Further, our parent bank has been extremely 
				supportive whenever we needed dollar funding to support local 
				project financing,” disclosed Al Musalmi while talking about how 
				the bank was able to tide over the 2009 challenges. <br>
				<br>
				NBAD will continue to focus its corporate, retail and elite 
				business which is at the core of its business activities. The 
				bank’s focus is also to support all government initiatives, as 
				it believes that the sound economic and monetary policies 
				coupled with a clear economic vision of Oman gives it the 
				inspiration to build up and strengthen its infrastructure to 
				play an even more effective role in realising the economic 
				vision<br>

				<b>The bank has had seven successive years of record income and 
				profit. This is a clear indication of the resilience of our 
				business, and sustainability and diversity of our income streams 
				and shows that we have the right strategy in the right markets. 
				We have strengthened our capital and liquidity position and 
				increased investment in the business and have generated 
				substantial value for our shareholders,” says Ravneet Chowdhury, 
				CEO, Standard Chartered, Oman. <br>
				</b><br>
				<b>Turbulent times<br>
				</b>To negotiate the financial crisis the bank followed a clear 
				strategy -- it kept an eye on its core markets of Asia, Africa 
				and the Middle East as these are markets that it knows well. “We 
				have a very strong sense of values, which makes the bank 
				extremely cohesive and in many ways, we have been regarded as a 
				boring conservative bank,” says Chowdhury. A combination of 
				these factors worked well enabling the bank to continue 
				delivering consistent growth over the past few years. “What is 
				important is our ability and commitment to support our customers 
				through the challenging times. We view ourselves as a force for 
				good for our communities and we understand the social importance 
				of banks in the creation of a sustainable economic environment,” 
				he adds. <br>
				<br>
				Standard Chartered PLC is listed on both the London Stock 
				Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and ranks among the 
				top 20 companies in the FTSE-100 by market capitalisation. The 
				London-headquartered group has operated for over 150 years in 
				some of the world’s most dynamic markets. <br>
				<br>
				The bank is confident about its future due to a number of 
				factors. Oman is in a healthy position with the surpluses 
				accumulated over the past years and enhanced government spending 
				which will be the key driver of growth. The bank views the 
				slowdown as being cyclical rather than structural and expects 
				its key markets in the East to return to growth before the West. 
				“We are seeing signs of improving macroeconomic data across 
				these markets, however we believe it is too early to call a 
				sustained recovery. At Standard Chartered, we will continue to 
				focus on economic reality and are preparing ourselves to take a 
				stronger market position,” says Chowdhury.<br>
				<br>
				The bank’s priority is to sustain the momentum in wholesale 
				banking and complete the transformation of its consumer banking 
				to a customer focused platform. “We need to stay absolutely 
				focused on the basics of banking: on the way we manage 
				liquidity, capital, risks and costs. We will grow investments 
				broadly in line with revenue. And we will grab the opportunity 
				to reinforce our brand as we step up into a bigger international 
				arena,” avers Chowdhury.<br>

				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<b>Ramy F Zambarakji, managing director, Bank of Beirut, Oman 
				Branches is a pleased man. The bank has seen a 11 per cent 
				growth in profits and a 30 per cent increase in its balance 
				sheet during 2009. Says Zambarakji, “We never expected the year 
				to be as good as it turned out to be. We cater to Omani 
				corporates and our exposures are confined to the Sultanate and 
				since Oman was least affected we too did not feel the impact of 
				the crisis.” While there were apprehensions about lending money 
				to corporates, the bank continued lending to reputed 
				construction companies which won contracting projects from the 
				government. “We have some big corporate customers and we do not 
				shy away from lending to them if the project is sound and it 
				makes financial sense,” says Zambarakji<br>
				<br>
				Stable moorings</b><br>
				Its parent, Bank of Beirut had a global asset base of around 
				$800 mn (312.5mn rials) in 2008-09 with ten branches around the 
				world. This gives Bank of Beirut in Oman a single borrower limit 
				of 30mn rials. The bank is one of Lebanon ’s leading commercial 
				banks operating in six countries and offering a large range of 
				wholesale and retail banking services. The bank’s current 
				management has pursued a policy of focused strategy that 
				emphasised growth (whether organic or through acquisitions), 
				innovation in products and services, as well as value creation.<br>
				<br>
				The bank has had a conservative ethos and this has stood it in 
				good stead during the global financial meltdown. “Says 
				Zambarkaji, “We are very picky in choosing our customers, but 
				once we establish a relationship with a customer, it becomes 
				very easy as we provide them dedicated service and attention.” 
				The bank realises that it does not have the infrastructure to 
				cater to everyone and therefore concentrates on its niches. <br>
				<br>
				“We are not a mass service bank and we are here to cater to a 
				certain layer of customers. The secret of our success is that we 
				have behaved as a part of Oman’s economy from the day we came 
				and established a branch here,” avers Zambarakji. The bank has 
				two branches in Muscat and Sohar. It has invested in a 
				state-of-the-art head office in Ghubrah, Muscat which is 
				expected to become operational this year. In the wake of the 
				global financial crisis the bank was forced to increase its 
				lending rates in 2009 by around one per cent, as the cost of 
				borrowing went up, but things have eased since then. <br>
				<br>
				Says Zambarakji, “Interest rates have softened and we expect a 
				big reduction by the middle of 2010.” The year has begun on a 
				strong note for the bank and it expects a 10 per cent increase 
				in its balance sheet during 2010. The bank also hopes to ride 
				the tide of a growing economy to reach new heights. <br>

				<b>Branching out<br>
				</b>The bank wants to expand its presence in the Sultanate and

				bank remained unscathed by the financial crisis for a variety of 
				reasons. Says Faheem, “Compared to the UAE we have not been 
				affected as the CBO has been telling banks not to lend to the 
				real estate sector or to take exposure on the stock market.” <br>
				<br>
				The bank did not increase its interest rates due to global 
				liquidy problems and its repayments remained strong in 2009 but 
				there was a slowdown in the bank’s day-to-day operations. Says 
				Faheem, “If you give customers good products and service they 
				will surely bank with you.” As the bank strengthens its presence

				2009, the bank’s net profit increased by 15 per cent to QR4202mn 
				(444.30mn Omani rials), the highest in the bank’s history. As a 
				result of the expansion in business activities, its total assets 
				increased to QR179.3bn (18.95bn Omani rials), recording a growth 
				of 18 per cent over the prior year. <br>
				<br>
				QNB’s is rapidly expanding its international presence to include 
				new locations around the world to supplement its long 
				established branches in London and Paris. QNB has a presence in 
				22 countries which include branches in Yemen, Oman, Kuwait and 
				Singapore as well as representative offices in Iran and Libya. 
				An Islamic branch was recently inaugurated in Sudan, offering a 
				full range of Islamic banking services and products.<br>
				<b>Local moorings<br>
				</b>QNB started operations in Oman in May 2008. Says Saad Musa 
				Al-Jenaibi, general manager – Oman, QNB, “We are looking at 
				complementing Omani Banks rather than competing with them. We 
				are mainly a corporate finance bank, with a focus on project 
				financing in sectors like infrastructure, oil and gas etc.”<br>
				<br>
				The bank is looking at expanding its presence in Oman from a 
				single branch operation to four branches in 2010. The bank has 
				got approvals for opening three new branches in Muscat, Sohar 
				and Nizwa. This will increase the bank’s manpower strength from 
				24 to over 50 this year. “We would like to have a presence in 
				the larger towns of Oman, to support the economy and to create 
				jobs for Omanis,” avers Al-Jenaibi. <br>
				<br>
				Thanks to its prudent policies QNB, Oman negotiated the 
				financial crisis without any exposures. Says Al-Jenaibi, 
				“Despite the turmoil we had a really good year due to the wise 
				policies of our senior management, which kept us away from risky 
				businesses. I am an old fashioned banker who believes that we 
				are responsible and accountable for the trust reposed in us by 
				our depositors.” <br>

				Development Bank has been playing a catalytic role in promoting 
				small and medium enterprises in the Sultanate<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<b>Oman Development Bank (ODB) in its present form was the 
				result of the merger of Oman Bank for Agriculture and Fisheries 
				and ODB which specialised in financing industries. The bank 
				finances projects with an upper loan for a single project, not 
				exceeding 1mn rials. It also has a scheme for small units with 
				investment of 5,000 rials and below, which is fully exempted 
				from interest. <br>
				</b><br>
				The mandate of the bank is to promote small and medium 
				enterprises (SMEs) in the Sultanate. SMEs are risky, but they 
				create wealth and employment opportunities and therefore need to 
				be promoted assertively. While a market mechanism is the best 
				fund provider for SMEs, it is not efficient in the early stages 
				of a start up, mainly in developing economies. Since most new 
				entrepreneurs need coaching and cannot own the risk through 
				enough collaterals, there is a temporary role for a government 
				development bank and government supported venture capital funds. 
				And there is where ODB’s role comes in. <br>
				<br>
				The bank acts as a trustee of other government financing schemes 
				like Sanad (Ministry of Manpower), Life Resources Fund (Ministry 
				of Social Development) and Agriculture and Fisheries Development 
				Fund. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Challenging environment<br>
				</b>Says Samir Saied, general manager, ODB, “In 2009, we have 
				been more conservative, in line with the prudent approach of our 
				customers. Our new disbursements remained at the same level as 
				those of 2008 -- at around 33mn rials. This contrasts with the 
				substantial annual doubling witnessed from 2005 till 2008.

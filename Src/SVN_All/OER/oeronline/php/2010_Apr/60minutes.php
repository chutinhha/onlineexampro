			<br>
			</b>The Service Training Award was presented to Zubair Automotive 
			following its collaboration with some of its key clients to offer a 
			driver training programme. The programme is designed specifically to 
			help individual companies who have purchased Fuso products by 
			training their own drivers to correctly use and operate their new 
			vehicles. The Historic Sales Award was presented for achieving 
			record sales, in terms of volume, in 2008.

			Fuso Sales Team Oman wih the awards</font></b></p>

			<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Can 
			you give us a short overview of Fuso’s presence in Oman and the 
			reason for its success in Oman?</b><br>
			Raju Bisht: We have about 55 per cent of the overall market share in 
			Oman primarily because of the strong brand presence in the market 
			and our ability to provide a top quality product backed by service 
			stations across the sultanate. A number of our service stations are 
			concentrated in the interior and PDO areas so that we can provide 
			optimal service to our clients and we have service stations in 17 
			locations. The range and variety of our products also help to 
			contribute to our highly successful sales figures.<br>
			<br>
			Our range varies from 3 tonne to 18 tonne trucks and we have started 
			to introduce to the market prime movers, tractor heads and transit 
			mixers. We also have a professional sales team to provide the 
			appropriate solution to customers’ needs. Fuso’s in-dash gearshift 
			is one of the reasons why it is also appreciated by the drivers as 
			much as the companies who purchase them simply because of the 
			comfort it can provide. In addition, we are also very competitively 
			priced making our products excellent investments.<br>
			<br>
			Mark Tomlinson: I also think our service network has been a very 
			important factor for us in achieving our sales results. I guess the 
			option of a commercial vehicle opposed to a car becomes an important 
			business tool. So people invariably use these to conduct a service 
			or to generate some sort of revenue and income. We must also ensure 
			that we provide appropriate backup services and we have an excellent 
			regional infrastructure, particularly in the PDO areas, that allows 
			us to achieve this. This is one reason why our clients truly value 
			our brand, not just because of its reliability but because we can 
			provide an efficient support service to keep the vehicles well 
			maintained.<br>
			<br>
			Another thing that sets us apart from the competitors is the people 
			that we have in the team, their knowledge base and the professional 
			advice that they provide to clients is unsurpassed in the industry. 
			They provide clients with solutions that are tailor-made to suit 
			their individual and business needs.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Do you have any business strategies in place for your continued 
			success in Oman?</b><br>
			<b>RB: </b>We have training sessions in place for all the current 
			sales staff and technicians to ensure we offer the highest levels of 
			quality from our sales interaction with customers through to the 
			technical and service back up we provide. <br>
			<br>
			<b>MT:</b> We have a technical training team based in our workshops 
			here in Muscat. The vehicles that we sell require a certain degree 
			of technical ability and knowledge in order to offer the best 
			professional advice. So we consistently get our trainers to train 
			our staff on all of the various scenarios that may occur when 
			dealing with clients. Therefore if a client has a specific 
			requirement we can actually sit with them and talk with confidence 
			about the product that we have to fulfil their needs. As such we can 
			guarantee that it will meet their requirements, do what they need it 
			to do and best perform the service that they require of it. <br>
			<br>
			We also recently received an accolade from Fuso for our customer 
			training. For this we tailor made a series of driver training 
			courses for some of our larger fleet customers. We would invite 
			their drivers into our business and engage them in a classroom 
			environment where they would learn how to get the best from the 
			vehicle they would be driving from both theory discussions and 
			actual product demonstrations.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Are there any plans to expand your network?</b><br>
			<b>MT: </b>The network coverage we have is fairly comprehensive 
			already and covers most key areas within the Sultanate. We are now 
			reviewing how we can work more effectively with our clients to 
			provide them an even better level of service, either through 
			enhancing our after sales network or through offering mobile 
			workshop facilities to provide greater convenience and less downtime 
			for our customers that operate in the more remote areas of the 
			country. As a business our objective is to ensure that we offer our 
			clients the most flexible and efficient service in order that they 
			can maximise the utilisation and productivity of their fleet, thus 
			increasing their return on the investment they have made.<br>
			<br>
			<b>How have the recent fluctuations in market conditions affected 
			your business?</b><br>
			<b>RB: </b>Nearly everyone in the sector was affected by a certain 
			degree and in this regard we were not completely spared either. But 
			thanks to the Sultanate’s strategy towards investment and ongoing 
			business development, we were able to secure good business because 
			of the various projects that are underway in Oman.<br>
			<br>
			<b>MT:</b> The market conditions have affected everybody, but we 
			have seen our loyal clients stand by both Zubair and the Fuso brand. 
			We have endeavoured to support our customers in return by offering 
			flexible packages and funding arrangements. This way we have managed 
			to support and maintain our core client base through these difficult 
			trading times and we are confident that they will reciprocate this 
			support in future. 2008 was a record year for us in terms of pure 
			sales volume whilst we did not quite reach the same level in 2009 
			that was a year of challenging economic times for everyone. We are 
			extremely confident in breaking some more records in 2010.&nbsp;

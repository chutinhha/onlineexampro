            versatility in mind. The FinePix S602 offers a bright F2.8 Super EBC 
            (Electron Beam Coating) Fujinon 6X (35-210mm) zoom lens with a 
            13-step aperture. Coupled to a new focusing system, the new third 
            generation 3.1 million effective pixels Super-CCD system can yield 
            1600 ISO at one mega pixel with minimal electronic noise, higher 
            shutter speeds and extraordinary performance. The new third 
            generation Super CCD system uses Fujifilm's new Pixel Data Coupling 
            Technology to produce ultra sharp yet colourful 6.0 million pixel 
            images. Also featured is our pixel-mixing technology, which can 
            produce digital VGA resolution movies at 30 frames per seconds. 
            Other features include: dual media slots, a manual focus ring, 
            aperture or Shutter priority, AE scene modes, custom white balance, 
            hot shoe mount and an electronic mini LCD through-the-lens (TTL) 
            viewfinder (Optional .79X wide angle lens or a 1.5X telephoto lens 
            with 55 mm filter adapter tube is available).</font><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><br>

              </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Voyager has come up with 
            a comprehensive system. It's a fully portable DVD system for the 
            car, with a 5.6&quot; screen and high quality cordless headphones. The 
            screen will attach to the headrest of most cars (it can be powered 
            by the car's cigarette lighter), or can be mounted on its little 
            stand for use in the home. Long drives with whingeing passengers 
            will be but a distant memory. You can attach another screen to the 
            unit, and add extra headphones to keep the rabble in the back of the 
            car happy and, perhaps most importantly, quiet. The system comes 
            with the following: multi-regional DVD player; 5.6&quot; screen; headrest 
            mount; tabletop stand; one set of cordless stereo headphones; remote 
            control; cigarette lighter and main power cables; universal RCA jack 
            lead so you can connect it to your TV.<br>

            next big thing from Apple: The new 17-inch PowerBook G4. Featuring 
            the largest, most spectacular display ever to grace a portable, 
            miraculously engineered into a 1-inch-thin notebook that's 
            ultralight (just 6.8 pounds). Apple's increasing compatibility with 
            Microsoft brings the Microsoft Office to you in recognisable form on 
            your Apple. The chip architecture is such that 1ghz on an Apple 
            brings you twice the performance you would get from an intel chip of 
            the same speed. Your PowerBook G4 with SuperDrive (DVD-R/CD-RW) 
            comes loaded with iDVD software, and can be used to burn DVDs, which 
            can be played in most consumer DVD players. The SuperDrive also lets 
            you use iTunes to burn your own music CDs, and the Disc Burner 
            feature in Mac OS X to burn data CDs. The SuperDrive reads DVD 
            titles at 6x, and writes to 4.7-gigabyte DVD-R discs at 1x.</font><hr color="#CC3333">

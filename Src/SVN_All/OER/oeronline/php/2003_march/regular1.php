                  <br>
              <font face="Verdana" size="2">Oil prices are scaling historic 
            peaks and Gulf oil producers have been increasing output for months. 
            What's more, three years of consistently high oil revenues are 
            fuelling economic booms across the region. It seems that oil 
            powerhouses such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab 
            Emirates have never had it so good. <br>
            Maybe. But the party could soon be over. February bore witness to 
            two events that pose a direct and credible threat to the Middle 
            East's position as the dominant global energy provider (the region 
            satisfies more than 40 per cent of the world's daily oil needs). Oil 
            consumers are fighting back, launching multi-billion dollar 
            initiatives aimed at releasing the Middle East's stranglehold on 
            global energy supply. <br>
            First, on February 7, 2003, US President George W. Bush hosted a 
            high profile conference for hydrogen fuel developers. The guest list 
            included consultants, academics and, crucially, car manufacturers 
            such as General Motors and Toyota. President Bush pledged US$1.2 
            billion towards research into commercially viable fuel cells. <br>
            The move was a determined effort to put flesh on the bones of his 
            State of the Union address a few days earlier, during which he 
            pledged to slash America's dependence on overseas oil. &quot;Our goal is 
            to promote energy independence for our country,&quot; he told Americans. 
            For a country that is the world's number one energy consumer - and 
            Saudi Arabia's biggest customer - the implication is clear. <br>
            At the Washington hydrogen convention, the President was at pains to 
            demonstrate his enthusiasm for the fuel - and its potential to 
            replace oil. He posed using a hydrogen-powered mobile phone, and sat 
            behind the wheel of a hydrogen-powered car. <br>
            &quot;Hydrogen fuel cells represent one of the most encouraging, 
            innovative technologies of our era,&quot; said the President. &quot;And as I 
            said in my State of the Union address, the idea is to see that a 
            child born today will be driving a car which will be powered by 
            hydrogen.&quot; <br>
            He added: &quot;It won't be easy to get there because there are 
            obstacles. But I wouldn't be proposing this initiative if I didn't 
            think we could overcome the obstacles.&quot; If hydrogen does become 
            commercially viable, oil reserves could become worthless almost 
            overnight. <br>
            So much for the first, hi-tech threat to the Gulf's flow of 
            petrodollars. The second is closer to home and very much 'old 
            economy', but no less real. On February 11, 2003 British oil major 
            BP announced a massive US$6.75 billion oil development programme in 
            Russia, with local partner TNK/Sidanco. The bold move hammers home 
            the industrial world's resolve to find alternative sources of oil 
            outside the Middle East, should innovations such as hydrogen fail to 
            make it off the drawing board. <br>
            &quot;We believe this to be a great moment in the history of BP and of 
            TNK/Sidanco and, indeed, an important milestone in the history of 
            the industry,&quot; said BP chairman Lord Browne. <br>
            Until recently, oil majors were wary about major investments in 
            Russia. They feared that the oil was too expensive to produce, and 
            that Russia's political and economic instability posed too great a 
            risk. This was good news for Middle East producers, whose oil is 
            much cheaper to extract and who - for all their political 
            shenanigans - oil majors have come to trust over the past 100 years.
            <br>
            Now, that unique position is evaporating, as BP chairman Lord Browne 
            was keen to stress. &quot;BP entered Russia five years ago when we bought 
            ten per cent of Sidanco. We had a tough time initially, but after 
            the present management and ownership structure was established early 
            in 2001 we have... learned a great deal about doing business in 
            Russia.&quot; <br>
            He added, &quot;These prudent measures, combined with Russia's greatly 
            improved economic stability, improved legal system and increasing 
            commitment to international rules of trade and business, have 
            convinced BP that now is the time to deepen our partnership with 
            (Russia).&quot; <br>
            So where does this leave Gulf oil producers? Reassuringly for them, 
            still sitting pretty. Hydrogen and Russia do indeed pose a threat. 
            But rulers in Riyadh, Kuwait City and Abu Dhabi have every right to 
            feel comfortable with the level of risk. <br>
            On hydrogen, scientists are still a million miles away from making 
            it competitive. Car manufacturers are ploughing billions of dollars 
            into research, particularly Japanese companies, but all admit they 
            are a long way from finding a viable replacement for petrol and 
            diesel.<br>
            Environmentalists have laughed off President Bush's commitment to 
            hydrogen. They say his US$1.2 billion pledge is a drop in the ocean 
            - it cost Ford Motor Company almost twice that to develop a new 
            model of its petrol powered Taurus car. Furthermore, they argue that 
            President Bush has withdrawn key legislation punishing high vehicle 
            emissions. <br>
            &quot;President Bush's new, 'big' idea allows this former Texas oil man 
            to give the auto and oil industries exactly what they want - an 
            opportunity to continue to profit from highly inefficient, polluting 
            cars,&quot; said Dr. Brent Blackwelder, president of the conservation 
            group Friends of the Earth. &quot;Any increase in funding for cleaner 
            cars must be viewed as part of a much broader budget context that is 
            terrible news for the environment.&quot; President Bush is remembered as 
            the president who effectively pulled America out of the Kyoto 
            Protocol on global warming, on the grounds that it would hurt the US 
            economy. Hardly the actions of man committed to green energy. <br>
            As for Russia, current evidence strongly suggests that its reserves 
            are a mere 10 per cent of those found in the Middle East. According 
            to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2002 (see chart), 
            Middle East proven oil reserves total 686 billion barrels, compared 
            to just 65 billion in the entire Former Soviet Union. <br>
            Clearly, Gulf oil producers do have something of a fight on their 
            hands. But they are still the toughest kids on the block. <br>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Flashback </b><br>
            My tenure with IBM began in France in 1966 when I joined their 
            marketing department soon after completing my Diploma in 
            Engineering. Since then I've been with the company, and have moved 
            up the ladder to become the manager. I was posted to a different 
            country every three years with the result that I have lived almost 
            all over the world. I was managing IBM Global Services in Moscow 
            before taking over as the general manager of Gulf Business Machines 
            (GBM) Oman in January 2001. <br>
            <br>
            <b>The company </b><br>
            GBM Oman was set up in 1990 as the general marketing and services 
            reseller of IBM. It is the extended arm of IBM and one of the six 
            companies across the gulf. Though each one of them is an independent 
            unit, there is a synergy between them and we work under the guidance 
            of our headoffice in Dubai. Conducting business in Oman is 
            challenging, and I love every moment of it here. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Management philosophy </b><br>
            Professionalism is our byword and it percolates down to the most 
            basic operation. Our organisation centres around our customers. We 
            feel responsible to each one of them and we always work towards 
            evoking their total trust. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Employee management </b><br>
            Our organisation draws its strength from its staff. We keep them 
            well motivated and are also constantly seeking promising young 
            locals to join our team. We have attained 30 per cent Omanisation.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Leadership style</b><br>
            I believe I have a mission here. I want to impart all my expertise 
            and experience to my staff and educate each and every employee on 
            how best to manage business. I firmly believe that one should feel 
            the company as his own and not merely run it as an employee. I am 
            accessible to all my people with my open door policy. Normally, when 
            I want to have a word with any of my staff I never call him to my 
            office instead I go over to his seat. This gives me and opportunity 
            to walk around the office and observe things. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest achievement </b><br>
            I get a sense of achievement each time I am promoted and given 
            additional responsibilities. I enjoy responsibilities. Every step 
            forward that IÕve taken is a big achievement. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest mistake </b><br>
            I have of course made mistakes for it is impossible to be a 
            zero-error person. But luckily there have been no blunders. I also 
            realise my mistake quickly and I never them. If I am in doubt 
            regarding a decision I consult others so as to minimise the 
            possibility of errors. <br>
            <br>
            <b>My strength</b><br>
            I have total conviction about what I do. I only do what I think is 
            right and I am capable of effectively convincing others. I am also 
            willing to listen to others and I accept criticism. I never impose 
            my decisions unilaterally on others and I am always open to 
            discussions. <br>
            <br>
            <b>My weakness</b> <br>
            I like people and therefore never want to hurt anyone. However, 
            business does not allow me to always be nice and I find it difficult 
            to cope with situations that require me to be unpleasant. I know 
            leniency is not a good managerial trait, despite which I always give 
            people a second chance. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Success formula</b><br>
            I am very close to my staff and this helps me to understand their 
            problems. Over the years I have also acquired the ability to predict 
            potential problems, especially people related ones, and so I am 
            usually able to pre-empt them. I also ensure that everyone is made a 
            part of the team and I subscribe to the 'right person at the right 
            place' policy. If someone is disenchanted with his job his 
            discontentment not only affects the productivity it also kills the 
            team spirit. I am always truthful with people and never mislead them 
            so that they trust me totally.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest regret </b><br>
            I have no regrets. I am a very positive and happy person and I 
            always see only the silver lining never the clouds. There are always 
            two or more ways of viewing any situation and I always choose the 
            brighter one. For example I adore my grandchildren and love being 
            with them but since they live in France I don't get to do so too 
            often. Instead of brooding about that I feel happy that I am able to 
            invite them to Oman. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Balancing home and work </b><br>
            At home my wife is the leader and I have very happily surrendered 
            all the domestic responsibilities to her. I never take work home and 
            I also try not to allow my work pressure to affect my personal life.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Motivation </b><br>
            The desire to make people happy be it my customers, employees or 
            family makes me go that extra mile. I have always wanted to lead a 
            team and that leadership instinct has pushed me forward. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Competition <br>
            </b>Competition does not intimidate me. Healthy competition brings 
            out the best in one and shakes you out of complacency. I respect my 
            competitors.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tips for aspiring leaders </b><br>
            Always work as a team and lead by example. Manage the organisation 
            with an entrepreneurial spirit putting others before self. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Future plans </b><br>
            I am not exactly too young. This could probably be my last 
            assignment before retirement and I of course intend to contribute to 
            the best of my abilities as I have always been doing. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Family<br>
            </b>I am very happily married to Francoise for 37 years. My wife 
            gave up a promising career as a scientist to get married and I will 
            always appreciate her sacrifice. She is now very active in the 
            social circuit. We have two children. Our daughter (35) is married 
            and lives in France and our son (33) lives in the UK. We have two 
            grandchildren. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Hobbies</b><br>
            Oman is a spectacularly beautiful country and is really an 
            explorer's delight with its varied landscape. I love travelling 
            around the country in my car. I am also a motorbike enthusiast. I am 
            a sports buff and was into competitive swimming at the national 
            levels earlier. I also enjoy squash and tennis. </font></p>

</font><b><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 16pt">GCC stock markets: What 
next?</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
<br>
It’s not all that scary, says OER columnist Matein Khalid, on the latest crash 
of the GCC stock markets
</b><br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="periscope.jpg" align="left" width="96" height="120" hspace="5"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">n 
retrospect, the global emerging market sell off echoes the earlier falls in the GCC markets. Egypt has become a casualty of the latest Wall Street grizzly 
jitters, as the most widely foreign owned Arab stock market. Market panics tend 
to be indiscriminate. Money managers often sell because they must; they sell 
what they can, not what they must.<br>
This naturally means that large, liquidity bellwether shares often become 
victims of a foreign fund manager’s desperation to reduce country exposure or a 
margin call elsewhere in the region. Cross-national capital flows in the GCC 
have also led to a dramatic increase in pan-GCC coefficients of correlations, 
particularly on the downside.<br>
<br>
<b>Saudi Arabia: </b>While the Saudi Tadawul index has risen to 12,000, 
valuations in the kingdom are still excessive. For example, it is absurd that 
Saudi banks still trade at six times book value and 25 times earnings, totally 
out of sync with bank share valuations metrics anywhere in the world. The one 
exception is Riyadh Bank, where a 2.6 per cent dividend yield offers some 
cushion. I also believe Saudi Telecom is overvalued at SR 112, even though it 
has fallen significantly from its SR 193 high. With a market cap of US$60 
billion, Saudi Telecom sports a 18 price/earnings multiple though its yield at 
4.7 per cent is treble that of the Saudi banks.<br>
<br>
<b>Kuwait: </b>I am bullish on Kuwaiti banks at 12-14 times earnings, 
particularly NBK, which has a 30 per cent market share in loans and deposits in 
an oligopolistic, though extremely profitable, banking market. It is important 
to limit Kuwaiti exposure to liquid, first tier large caps such as NBK, Burgan 
Bank, Kuwait Finance House or the two telecoms (MTC, Wataniya).<br>
<br>
<b>Qatar: </b>Qatar is still too speculative at its current value levels though 
I am bullish on Solidiere GDR at 22 as a play on Beirut property purchases to 
GCC investors. Q-Tel at QR 200 does offer a forward multiple of 10 and a natural 
monopoly as the Emirate is simply too small to interest a global telecom 
operator.<br>
<br>
<b>Oman:</b> In Oman, BankMuscat is a reasonable proxy for the banking sector 
and an economy whose growth drivers are highly correlated to high oil prices.</font></p>

      <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Omani shares have reflected the bearish sentiment and declining turnover in the 
GCC, Arab and emerging markets stock exchanges, with the MSM almost 800 points 
below its 2006 high and now in the red YTD. Yet the fall in the Omani stock 
      market has now been as traumatic as that of say, Qatar or Dubai, 
      reflecting more realistic valuations and lower “irrational exuberance”, 
      itself a function of leveraged speculation and bank credit growth.</font></td>

</div>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">This is a testament to the 
sophisticated market surveillance infrastructure of the MSM as well as the 
conservative monetary vigilance of the central bank, which understands the 
danger of liquidity driven asset bubbles all too well.<br>
<br>
Of course, the MSM was collateral damage to the meltdown in the broader GCC and 
Arab equities markets. Capital flows from the GCC, particularly the UAE, recedes 
as investors scrambled to meet margin calls. Of course, as elsewhere in the AGCC, 
there is a disconnect between the stock market and the macroeconomic prospect of 
the Sultanate, with IMF projections of six percent GDP growth amid record high 
oil prices. This is the time to rotate into large cap, illiquid value shares in 
telecom, cement and banking, the ones favoured by pension funds and GCC fund 
managers. This necessarily suggests are overweight in BankMuscat, Rasyut Cement 
and Omantel. The margin call triggered selling panic is now over and the search 
for value cannot be far away.<br>
<br>
<b>UAE:</b> The UAE stock markets are trapped in a listless trading range after the 
traumatic sell offs in March, punctuated by periodic speculative rallies such as 
that which caused the shares of Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank to double for no credible 
reasons. The technical deterioration in the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) means 
that support at 430 is critical or the market could well do a kamikaze dive to 
new lows. Volumes have, as usually happens in Gulf bear markets, plummeted on 
both the ADSM and DFM.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that ostensibly lower valuations do not seem to attract 
institutional investors, even in liquid blue chips such as Emaar that has been 
unable to rise above 12 Dirhams on a sustainable basis. Higher interest rates, 
tangibly soft UAE property sale markets and ambiguities over margins on its 
global projects compounded with the inevitable selling pressure from trapped 
longs make it impossible to expect a sustainable rally in Emaar, the bellwether 
share that dominates the Dubai Financial Market.<br>
<br>
The prospects for UAE banks are equally problematic. Valuations on most banks 
are excessive for a post-bubble world with rising interest rates in some of the 
most hyper competitive banking markets on earth. Even First Gulf and UNB, the 
cheapest Abu Dhabi banks, trade at two times book value. The IPO bonanza is 
over, hurting earnings growth. Q2 profit reports do not seem encouraging as 
banks were at the epicenter of the neutron bomb that fell on the stock markets, 
which have lost 60 per cent of their market cap <br>
since October.<br>
<br>
Banks usually learn the hard way that lending for share speculation usually has 
a nemesis in credit shock bombshell and rising provisions that restrain future 
profit growth. The existence of Emaar, the large cap listed banks and insurance 
companies mean that the UAE stock market is one of the most interest rate 
sensitive markets on the earth, akin to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index.<br>
<br>
So I seek shares without capital markets exposure or dubious and non-recurrent 
earnings, major liquidity risk, high beta to the index for UAE equities 
exposure. This leads naturally to Etisilat, which I would buy below AED 14 or a 
modest forward valuation multiple of 11. Its franchise ironically benefits from 
higher interest rates because Etisilat’s treasury routinely invests billions in 
excess cash in the money markets. <br>
<br>
Etisilat has a solid balance sheet and, unlike Western telcos, no debt 
liabilities. Its EPS trends still promises 20 per cent growth, as its de facto 
UAE monopoly is still a cash cow. Pakistan will be a future growth engine and 
its Mobily subscriber adds make its Saudi Arabian venture a clear winner. I 
believe Etisilat is headed to AED 20.</font></p>

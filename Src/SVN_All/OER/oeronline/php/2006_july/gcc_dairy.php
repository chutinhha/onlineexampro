potential</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>
<b>Gulf states are banking on the tourism industry with a view to diversifying 
their economies</b><br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="gcc_dairy_1.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="102" hspace="5"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>T</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">o 
reduce the dependency on oil revenues, Gulf countries are concentrating on 
developing other sectors, especially the tourism industry. More than inbound, 
it’s the outbound tourism market that is flourishing in the region.<br>
<br>
According to the World Tourism Organization, Arab tourists from the Gulf States 
alone spend over US$12 billion on overseas vacations — a very lucrative market. 
Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest outbound markets with tourists from the 
kingdom spending US$6.7 billion annually on overseas travel, which is about 5 
per cent of the country’s GDP. And UAE travelers alone spend over US$4.9 
billion, an average of US$1,700 per trip, which is US$500 higher than the 
European average.<br>
<br>
Looking at the growing demand in the region, as many as six national tourism 
boards from Europe, Asia and Africa have started their Middle East operations 
from Dubai. Followed by Germany, Turkey, Cyprus, Singapore, Malaysia and Morocco 
have all set up shop in Dubai.<br>
<br>
But slowly Gulf countries also are taking pains to attract international 
tourists other than its region. To start with, the Kuwaiti government framed a 
National Tourism strategy to pep up tourism contribution to its GDP. Currently, 
tourism only contributes 1.9 per cent of Kuwait’s GDP. But efforts are being 
made to increase tourism contribution to GDP to 2.9 per cent by 2025, cutting by 
10 per cent, the amount of money Kuwaitis spend annually on tourism outside the 
country. By 2010, the strategy envisages an increase in the number of tourists 
visiting Kuwait to one million per year. This would represent an overall 
increase in tourism numbers of 25 per cent by 2010. <br>
<br>
Saudi Arabia is concentrating on religious tourism. The Supreme Commission for 
Tourism is trying to remove obstacles for foreign tourists to visit the country. 
It has started offering pilgrim visas for over seven months of the year. Not 
just Jeddah but other places like Mecca, Medina, Yanbu and Al Khobar are also 
being given equal priority for tourism development.<br>
<br>
Bahrain, once known as the Pearl of the Gulf, is trying to reinvent itself. 
Tourism industry currently contributes 9 to 10 per cent of the Gross National 
Product. The government is trying to increase it to 20 per cent in coming years. 
The Tourism Affairs department is working hard to improve the inbound tourism.
<br>
<br>
A majority of the Bahrain tourists — about 80 per cent — are from the 
neighbouring Gulf countries. In 2004, five million tourists visited the country. 
The government aims to increase this number to seven million by 2010. The 
efforts of Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in this regard have 
proved fruitful till now. He has ably used Grand Prix Formula One race to 
promote and boost the tourism sector in the Kingdom. In 2005, the Grand Prix had 
more than 77,257 visitors, 54 per cent of them from Bahrain, 25 per cent from 
the GCC region and a further 20 per cent being international visitors, many from 
the wider Middle East. <br>
<br>
Bahrain’s location gives it an advantage for tourism inflow from Saudi Arabia. 
But it has to improve inbound tourists from outside the region. Formula One race 
is one such opportunity for the country to attract international tourists.<br>
<br>
The Qatar government, on the other hand, framed a Tourism National Plan to 
double the number of visitors from 500,000 in 2004 to one million by 2010. Qatar 
is a less preferred tourist destination in the region. However, Qatar Tourism 
Authority projects that the number of tourists will double from the current rate 
of 700,000 per year to 1.4 million by 2010. To achieve the target, Qatar has 
envisaged its tourism plan around sport events. Grand Prix — motorcycling race, 
Qatar Golf tournment, Tennis open and Squash tournment and many other events are 
expected to attract tourists to this country. The 15th Asian Games, to be held 
in December 2006, are expected to draw a large number of visitors.<br>
<br>
Coming to Oman, 85 per cent of its tourists come from the UAE. To attract 
tourists from places other than the UAE, the Sultanate is taking help of 
professionals. It appointed Dubai based Fusion Marketing to promote and create a 
brand image for Oman. Popular for its culture, Oman is basing its tourism 
strategy on festivals. Salalah Khareef Festival is one such major event promoted 
to attract visitors during summer. But again, this festival attracted 88 per 
cent of its tourists from the GCC countries only. The Ministry of Tourism of the 
Sultanate has chalked out very ambitious targets to achieve a growth from 
current 0.9 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent in the tourism industry by 2020.<br>
<br>
Finally, the UAE undoubtedly leads the tourism industry in the Gulf region. With 
a variety of events — sports, leisure and entertainment, the UAE is able to 
attract a large number of visitors than other GCC states. Surprisingly, this 
number is not only sustaining but also increasing year after year.<br>
<br>
Dubai’s mega projects such as Dubailand, the Waterfront, Palm Islands and 
Festival City will help in increasing the number of visitors by 7.2 per cent 
annually till 2015, taking the number to 14 million, according to World Travel 
and Tourism Council. If Dubai turned into a ‘Mecca of Shopping’, the other 
Emirates of UAE, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Sharjah, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah have 
become major tourist attractions for heritage, architecture and landscapes.<br>

The Kuwaiti government is studying a proposal to introduce income tax for the 
first time in the country. The new law would impose a flat rate tax of 10 per 
cent on all earners, irrespective of their nationality. The draft law is set to 
be studied by the Cabinet and then possibly referred to the next session of 
Parliament.<br>
<br>
A comprehensive draft law prepared with inputs from a Dutch financial 
institution was already sent to the Cabinet for review. The law aims at 
restructring public finances and supporting economic development.<br>
<br>
“Financial and economic reform cannot be achieved without developing the tax 
system similarly to what is being applied in both industrial and developing 
countries,” Finance minister Bader Al Humaidhi told the Cabinet recently.<br>
<br>
Currently, individuals — either Kuwaitis or foreigners — are not subject to 
taxes on income. Besides, Kuwaiti firms enjoy no tax regime. However, foreign 
companies engaged in commercial activities in Kuwait are subjected to income 
tax. Recently a bill was approved by the Cabinet that slashed tax on foreign 
firms to a flat 15 per cent from current levels of up to 55 per cent. The new 
income tax law is expected to be referred to Parliament after the election of a 
new Assembly on June 29.<br>

Trade between UAE and the European Union (EU) grew by 29 per cent for the first 
quarter of this year to US$10.2 billion compared to nearly US$7.958 billion for 
the corresponding period last year. According to the latest EU statistics, UAE’s 
exports to the EU grew by 10.9 per cent. The total value of these exports rose 
from US$2.02 billion to US$2.24 billion. The total value of imports from the EU 
grew by 34.5 per cent, from US$5.93 billion for the first quarter of 2005 to 
US$7.99 billion for the first quarter of this year.<br>
<br>
The total trade between the UAE and the EU countries grew by 54 per cent to 
US$44.75 billion last year compared to nearly US$30.62 billion in 2004. The 
trade deficit of UAE with the EU rose by nearly 15 per cent in 2005. The total 
volume of deficit hit US$19.62 billion in 2005, up from US$17.06 billion in 
2004.<br>
<br>
The UAE ranked eighth among the biggest exporters to the EU last year and 16th 
among the most significant commercial partners of the EU for the same year. The 
UAE’s share in the EU’s total exports hit 2.38 per cent in 2005, rendering UAE 
in the 25th place among the biggest importers from the EU.<br>
<br>
Statistics show that UAE’s exports to the EU grew by 85.4 per cent from US$6.78 
billion in 2004 to US$ 12.567 billion while imports grew by 35 per cent to US$ 
32.83 billion in 2005 compared to nearly US$23.84 billion in 2004.<br>
<br>
According to the EU, the overall trade with UAE grows at an annual average of no 
less than 20 per cent while the average growth of UAE’s imports hits 15.8 per

value of the exports of manufactured products touched nearly US$1.91 billion. 
Transport equipment and machinery also had the lion’s share of UAE’s total 
imports from the EU. The share of these imports touched nearly 62.5 per cent and 
their value reached US$20.14 billion.<br>
<br>
According to the trade statistics, UK made major contribution to the growth of 
UAE’s exports, posting an increase in exports of 87 per cent. The other country 
that made significant contribution is Finland with 46 per cent. On the other 
hand, exports of France declined by 25 per cent while those of the other

Jubail Industrial City is getting ready to soon host a number of petrochemical 
and infrastructure projects worth more than US$21.6 billion. The second 
industrial city, Jubail-II, is ready for inauguration.<br>
<br>
The Jubail-II project, covering an area of 1,950 hectares, is expected to 
attract investment projects worth US$58.66 billion. While describing the Jubail 
Industrial City as the largest engineering project in the world, Prince Saud ibn 
Abdullah ibn Thunayan said Jubail-II would provide an expansion facility for the 
industrialization of the city for the next 25 to 30 years.<br>
Jubail project was opened in December 2004. Many new petrochemical, oil and 
infrastructure projects are coming up in Jubail-II, which is expected to create 
some 55,000 job opportunities. Other projects that are in the pipeline include 
the Butanediol plant of the Saudi International Petrochemical Company (SIPCHEM). 
The plant, the first of its kind in the Middle East, has an annual capacity of 
75,000 tons. SIPCHEM recently signed a US$1.06 billion contract with a 
consortium of Canadian, German and French firms for the construction of acetic 
acid and vinyl acetate plants in Jubail. It will have an annual production 
capacity of 460,000 tons.<br>
<br>
The King will also launch the US$21.33 million expressway, linking the present 
industrial city with Jubail-II. <br>
<br>
Other projects to be initiated by the King include a US$97.06 million port and 
wharf for petrochemicals at King Fahd Industrial Port covering an area of 
800,000 sq mt, development of the Jalmouda neighborhood at a cost of US$65.06 
million and a housing project to build 621 housing units for the employees of 
the Royal Commission at a cost of US$115.46 million.<br>
<br>
King Abdullah will also kick off the expansion of the Royal Commission Hospital 
costing US$18.66 million, the National Industrial Gas Company project, which 
requires investments worth US$253.33 million and the Eastern Petrochemical 
Company project (Sharq) at a cost of US$3.48 billion.<br>
<br>
Other projects expected to take off include the United Petrochemical Company, 
with an investment of US$373 million, the Saudi Iron &amp; Steel Company (Hadeed) 
with an investment of US$300 million and the Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Company (SAFCO) 
involving an investment of US$541 million.<br>

Al Rayan Bank was listed on the Doha Securities Market (DSM) on June 19, with 
its shares opening at QR18 (RO1=approx. QR9.40). Many of the GCC investors 
described the listing price as low. The Rayyan IPO earlier this year was one of 
the biggest the region had seen, and its listing on the DSM was viewed as a road 
to overnight riches, by investors across the Gulf.<br>
<br>
Most of the investors were expecting the opening price to be at least between 
QR50 and QR60. Many of the GCC investors felt this was not worth the effort they 
had taken in coming to Qatar. However, some of the investors justified this 
pricing, saying it would benefit long-term and serious investors.<br>
<br>
At a press conference after the listing of the share, the Chairman of Al Rayan 
Bank’s board, Dr Hussain Al Abdullah, justified the price saying it reflected 
the bank’s long-term prospects. “Long-term investors would prefer this price 
level,” he said, arguing that had the price been higher, it would have led to 
speculative trading. <br>
<br>
Some of the investors agreed with this view as they felt that at this price 
level there would not be much selling pressure, thus lending stability to the 
shares. They were of the view that this price was good to buy but not to sell.<br>
<br>
According to informed sources, it were mostly the GCC investors who had placed 
sell orders and they had specified ‘market price’ as the offer price for sale 
and this led to the opening price being low. <br>
<br>
There were many who quoted offer prices at between QR10 and QR15. However, not 
all GCC investors, who had descended in Doha in large numbers for the historic 
event, were in favour of selling the shares. <br>
<br>
<b>International Firm Hired</b><br>
A US-based international consultancy has been hired to help set up the 
multi-billion dollar Al Rayan Bank, which is tipped to be the largest Islamic 
bank in the Middle East. <br>
<br>
Mercer Oliver Wyman is conducting studies in two phases to facilitate the QR7.5 
billion bank’s launch. At the end of phase one, the bank will become 
operational, offering different services and products and with an extensive 
strategy and identity of the bank. The second phase of the study would focus on 
developing these products and services. “We are going to offer the services and 
products no other bank in the region is so far offering,” said Al Abdullah. The 
bank will open branches in the rest of the GCC. <br>
<br>
Most of the banks in the region are focusing on the West and Al Rayan will be 
the first to pay attention to venture capital and real estate, mainly in Asian 
countries like Japan, Korea and Malaysia and the emerging markets like China and 
India, he said.<br>
<br>
Al Rayan Bank also hopes to soon launch an investment bank via the Qatar 
Financial Centre (QFC) by September or October this year, according to the 
chairman of the bank’s board, Dr Hussain Al Abdullah. The bank will focus on 
venture capital, asset management and real estate in the emerging markets in 
Asia and other Asian countries.<br>

<br>
<img border="0" src="gccdairy_bahrain.jpg" width="200" height="51"><br>
In their efforts to further integrate their economies, Qatar and Bahrain are 
virtually racing against time. In June, authorities of both countries took some 
extraordinary steps designed to strengthen economic ties. The two countries 
signed wide-ranging contracts, including — notably — construction of a 
long-awaited causeway. The 40-km structure aims to link north-western Qatar to 
south-eastern Bahrain. <br>
<br>
The project is estimated to cost some US$3 billion, borne equally by the two 
governments. The two countries can absorb the funding on the back of firm oil 
prices in international markets. The petroleum sector accounts for three 
quarters of treasury income in both Qatar and Bahrain.<br>
<br>
Tenders related to construction parts of the causeway are due to be issued 
during the summer, with contracts to be granted by year-end. If everything goes 
according to the plan, the causeway should become operational by 2011. <br>
<br>
The link should bring economic benefits to both nations and particularly to the 
smaller Bahrain. Benefits include invigorating local economies, strengthening 
trade relations and enhancing integration among GCC countries. All such efforts 
can lead to stronger levels of growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) of 
Qatar and Bahrain.<br>
<br>
<b>Stimulating Economic Activities <br>
</b><br>
To begin with, local economies of both countries stand to benefit from spending 
on the project. Each country is scheduled to spend some US$1.5 billion over a 
span of four years, the period needed to accomplish the scheme. Undoubtedly, the 
GDPs would benefit from this sizeable amount, with funds finding way to 
different contractors. Then, there is the multiplier effect. Traditionally, each 
dollar spent generates more than three dollars in the economies of both Qatar 
and Bahrain.<br>
<br>
<b>Improving Trade Relations <br>
</b><br>
The link would certainly assist in increasing the level of bilateral trade. At 
the moment, Bahrain enjoys trade surplus with Qatar. In 2005, the value of 
Bahraini exports amounted to more than US$106 million. This is a sizeable 
amount, as it comprised nearly 5 per cent of Bahrain’s non-oil exports. Yet, the 
value of imports from Qatar amounted to merely US$20 million last year. 
Eventually, the causeway would open up prospects for further trade by making it 
easy for enterprises to engage in trading activities. Already, there are talks 
of Qatar’s industrial projects such as steel finding easier ways to reach the 
Bahraini market. For Bahrain, the causeway provides easy access to the region’s 
fastest growing economy. Qatar’s gross economy grew by more than 30 per cent in 
nominal terms in 2005 (but less in real terms, reflecting inflationary 
pressures). <br>
<br>
<b>Creating Job Opportunities <br>
</b><br>
Improved trade relation helps in keeping some jobs while creating new ones. To 
be sure, the link can provide an avenue for Bahraini nationals looking for 
employment opportunities in Qatar. Bahraini workers possess certain skills, 
including the ability to communicate in English. Unemployment is a serious 
problem in Bahrain (some 14,000 locals have registered themselves as jobless 
under the newly launched National Employment Programme). The figure represents 
nearly 11 per cent of the local workforce. For its part, the Qatari economy 
needs qualified workers, who in turn share local culture. Of all GCC countries, 
the Qatari and Bahraini societies are linked by strong family ties, thanks to 
inter-marriages. <br>
<b><br>
Integrating GCC Economies <br>
</b><br>
Last but not least, the link falls in line with the broader goal of achieving 
economic integration among regional states, the GCC, of which both Qatar and 
Bahrain are members. The GCC aims to become a common market by the end of 2007. 
In turn, this necessitates granting unrestricted access to factors of production 
of member states. Thus, the causeway fulfils a strategic goal of GCC states. <br>
<br>
Qatar’s size stands at 11,437 sq km, which is 16 times larger than that of 
Bahrain. Also, Qatar’s GDP is more than twice the size of that of Bahrain. Yet, 
the causeway would link and bind the two countries and economies once and 
forever. </font></p>

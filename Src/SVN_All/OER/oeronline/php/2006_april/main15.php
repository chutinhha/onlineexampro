OER traces the favorite pastimes of Wael Ahmed Al Lawati, the acting CEO of The 
Wave project</b><br>

appearances can be deceptive. Take the case of Wael Ahmed Al Lawati. Neither his 
handshake nor his looks give the hints of the steely nerves he possesses. The 
prestigious mega million project — The Wave of Muscat — that he is managing, 
brings with it huge responsibility and the inevitable tension. But nothing shows 
on his face. He disarms his friends and detractors with his “killer smile”. How 
does this acting Chief Executive Officer manage to hide his tensions?<br>
<br>
“Tension? What’s that?” he quips. On realizing that the question is just a 
conversational gambit, Lawati loosens up a bit and talks eloquently about the 
inevitability of business and associated tension. For the first time, one is 
able to discern the seriousness he attaches to the concept of unwinding in the 
competitive world. <br>
<br>
If Lawati is to be believed — you better do that! — reading is his hobby. A 
pastime, or “whatever you wish to call it”. Suddenly, it dawns upon him that it 
has been quite sometime that he has laid his hands on any book. He looks around 
sheepishly. “Where is the time to sit in a quiet corner and flip through the 
book? The office work eats into daily life as well,” he confesses. <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, squash was his pastime. Once upon a time, he hastens to add. “It 
was a great stress buster and reliever. I developed an interest in squash 16 
years ago when I was in college. I used to look upon squash for another reason 
as well... College days and rivalry with the peer group go together. I was no 
exception. Can I afford to hit my rivals? No way! That is where, I used to hit 
the wall with the same ferocity and take vicarious pleasure,” reveals Lawati.<br>
<br>
A 30-minute daily workout at Malaton Club, now part of Hyatt, was his regular 
hangout for years, recollects the Wave acting CEO. Sweet memories of the friends 
he used to hang out with, sweep him off his feet as he walks down the memory 
lane. His tryst with squash continued until he left the Omani shores for higher 
studies.<br>
<br>
For a while, like a typical Omani, he was fascinated by football. He used to 
play once a week. “The biggest problem was getting a critical mass to play 
football. Moreover, it becomes uncomfortable playing in summers. There was no 
fun,” says Lawati. Yet, he carried his love for football overseas. He used to 
play football five days a week. “Yes, five days a week,” he swears. “I was a 
great sport... Today, there is very little time for any serious play,” adds he.<br>
<br>
In the midst of talking about his dalliance with snooker, Lawati breaks off on a 
tangent to describe the aggressively fought football games at home and abroad. 
Lawati’s love affair with football came to an end when he broke his ankle. What 
a pity! “On court, we fight like ferocious animals. Off court, we are just 
friends. If you watch me on court those days, you would have seen a different 
personality,” boasts Lawati. Before breaking his ankle, at the Sussex 
University, he tried to dabble in indoor football for a short while.<br>
<br>
It is understandable that his corporate life hardly leaves time for anything 
else. Does it mean he has no time for any pastime these days? “Not advisable,” 
he chuckles. “Now, I have taken up walking on the beach. But walking abroad is 
more fun. There is no infrastructure in Oman. The city is meant for automotives. 
Not meant for pedestrians! There are sewers on the road and pathways,” Lawati 
rues.<br>
<br>
So, what is Lawati’s walking strategy? Does he walk the talk? “Cent percent”, he 
hastens to add. Walking on the beach in Muscat is the best option — twice a week 
for a stretch of 5 km. What is the inspiration? His wife, he admits. She walks 
almost daily. Lawati does not have that luxury. “I wish I could,” he adds. <br>
<br>
So what would the goal be if he were to be granted that luxury? “Forget about 
getting relieved of the tension. I can think and walk. Moreover, I will be able 
to tuck in my bulging tummy,” he says even while his palm tries to pat the 
invisible torso. <br>

day is approaching when one might reach Sohar in less than 30 minutes! Serious 
plans are afoot for the construction of an airport in Sohar. The tender inviting 
bids from multinational firms to offer consultancy services for the 
multi-million Rials airport is already out. <br>
<br>
The next few weeks are going to be hectic for prospective bidders as well as the 
Ministry of Transport and Communication that will oversee this massive exercise. 
Ever since the government declared its intentions to set up three new airports — 
at Sohar, Duqum and Ras al Hadd — the officials are burning the proverbial 
midnight oil outlining the details for the proposed airport at Sohar among other 
places.<br>
<br>
Given the pace at which the Sohar Port City and Sohar Industrial Estate are 
shaping up — involving huge foreign direct investment from global giants drawn 
from several corners of the world — an airport in Sohar has become a necessity. 
Though a well-maintained road provides excellent linkage, the three-hour ride is 
viewed as excessive. Sohar, once the capital of Oman and the historical shipping 
hub between east and west is coming back to life thanks to new projects which 
are in varied stages of planning and completion. <br>
<br>
“An airport will be a boon,” says Premchandran of Al Khaleej Polypropolene. For 
many operating out of Sohar, the proposed air link is not a luxury but a 
necessity. While it may take anywhere between 24-36 months for an airport to 
become fully functional, a basic runaway, with a fully equipped control tower, 
can be put together much faster. <br>
<br>
There is a market for a helicopter service between Muscat and Sohar. Many global 
giants, engaged in building their respective manufacturing plants, could easily 
make provisions for a helipad atop their own premises. But the issue at stake is 
a general airstrip, which can service all kinds of flights — and not just 
helicopters and small aircraft. In light of the fact that most of the operators 
touching Seeb International (Muscat) will look to touching down at Sohar as well 
if the traffic is good. Since Sohar will be catering to the business community, 
airfare is a no issue. Oman Air and Gulf Air may be the frontrunners given their 
heightened stake and interest in the Sultanate. <br>
<br>
While Seeb International Airport will continue to remain the main gateway to the 
Sultanate, Sohar airport — as and when it materializes — is bound to draw 
business traffic given its orientation in contrast to the touristic Salalah 
airport. <br>
<br>
The prospective bidders for the Sohar airport are meant to pick up their tender 
forms in the first week of April and submit their bids four weeks later. A clear 
picture as to who has won the prestigious contract will become clear in the 
third quarter of the current financial year if all goes according to schedule. </font></p>

    Advanced mooring system for Salalah</b><br>
    New Zealand-based Mooring Systems Limited (MSL) has been awarded a contract 
    by Salalah Port Services (SPS) to supply mooring systems designed to 
    mitigate the effect of waves on container ships at berth during the khareef 
    season. Under the latest deal, MSL will supply four MoorMaster 600 units. 
    The units will be install ed and commissioned in June this year just before 
    the onset of the khareef season. <br>
    <br>
    It will provide four automated mooring units designed to secure some of the 
    largest container ships while at berth at the transshipment terminal. The 
    deal follows the successful trial of a pair of mooring units in Salalah last 
    year — the first time that MSL’s innovative systems have been tested at an 
    international container port. The objective of the trial was to evaluate the 
    impact of automated mooring within the port, as well as assess the 
    performance and ability of MSL’s mooring technology to dampen vessel 
    movements while moored with the systems.<br>
    <br>
    Vessels subjected to long waves and moored conventionally with ropes often 
    surge alongside the piers, a phenomenon generally witnessed during the 
    khareef season. This vessel motion adversely affects container transfer 
    rates and the productivity of the terminal and ships. However, ship motions 
    caused by long waves were substantially reduced with MSL’s automated mooring 
    units, even when deployed alongside vessels of 8,000 TEU capacity and 98,000 
    tonnes displacement.</font></td>

                <b>Mittal Steel vs.Arcelor</b><br>
                Steel king Lakshmi Mittal plans to press ahead with his takeover 
                bid of Arcelor, launching a syndicated loan of 8 bn euro (US$9.5 
                billion) despite the company’s single biggest shareholder 
                Luxembourg refusing to sell its 5.6 per cent stake. Luxembourg 
                prime minister Jean Claude Juncker Friday said he saw “no 
                foreseeable reason” why his country should sell the shares to 
                Mittal Steel. Bankers Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Societe 
                Generale, Commerzbank, CSFB and HSBC have launched the deal for 
                around 20 of Mittal’s relationship banks, which have been 
                invited to sub-underwrite the loan.<br>
                <br>
                The Luxembourg state is Arcelor’s biggest shareholder, with a 
                5.6 percent stake. Spanish businessman Jose Maria Aristrain is 
                the company’s second-largest shareholder, with a 3.5 percent 
                stake, and Belgium’s Walloon region owns 2.4 percent stake. 
                Arcelor is based in Luxembourg and has units in Belgium, France 
                and Spain. Mittal has been travelling across Europe recently 
                presenting his case for the takeover to governments in Brussels, 
                Madrid, Paris and Luxembourg.Mittal Steel, the world’s biggest 
                steel producer by output, has made a US$23 billion offer for 
                Arcelor.</font></p><hr width="90%" size="1">

                <img border="0" src="worldscan.jpg" width="114" height="28"></b><br>
                operating systemMicrosoft has delayed the long-awaited consumer 
                upgrade of its Windows operating system until January 2007, 
                delivering a severe blow to PC manufacturers, retailers and 
                chip-makers who had hoped to cash in this Christmas on the 
                firstupgrade in fiveyears.The postponement is the second time 
                Microsoft has pushed back the launch of Microsoft Vista. The 
                length of time between upgrades is unusually long for the 
                software group, which has in the past released new versions 
                every three or four years. The last time it upgraded the system 
                was with Windows XP in 2001.James Allchin, co-president of the 
                Windows division, said he had arrived at the decision to take a 
                few extra weeks after a meeting with the heads of the Windows 
                development team. He said there was a broad desire to push the 
                quality higher, especially in security.<br>
                <br>
                The company has hired outside firmsandaskedthem to try to hack 
                in to the new system.A successful launch of the upgrade is 
                crucial for Microsoft. Windows is loaded on to 90 per cent of 
                the world’s computers and remains the biggest revenue spinner 
                for the software firm.Thelaunchof Vista is expected to be the 
                biggest product launch in the technology industry since Windows 
                95, more than a decade ago.Allchin said: “We could have just 
                gone ahead, but I didn’t think it was the right thing to do. 
                We’re setting stringent quality bars on what we do. We needed 
                just a few more weeks.”Analysts said the delay would cause the 
                most pain for Microsoft’s partners.<br>
                <br>
                Gartner, said: “It’s a critical eight to 10 weeks for retailing 
                and for the producers. The retailers and the PC hardware 
                manufacturers work on razor-thin margins,so the impact there 
                could be pretty severe.”</font></p>

                </b><br>
                Nearly 100 airlines were banned from flyingtoairportsinthe 
                European Union because of safety concerns. Jacques Barrot, the 
                European transport commissioner, described some of their planes 
                as “flyingcoffins”andsaidsafetycontrols were too weak. None of 
                the airlines on the 92-strong blacklist currently operates in 
                Britain and most are already barred by the government. African 
                carriers account for the lion’s share of the list, along with 
                others from Afghanistan, North Korea, Thailand, Kazakhstan and 
                Kyrgyzstan. It includes 50 airlines from the Democratic Republic 
                of Congo, 14 from Sierra Leone, 11 from Equatorial Guinea, seven 
                from Swaziland and three from Liberia. Lesser restrictions were 
                placed on Air Bangladesh and Buraq Air from Libya, which will be 
                able to operate 
                flightsiftheyuseleasedplanesthatmeetsafetyrequirements.<br>
                <br>
                The list, which was drawn up following a spate of accidents, is 
                a pre-emptive strike because few of the airlines operate in 
                Europe. Barrot, who announced the 25-nation-wide ban, said: 
                “This blacklist will keep dubious airlines out of Europe. It 
                will also make sure that all airlines operating in Europe’s sky 
                meet the highest safety standards.” However, it advised 
                passengers to avoid travelling with the airlines elsewhere in 
                the world. Tour operators will be required to inform passengers 
                of the identity of the airline. Under the new rules, passengers 
                will also have a right to compensation if the airline on which 
                they were to flywasincludedontheblacklist or replaced by a 
                blacklisted airline after they bought the ticket. The list, 
                which will be reviewed every three months, was compiled from 
                those held by individual EU member states.</font></p></td>

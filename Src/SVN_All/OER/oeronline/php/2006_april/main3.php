and South Africa enjoy a close relationship. In order to aid the development of 
their economies, both the countries, are looking at forging a closer trade 
relationship. Currently, Oman’s imports from South Africa stands at RO7.5 
million while exports are pegged around RO4 million. <br>
<br>
South Africa is wooing Omani industry with a pro-active strategy. Senior 
government officials and corporate leaders from South Africa are coming to the 
Sultanate on a regular basis. Recently, to showcase the changing face of South 
Africa, the representatives from the leading publications of Oman were taken to 
South Africa on a familiarization trip.<br>
<br>
Last month, South African Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa led a 
delegation comprising of Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, Deputy Defence 
Minister Mluleki George, representatives from the departments of education, 
defence, environmental affairs, tourism and minerals &amp; energy to Oman. The 
delegation’s objective was to strengthen the economic and trade relations 
between the countries. <br>
<br>
The delegation held extensive talks with HE Minister of Commerce and Industry 
Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, HE Minister for Foreign Affairs Yousuf bin Alawi bin 
Abdullah, HE Minister of Oil and Gas Dr. Mohammed Bin Hamad, Al Rumhy, OCCI 
President Salim bin Said Al Ghattami, HE <br>
Adviser to Ministry of Commerce and Industry Mohsin bin Khamis Al Balushi and a 
number of senior officials and industry leaders.<br>
<br>
During a media interaction, Mpahlwa said: “We are strengthening our trade ties 
with the Gulf and the Middle East. Oman, of course, is one of the major markets 
for South Africa. We invite Omani industry to set up bases in South Africa, 
which is one of the most attractive destinations for investors, entrepreneurs 
and tourists. Though South Africa and Oman enjoy good political relationships, 
we have not fully translated the relationship with Oman.” He added that there is 
tremendous scope for boosting the trade between the two countries in areas like 
oil and gas, infrastructure development, mining, information technology, tourism 
and telecommunications etc. South Africa is keen to provide Oman with full 
support to expand its mining sector. <br>
Stressing on the close partnership between the private sector of both the 
countries, he said, “The businessmen from South Africa and Oman should join 
hands to build strong industrial houses in the Middle East and Africa region. 
The world is becoming increasingly interdependent, and it is vital for 
developing economies in the region to join hands to explore the positive forces 
of free trade, globalization and safeguard the interests of our countries.” <br>
<br>
The two countries have already signed agreements on double taxation, prevention 
of fiscal evasion to taxes on income, and military co-operation. The new 
initiatives are going to shore up enhanced two-way economic and commercial ties 
between Oman and South Africa, the members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association 
for Regional Cooperation (IORARC).</font></p>

    <img border="0" src="inthenews2.jpg" width="251" height="164" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2"></b>Located 
    at the tip of the African continent, South Africa’s GDP is estimated at more 
    than US$220 billion, and is expected to grow by five per cent in the current 
    financial year. It is a middle-income, emerging market with an abundant 
    supply of natural resources. It is the world’s largest producer of platinum, 
    gold and chromium. It has well-developed financial, legal, communications, 
    energy, and transport sectors. Its stock exchange is ranked among the 10 
    largest stock exchanges in the world. The country has a modern 
    infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban 
    centers throughout the region. However, growth has not been strong enough to 
    lower South Africa’s high unemployment rate and poverty. South African 
    economic policy is fiscally conservative, but pragmatic, focusing on 
    targeting inflation and liberalizing trade as means to increase job growth 
    and household income.</font></td>

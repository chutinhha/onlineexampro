Gulf has been experiencing monumental construction activity over the last few 
years. Both public and private sectors are equally involved in construction. 
Ambitious projects are underway. They range from infrastructure buildings, 
industrial parks, commercial property, and shopping malls to residential 
developments.<br>
<br>
Increasing oil revenues, supported by freehold property laws brought in by 
various Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, are giving fillip to the 
construction industry. Some of the prestigious construction projects of the 
region include Dubai Light Rail — the world’s longest metro system, Saudi 
Arabian Rabigh refinery, The Wave in Oman, the UAE’s Burj Dubai — world’s 
tallest residential tower, the Palm in the UAE — man-made islands, the Sohar 
Aluminium smelter in Oman, RasGas III, Pearl-Qatar in Qatar, Seef — 30-storey 
residential Avare Towers, and Financial Harbor in Bahrain.</font></p>

<img border="1" src="gccdai.jpg" width="250" height="283" align="left"></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">The UAE dominates the Gulf construction sector with US$ 35.562 billion worth of 
projects under construction in 2005, accounting for 63.7 per cent of the total 
value of projects under construction in the GCC states. Saudi Arabia occupies 
the second slot with US$ 7.869 billion, with Qatar US$ 4.596 billion in third 
place followed by Kuwait US$ 9.254 billion, Bahrain US$ 1.99 billion and Oman 
US$ 1.388 billion, according to a study commissioned by the Abu Dhabi National 
Exhibitions Company (ADNEC). <br>
<br>
The study further reveals that as of June 2005, there were a total of 1,825 
building construction projects being implemented within the GCC. The UAE leads 
the market with 820 projects, accounting for 46 per cent of the total. 
Currently, 214 building construction projects are underway in Bahrain, 209 in 
Qatar, 208 in Saudi Arabia, 207 in Kuwait and 167 in Oman. Leisure developments 
totaling US$10 billion are under way/planned in the Gulf States in the next 
decade in response to the high level of internal and external tourism in the 
region.<br>
<br>
With UAE dominating the GCC construction market, about 60 per cent of the total 
construction spend in GCC will also take place in this country alone. 
Dubai-based large property developers Nakheel, Emaar, Dubai Properties and Dubai 
international properties have announced projects worth billions, taking UAE’s 
share of investment to US$ 221 billion, according to the MEED report. Emaar 
alone is working on nine industrial projects worth US$ 1 billion. Government 
sources expect that US$ 50 billion will be invested in the real estate sector 
during 2004-2010 in Dubai.<br>
<br>
Bahrain also experienced ups and downs in the construction and real estate 
industry. After a decline in performance during 1999 to 2001, the industry 
picked up steadily and in the first half of 2004, 171 and 341 licenses were 
issued for the construction sector and real estate, rentals and associated 
activities sector respectively. In 2003, the industry recorded a staggering 114 
per cent growth over 2002. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, annual investments in 
construction industry have touched an average of US$ 19.99 billion between 1999 
and 2003. </font></p>

<img border="0" src="gccdai1.jpg" width="200" height="130" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2"><font face="Verdana" size="1">In the last few years, construction sector is contributing heavily to the GDP of 
the GCC countries. On an average, real estate and construction sectors make up 
almost 10 per cent of the total GDP in the region. In Qatar, the construction 
sector’s contribution to GDP has witnessed a 73 per cent jump between 2002 and 
2005. In the UAE, the growth has been 40 per cent for the same period. For 
Bahrain, construction sector has contributed US$ 368.35 million (3.85 per cent 
of GDP) in 2003, as compared to US$ 355.97 million in 2002 (4.2 per cent of 
GDP). Real estate and business services contributed US$ 850.385 million in 2003 
(8.9 per cent of GDP), as compared to US$ 821.5 million in 2002 (9.8 per cent of 
GDP).<br>
<br>
The increase in demand for low and middle-end housing in the last few years has 
led to drastic increase in property prices in the region. Land prices as a 
proportion of the total project cost on an average increased to as high as 25 
per cent in Kuwait and Qatar. High land prices may push up cost of many of 
ongoing projects.</font></p>

    <p style="margin: 10px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Dubai issues property law</b><br>
    The Dubai Government, in a historic move, issued a long-awaited property law 
    that legalises foreign ownership of properties in pre-designated areas in 
    the emirate. His Highness Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, 
    Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, issued Law 
    No. 7 that legalises freehold ownership of land and property for UAE and GCC 
    citizens, while allowing the same rights to non-GCC expatriates to 
    pre-designated areas that will be approved by the Ruler of Dubai.<br>
    <br>
    Non-GCC expatriates will be given the right to acquire freehold and 99-year 
    lease property in designated areas. The law comes nearly four years after 
    the government first announced freehold ownership to expatriates, grouped 
    under three Dubai-government owned entities Emaar Properties, Nakheel and 
    Dubai Properties. <br>
    <br>
    The new law paves the way for expatriate homeowners to register their 
    properties in their names with Dubai Lands and Properties Department, which 
    has been gearing up for the rush in registration. The law will be followed 
    by a number of new bylaws that will identify the freehold areas in Dubai and 
    determine the registration fees and procedures. More than 13,000 expatriate 
    families have already moved in to their new homes, without securing title 
    deeds in their names, while another 7,000 are expected to move in by the end 
    of the year. They all will benefit by the new law.</font></td>

</b>Increasing gold rates have had no negative effect on the sales and demand 
for gold. The Gulf region’s enthusiasm for gold has not reduced. In 2005, the 
demand was strong in the Middle East with 9 per cent growth for the region and a 
new record for jewelry off-take in the United Arab Emirates (96 tonnes).<br>
<br>
Increasing construction activities and passionate tourists have helped in 
boosting gold trade. While gold demand increased by 13 per cent in Saudi Arabia, 
it rose by just 5 per cent worldwide in 2005. Saudi Arabia showed the strongest 
overall growth for the region with jewelry demand rising by 12 per cent and 
overall demand by 13 per cent. Despite a fall in fourth quarter, the UAE also 
recorded 8 per cent increase in jewelry demand Jewelry buying in the rest of the 
Gulf region, including Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, was 5 per cent higher in 
2005 compared to 2004 with the price rise in Q4 having only a limited impact on 
buying. The increase in gold demand prevailed in the Kingdom’s neighboring Gulf 
countries, including Turkey and Egypt.<br>
<br>
Price volatility, rather than increase in price, in the last quarter of 2005 was 
the prime deterrent to purchase. The impact of the price rise in Q4 2005 was 
also more muted in Saudi Arabia than in the rest of the region with jewelry 
demand dropping by just 3 per cent on Q4 2004.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gccdai3.jpg" width="203" height="37"><br>
Without the support of oil, gas and mineral expansion sectors, Saudi Arabia 
managed to attract US$ 26.046 billion cumulative foreign direct investments in 
2005. According to the preliminary results shown in a report recently released 
by Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA), the total foreign and 
joint investments executed are estimated at US$ 8.104 billion, with a growth 
rate of 95 per cent compared to 2004 when the actually executed investments 
reached US$ 4.158 billion.<br>
<br>
Amr Abdullah Al-Dabbagh, Governor, SAGIA said the Kingdom registered a 30 fold 
increase in foreign investments, especially, overseas investments. In 2005, it 
totaled US$ 53.32 billion. Even the International Finance Corporation in its 
“Doing Business in 2006” report placed Saudi Arabia ahead of Kuwait and Oman and 
38th out of 155 locations worldwide for investment.<br>
<br>
Japan leads the table of top investors in the Kingdom followed by the UAE, 
Bahrain and the US. Japan invested around US$ 2.319 billion in the Kingdom 
during 2005. However, the US is in the forefront when cumulative investments are 
compared until the end of 2005. Investments of the US are worth US$ 9.421 
billion for 265 projects, followed by Japan with US$ 4.561 billion in 35 
projects, and the UAE with US$ 3.113 billion in 84 projects.<br>
<br>
To encourage foreign investment further, the Kingdom is studying a tax credit 
formula, said Al-Dabbagh. The other initiatives under consideration include 
setting up of a re-export zone to encourage entrepreneurs. Raw materials brought 
in for manufacturing would be exempted from customs duty, which would be imposed 
on the finished products only.<br>

This year’s no-deficit budget was the first integrated one in 25 years that is 
based on the three-year performance-budgeting system (PBS), and is the second 
balanced budget in 25 years introduced in the United Arab Emirates. The UAE is 
the first country in the region to implement the PBS in its financial and 
accounting system as per international standards.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gccdai2.jpg" width="208" height="156" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2">The 
UAE Cabinet has announced its second balanced federal budget which has a revenue 
outlay of US$7.569 billion, 23 per cent higher than the previous year. The 2006 
budget focuses on education, health, social services and projects. The budget 
has balanced expenditure and revenue, both totaling US$ 7.59 billion. <br>
<br>
The 2006 budget was approved by the Cabinet. “For the second executive year, the 
budget achieved a zero-deficit,” Dr Mohammad Khalfan Bin Kharbash, Minister of 
State for Financial and Industrial Affairs, said. The budget gives to priority 
in spending to public and higher education, with the allocation of 36.6 per cent 
for this key sector, or about US$ 1.966 billion, compared with US$ 1.82 billion 
in 2005.<br>
<br>
The government has allocated 16.8 per cent (US$ 880 million) for the security 
sector, 8.5 per cent or US$ 443.84 million for the health sector, an increase of 
42 per cent over last year, while social affairs received 7.8 per cent (US$ 
408.45 million). Infrastructure allocation stood at US$ 364.88 million (7 per 
cent) while project sector allocations totalled US$ 326.76 million (6.3 per 
cent) compared with US$ 239.62 million last year. The increase in education and 
health allocations came in line with the directives of President His Highness 
Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and Shaikh Mohammad. <br>
<br>
Bin Kharbash stressed that the 2006 budget does not envisage any increases in 
fees for services offered by the federal government. The increase in allocations 
for education is aimed at developing the sector by introducing modern technology 
applications and to help students develop their educational and scientific 
skills. The additional US$ 68 million added to the health sector allocations was 
aimed at meeting the increasing requirements of hospitals and medical 
institutions for equipment, medicines and staff. <br>

Recent estimations by the Public Authority for Civil Information (PACI) reveal 
that the total population of Kuwait stands at 2.75 million at the end of 2004. 
Population growth accelerated to an annual rate of 8 per cent as the number of 
expatriates rose sharply in 2004. Nearly 1.79 million or 66 per cent are 
expatriates, while 956 thousand are Kuwaiti nationals. The number of non-Kuwaiti 
residents increased by 11 per cent from a year ago compared to 6.4 per cent in 
2003. Growth of the Kuwaiti segment slowed down slightly to 3.1 per cent.<br>
<br>
Non-Kuwaitis dominated the work force, representing 82.2 per cent of the total, 
at the end of 2004. Expatriate labour force increased by 12 per cent annually. 
However, the number of working Kuwaitis also increased 6.6 per cent from the 
previous year, the fastest rate of growth in seven years.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="bahrain.jpg" width="201" height="36"><br>
The Industry and Commerce Ministry has envisaged a detailed blueprint for the 
industrial sector that is expected to triple the industry’s contribution to 
Bahrain’s economy — from 12 per cent to 36 per cent in 10 years — and create 
30,000 new jobs, with competitive salaries, in the same period.<br>
<br>
The plan aims at making Bahrain a world-class industrial hub. The plan will 
focus on export of non-traditional items as well as global competition, with a 
view to becoming a hub of highly profitable, knowledge-based and 
environment-friendly industries. The Minister of Industry and Commerce, Dr 
Hassan Fakhro, informed the Shura Council: “Our goal is to ensure that GDP grows 
to 8.6 per cent per year from the present 7.1.”<br>
<br>
The Kingdom will diversify into various industrial and manufacturing activities 
such as the manufacturing of aircraft parts and auxiliary equipment, production 
of soaps, detergents and paints and analysing their export potential within the 
Gulf. The policy also covers electric train and car spare parts, transportation 
equipment, computers and electronics items. A high-tech fashion industry will be 
developed to compete at the regional and international&nbsp; levels. But the 
textiles sector must “refocus on the product mix” to gain and retain foothold in 
the international market, according to the minister. <br>
<br>
To achieve the target, the ministry was working to make changes in legislations 
to ensure more businessmen were encouraged to invest in industries. “The 
strategy brings businessmen and the government together to help raise the 
industrial sector,” the minister added. For smooth policy implementation, a 
business support centre will provide information and advice on all aspects of 
planning and technology transfer. And a productivity and competitiveness centre 
will work on increasing output of new and existing units. “What we need is a 
business-friendly legal system to support innovation, entrepreneurship and 
business operations. With major reforms in the education and health sectors, we 
can have a world-class environment for a competitive and knowledge-based 
industrial sector,” he said.<br>

The Middle East’s first energy business hub, Energy City Qatar (ECQ), was 
officially launched recently. It will be the region’s first full-service energy 
business centre catering to the commercial, technical and human resource needs 
of the oil and gas industry operating in the region, with cutting edge 
facilities and services. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gccdai4.jpg" width="69" height="119" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2">The 
Middle East accounts for over 60 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves and 
over 40 percent of the world’s natural gas reserves. But, the region doesn’t 
have a dedicated energy business centre. ECQ was conceived with the central aim 
of filling this void and positively contributing to the economic development of 
Qatar and the region.<br>
<br>
Envisioned by Gulf Energy, ECQ aims to attract the industry leaders in Oil and 
Gas production, International Oil Companies, National Oil Companies, support 
services, infrastructure and downstream activities, shipping and trading, market 
and resource data, intellectual property and energy trading. It will also be 
home to a dedicated energy trading platform, the International Mercantile 
Exchange (Imex), which will be regulated by the Qatar Financial Centre 
Regulatory Authority. It will be an innovative, intelligent, vibrant energy 
centre filled with customers, suppliers and related service providers freely 
interacting, cooperating and competing for the advancement of energy sector.<br>
<br>
ECQ forms part of the major new city development, Lusail, which in addition to 
major business and entertainment districts, will be home to up to 200,000 
residents. ECQ’s lead financial advisor is Gulf Finance House, and PFC Energy, 
the leading global energy consultant, is the strategic advisor. Its strategic 
partners are Abu Dhabi Investment House and Kuwait Investment Company.<br>

            us about your career with Siemens </b><br>
            I have been working for Siemens for more than 11 years. <br>
            After schooling, I studied telecommunications for four years in Ulm, 
            Germany. I graduated in March 1992. Immediately following this, I 
            joined Siemens as a Technical Solution Expert. In January 1993, I 
            was posted to Syria as a Technical Assistance Engineer. <br>
            Two years later, I moved to Sudan where I first took on the role as 
            an Implementation Manager and later, in May 1996, I was promoted to 
            the position as Sudan's General Manager for Telecommunications. 
            There, I was involved with the digitalisation of the country's 
            telecom network and succeeded in linking the capital Khartoum to 
            Port Sudan with fibre-optic cabling and SDH transmission across 
            1,200 km over wadis, desert and mountainous areas. Despite the long 
            distance, tough terrain and even a volatile monsoon climate in 
            Sudan, we triumphed over these logistical hurdles and completed the 
            project on time and within budget.<br>
            In 1999, I returned to our head office in Munich as a Sales Director 
            for two years dealing with countries in the Middle East including 
            Oman. I was hungry for another assignment overseas and when the 
            opportunity of heading the Siemens AG Muscat branch appeared, I 
            grabbed it.<br>
            <br>
            <b>If you changed career, what would you choose to do?</b><br>
            When I was a child I dreamt of becoming a pilot. This was the main 
            reason why I neglected studying French to learn English which is an 
            essential prerequisite for joining the aviation industry. 
            Fortunately I landed a good job in telecommunications instead. 
            However, if I changed career I would like to create dedicated 
            equipment solutions for the disabled. This would, for example, 
            involve developing new devices to supervise patients with particular 
            disorders, perhaps aid sight to those who are visually impaired, or 
            maybe boost sound for those hard of hearing. I think this would be a 
            fascinating area to work in.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>If you were arranging a tour of 
            Germany, where would you take your visitors?<br>
            </b>I would make certain that they visit Berlin because it is the 
            centre of much of Germany's history, particularly in recent times. I 
            would also show them Munich, a city where old traditions have 
            survived and continue to flourish. Of course I would not ignore the 
            museums. My favourites are the Deutches Museum, the biggest 
            technology museum in the world, and the Mensch und Technik (which 
            literally means 'Humans and Technology'), a museum which showcases 
            the latest technological innovations offering some very interesting 
            interactive and illustrative exhibits which are great fun for 
            children and grown ups. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Germans are renowned for being innovative. Name 3 recent 
            innovations from your homeland that have excited you. </b><br>
            Three recent German innovations that spring to my mind are:<br>
            (1) The Maybach produced by Mercedes Benz which gives a Rolls a run 
            for its money;<br>
            (2) The Transrapid which is train that has been recently developed 
            that moves rapidly along a track using electromagnetic fields as a 
            source of energy; and<br>
            (3) Siemens Converged Networks (of course) which converges the 
            voice, data and video elements of fixed and mobile communications.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How many languages can you speak fluently?</b><br>
            Ich spreche fliessend Deutsch und Englisch (which is German for 'I 
            speak German and English fluently'). I can cope with French and also 
            have a basic understanding of Spanish. Despite Siemens being a 
            German company, every time I send an e-mail to a colleague in my 
            head office in Munich I will type it in English.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>How IT savvy are you?</b><br>
            If you look around my office desk, you will notice that, aside from 
            my fixed line telephone and PC, I have a notebook computer, a PDA 
            (personal digital assistant) and a Siemens mobile phone using 
            bluetooth technology. This offers me lots of freedom. I like being 
            able to store information across different digital platforms that I 
            can easily access or share at any given time. I also enjoy making 
            notes in an electronic format which I can refer to and update 
            anywhere later on. <br>
            <br>
            <b>How much time do you spend on the phone each day?</b><br>
            On a typical working day, I spend a lot of my time on the telephone. 
            I could not quantify it exactly for you. I prefer doing business 
            face-to-face or voice-to-voice in a direct conversation rather than 
            by e-mail. I receive between 60 to 80 e-mails each day and need to 
            apply filters to control this flow. I'm convinced that e-mail 
            communication is not being used as efficiently as it could be. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which functions on a handset do you think are the most important?</b><br>
            Personally, the most important button on a handset is usually the 
            one to switch it off so you can spend some time relaxing. But 
            realistically, I tend to switch my phone to 'silent' during the 
            evenings and weekends because being contactable is very important to 
            me. Beyond this, the most important buttons for me are concerned 
            with the synchronisation of data with other electronic devices. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What eagerly awaited telephony solutions should we be eagerly 
            awaiting?</b><br>
            Voice over Internet Protocol (IP) and Video Conferencing over IP are 
            considered to be two of the most important telephony solutions that 
            will be released in Oman soon. We may not need to wait too long for 
            them.<br>
            <b><br>
            Tell us about your hobbies</b><br>
            Today my main hobby is 'my family'. Most of the time I spend away 
            from the office is devoted to them. Earlier it was always football. 
            I played for 15 years in a Sunday League. My main position was in 
            defence. I also chose to shoot penalties. I used to be able to run 
            100m in 11.4 seconds, so although I was not technically skilful at 
            soccer, my speed compensated for this. <br>
            Another of my passions is music, from classical symphonies to rock 
            ballads. I was once a conductor in a brass band but since moving 
            abroad I rarely have the time to practice this hobby. I do manage to 
            fool around on my trombone on occasions but my 4-year-old daughter 
            is usually insistent that I should stop playing it. She has a 
            refined taste. </font></p>

            50 per cent jump in the number of big-format retail outlets in the 
            past few years, over five new hypermarkets slated to open in the 
            next two years Ð at least three in the next 12 months, more than a 
            dozen supermarkets waiting to throw open their doors to customers, 
            acceleration of growth in convenience stores in the country: There's 
            nothing short of a revolution happening in Oman's retail sector.<br>
            According to retail tracking services firm MEMRB, the number of 
            large and small groceries in the Sultanate far exceeds local 
            requirements. Superstores and supermarkets have the largest 
            marketshare in Oman's food retail. Many of them import directly, and 
            have efficient logistics and upgraded storage means. With big-format 
            retail outlets accounting for more than 40 per cent (and growing) 
            marketshare in Oman's food distribution, the country's retail sector 
            is in the throes of a metamorphosis. <br>
            &quot;The entry of Carrefour in Muscat in 2001 has been one of the major 
            factors driving the growth of the supermarket business in Oman. 
            Along with the Sultan Center, Spinneys' recent buyout of Al Fair, 
            and Lu Lu's first hypermarket in Muscat scheduled to open in 
            mid-2004 (with an existing store in Salalah), competition will 
            intensify among supermarket retailers with the result predictably 
            that small grocery outlets will close and other independent 
            supermarkets will be forced to modernise to survive,&quot; says Anna 
            Latzias, Group Account Manager (Gulf Region), MEMRB Retail Tracking 
            Services.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The retail roulette</b><br>
            As retail pros will have you believe, this is just the beginning of 
            the shakeout. &quot;The small and medium stores will, obviously, be 
            affected,&quot; believes Adil Ghouse, general manager (consumer products 
            division), Khimji Ramdas. &quot;We will soon be witnessing major changes 
            in the retail market in Muscat, and a shakeout is bound to happen 
            within the next 3-5 years,&quot; he adds. This is typical of the shape 
            that Oman's retail market is taking.<br>
            In fact, the imminent shakeout may have already begun. Al Fair, for 
            one, has undergone many changes in the recent past. In July 2003, 
            Matrah Cold Stores LLC (MCS), part of the WJ Towell Group, and the 
            Al Seer Group, Dubai, formed a joint venture company Al Fair LLC, 
            dedicated to the development of the Al Fair grocery retail business 
            in Oman. The new company acquired nine Al Fair shops throughout the 
            Sultanate from MCS, and under the management of Spinneys Dubai 
            (co-owned by MCS and Al Seer), it has spelt out that it has major 
            plans to invest significantly in extending the brand's position as 
            the leading neighbourhood grocery retailer in Oman. <br>
            Al Fair's renewal of ties with Spinneys (before 1999, both were part 
            of the same group) reflects the fact that in a market where 
            economies of scale are a critical determinant of profitability, 
            every advantage counts. Experts agree that the joint venture will 
            pool resources and reduce costs as about 70 per cent of Al Fair's 
            merchandise is sourced from the UAE. <br>
            While retailers big and small are opening up more and more outlets 
            in Muscat while other regions in the country get a trickle here or 
            there, the cake, obviously, isn't getting any bigger. &quot;Before the 
            new schemes come on line, there are already rumours of some existing 
            operators not performing to expectations and with no real increase 
            in the customer base and/or spending power, the situation is likely 
            to become more and more competitive,&quot; says Michael Lowes, general 
            manager, Cluttons, a real estate agent.<br>
            It isn't too difficult to see that there are bound to be casualties 
            in the 'supermarket wars' that will inevitably arise due to 
            increased competition that is scheduled to unfold in the next 8-12 
            months. &quot;Every hypermarket is taking a risk to expand. Some 
            retailers are not taking a calculated risk,&quot; opines Abdulla Khalid 
            ElJazra, COO, Sultan Centre LLC. &quot;Those not willing to invest in 
            more stores and improvements in their overall retail offer will be 
            among the losers,&quot; he cautions. Players with deep pockets and the 
            ability to endure losses over a sustained period of time will most 
            probably survive any fallout from fierce discount retailing during 
            the time when more hypermarkets open.<br>
            And there are plenty in the pipeline. Even as the India-based Emke 
            group's Lu Lu Centre contemplates announcing the opening up of its 
            first hypermarket in Al Ghoubra in the second half of 2004 and in 
            Darsait later than that, Safeer Centre International LLC (part of 
            the Safeer Group in the UAE which operates 54 department/supermarket 
            stores in Dubai and runs the Pic 'n' Save and Select 'n' Save stores 
            in Oman), is ready with a new Safeer hypermarket in Azaiba, Muscat, 
            which is opening on October 10, 2003. <br>
            By mid-2004, Sultan Center has plans afoot to open a larger 'cash 
            and carry' outlet in Seeb, close to rivals Carrefour and Al-Burj on 
            a plot of land covering a 120,000 sq mt. Sultan Centre's ElJazra 
            reveals that this opening is part of a broader plan that 
            incorporates the introduction of (around 15) shops &quot;a little larger 
            than convenience wholesale stores&quot; around the country in locations 
            such as Sur and Barka. <br>
            Carrefour itself is rumoured to have identified a location for its 
            second superstore in the country. Besides this, Khimji's is actively 
            looking at high catchment areas in the capital to identify the 
            location for more outlets as part of the second phase of its growth 
            plans.<br>
            Despite the fact that Oman's population is growing rapidly and is 
            expected to double to over 3 million by 2010, a report published by 
            the International Labour Organisation this year shows that the 
            Sultanate's population growth is outstripping its GDP growth. This 
            suggests that there is no explosive growth in consumer-spend. Why, 
            then, this mad rush? <br>
            <br>
            <b>Taking the lid off retailing</b><br>
            Retailing has been one of the country's most active sectors in the 
            past five years, with the industry being the latest bandwagon that 
            has witnessed hordes of players leaping onto it. The word retailing 
            is derived from the French word 'retailer', which means 'to cut up' 
            or 'to break the bulk'. In the words of marketing guru Philip Kotler, 
            &quot;Retailing includes all the activities involved in selling goods or 
            services directly to final consumers for personal, non-business 
            use&quot;.<br>
            To be fair, retailing, one of the largest sectors in the global 
            economy, is going through a transition phase not only in Oman but 
            the world over. The world's largest company, Wal-Mart, is a 
            retailer. It even surpassed the revenue of Exxon Mobil in 2001 with 
            roughly $28 billion (RO10.77 billion) more in income. It has grown 
            its sales at a compound rate of 15 per cent per year over the last 
            six years. That, however, is not the only reason why the number of 
            large retail outlets in Oman is witnessing an upswing. It's the fact 
            that the customer is getting increasingly exposed to global trends, 
            and customer service no longer means paying mere lip-service. <br>
            In the last two decades, the relative dependence on agri-food 
            imports has yielded the development of the infrastructure and import 
            facilities in the region. GCC countries are multi-ethnic markets, 
            resulting in a wide variety of food products offered on local 
            market. The expatriate community throughout the GCC has influenced 
            the food consumption in the region and, therefore, food product 
            imports. Moreover, as a result of Gulf nationals travelling to 
            Europe and North America, consumers in the region have become more 
            aware of quality, nutritious value, price and packaging, willing to 
            pay extra for premium quality products.<br>
            Although hypermarkets still account for only a small portion of 
            total retail sales in Oman, they have caught on with consumers and 
            attracted attention Ñ and investment Ñ from the biggest players in 
            the game. The rapid rise of hypermarkets in Oman represents a huge 
            opportunity for both domestic and multinational retailers. &quot;There is 
            a global shift in retail trends towards consumers shopping at larger 
            stores and hypermarkets because they generally offer greater choice 
            and better prices,&quot; maintains Ashish Vasudev, who is a sales manager 
            with Fairtrade's Kraft Foods Division. <br>
            For a long time, the corner grocery store was the only choice 
            available to the consumer in Oman. This has given way to 
            international formats of retailing, especially in the urban areas. 
            The traditional food and grocery segment has seen the emergence of 
            hypermarkets (Carrefour, Al-Burj, Sultan Centre), 
            supermarkets/superstores (Khimji's Mart, LuLu, Al Fair, Al Jadeeda, 
            Pic 'n' Save, Select 'n' Save etc.), and gas station-based 
            convenience stores (Shell Select, BP Express and Al Maha Souk). <br>
            <br>
            <b>Retail: The Oman story</b><br>
            In the last two decades, consumer demographics and attitudes have 
            changed considerably - the population has become younger, more 
            urbanised, more demanding in terms of the shopping environment, more 
            willing to try out new products, and more exposed to suppliers' 
            marketing efforts - all of which has helped the development of the 
            supermarket concept. <br>
            Oman's food retail segment is quite similar to the ones in other GCC 
            countries. Supermarkets and self-service stores are available 
            offering a wide range of food products and complementary services. 
            The food retail in the country is becoming more diversified and is 
            divided into the following categories: supermarkets; convenience 
            stores/ gas marts; institutional retailers (non-profit retailers 
            serving the military and police force); cash and carry, wholesalers; 
            and A&amp;B groceries, which are smaller in size than supermarkets. <br>
            According to MEMRB, the estimated number of grocery outlets in Oman 
            in early 2002 was 7,194. Compared to 1998, this actually represents 
            a decrease of 6 per cent with large groceries suffering the biggest 
            decrease in number of outlets (15 per cent) and small groceries by 5 
            per cent. Self-service increased by 5 per cent, but predictably, the 
            number of supermarkets increased substantially from 30 in 1998 to 45 
            in 2002. The results of the Omanisation of the retail trade may 
            quicken this process.<br>
            Khimji's Ghouse estimates that Oman will witness a sea change as far 
            as the volume of sales conducted through the 'big-format' stores is 
            concerned. &quot;There will be a 35-50 per cent jump in sales through 
            'upper trade' channels within a year of the opening up of the 
            proposed hypermarkets in Oman,&quot; he declares. &quot;This may go up to 60 
            per cent in subsequent years,&quot; he reckons.<br>
            Most evident in the capital region, the increasing competition from 
            larger hyper/supermarkets chains has forced the closure of not only 
            large and small groceries, but also smaller B Class independent 
            supermarkets. &quot;With supermarkets increasing in sales importance, we 
            expect this trend to continue but unlike the rest of the GCC, this 
            change will be more incremental rather than rapid,&quot; says MEMRB's 
            Latzias. <br>
            That said, the convenience of small grocery outlets will ensure they 
            will stick around for some time to come. Comparative to the rest of 
            the Gulf, Oman's retail trade still remains heavily characterised by 
            small traditional grocery stores. &quot;Some traditional Omani customers 
            feel a little uncomfortable with large hypermarkets and prefer to 
            shop in the smaller stores. This may be because they receive more 
            personal attention and are known by name and because they feel more 
            comfortable with the shop's layout and location,&quot; says Fairtrade's 
            Vasudev.<br>
            However, the worrying factor seems to be the fact that the largest 
            grocery retail players, including the proposed ones, are 
            concentrated in the capital region. With just a little over 12 per 
            cent of the Sultanate's population (including expatriates) living in 
            urban areas, the competition is getting fiercer and more fearsome. 
            Compare that figure with city states like Kuwait's 96 per cent and 
            Bahrain's 83 per cent, or even UAE's 82 per cent and Saudi Arabia's 
            78 per cent, and the picture looks even more depressing. With all 
            the bigger retailers targetting this small percentage of the 
            populace, the Omani retail market is getting increasingly 
            overcrowded. So where lies the differentiator?<br>
            <br>
            <b>It's the service, of course</b><br>
            Most retailers, of course, testify that the differentiator between 
            them is the service they offer to customers. A lot of factors come 
            together to make a shopping experience enjoyable. These include a 
            clean environment, a wide range of shops that complement each other, 
            adequate restaurant facilities and car parking.<br>
            Rather predictably, Naveen Vazirani, accountant, Safeer Centre 
            International LLC, says that customer service will differentiate the 
            new Safeer store with its nearby competition, which includes a 
            successful Al Jadeeda Stores outlet and a busy Rawasco store.<br>
            The retail sector in Oman has undoubtedly witnessed a radical 
            transformation. Be it for branded apparels, packaged foods or 
            electronics, the Omani consumer has begun to ask for more and is 
            correspondingly being bombarded with an increased variety of 
            options. The success of large malls like Carrefour and Sultan Center 
            has encouraged a number of developers to join the retail bandwagon.<br>
            &quot;In Oman, shopping is becoming more of a family outing in the 
            evening,&quot; comments Khimji's Ghouse. &quot;Along with the price 
            sensitivities and quality consciousness, it's also about 
            entertainment,&quot; he adds. Little wonder, then, that the shift in 
            consumer spending patterns suggests that they are doing their 
            monthly shopping from bigger stores while sales from smaller stores 
            are restricted to urgency and convenience-based factors. &quot;It's the 
            replenishment items and perishable goods that are driving sales of 
            smaller shops,&quot; says Ghouse.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Margins, what margins?</b><br>
            As any retailer worth his salt will vouch, retail margins are the 
            first to be sacrificed at the altar of competition. Food, drink and 
            tobacco, the largest selling items as far as FMCGs (Fast Moving 
            Consumable Goods) are concerned within hypermarkets, also possess 
            the least profit margins. And it's a must to ensure repeat 
            footfalls. &quot;Gross drivers like grocery are sold at cost, even at a 
            loss at times,&quot; swears Khimji's Ghouse. <br>
            Organised retail as a sector in Oman is at a dynamic stage. The 
            challenges that the players face are high rentals, conservative 
            spending habits and value-driven price-conscious consumers, which 
            cuts into the retailer's margins. The one way that retailers are 
            trying to meet these challenges is by expanding to meet the 
            desirable economies of scale and establish bargaining power with the 
            branded goods manufacturers. This expansion drive of the organised 
            retailers is creating demand for retail real estate and keeping 
            retail development ventures buoyant. <br>
            The rents that these operators pay depend upon the arrangement with 
            the particular landlord or property owner. The land may be leased to 
            the operator, who then constructs the building or, alternatively, 
            the land owner may construct the building to the operators' 
            specifications. The rental would be agreed between the parties and 
            would be on the basis of a long-term lease likely to be a minimum of 
            10 years. For the landlord, this represents an attractive investment 
            which would be considered far more secure than other property 
            investments in Muscat due to the length of the lease (most other 
            leases on commercial and residential property being renewable 
            annually).<br>
            &quot;In terms of the rental level that is agreed in these deals, the 
            landlord will obviously have reference to the land value, the cost 
            of construction and the return that he requires. These factors will 
            also be relevant to the operator, but of more importance will be his 
            ability to pay this rental based upon his anticipated level of 
            trade,&quot; explains Lowes of Cluttons, which is at present looking for 
            tenants at Muscat City Center at the first floor level.<br>
            Then there is also the display-based revenue model, wherein a 
            hypermarket or large superstore charges its suppliers for the 
            branding opportunities that it provides. It could be a kiosk, 
            branding on the floor or on the trolley and even the signage fees 
            which helps the outlet boost its bottom line. Also don't forget the 
            sub-letting of fast food chains and other such money-spinners that 
            not only add up to the kitty in terms of hard cash, but also act as 
            a magnet for attracting footfalls, which in turns strengthens the 
            outlet's bargaining power vis-ˆ-vis its suppliers Ð the more the 
            footfalls, the better the branding opportunity for suppliers. <br>
            Then there are also hypermarkets like Al Burj that do not rent out 
            display space. &quot;We treat our suppliers as partners and do not charge 
            rent for displaying their products,&quot; confirms Jean Claude, director, 
            Al Burj Trading and Consumers' LLC, which has a supermarket in 
            Bidiya and a wholesale shop in Saham apart from the hypermarket in 
            Al Khoud, at the outskirts of the capital. Purely banking on the 
            fact that it is &quot;the only 100 per cent Omani hypermarket in the 
            country,&quot; Al Burj has witnessed a 35-40 per cent growth over the 
            previous year, maintains Claude. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Anchoring power</b><br>
            The advent of malls has brought with it the concept of an anchor, 
            which occupies a sizeable percentage of the total usable area in a 
            mall. The anchor is expected to attract a variety of consumers and, 
            hence, is the key to increasing footfalls in a mall. &quot;Having a 
            successful anchor store, which creates high levels of traffic is 
            beneficial and, in fact, the key to the operation of a successful 
            shopping centre,&quot; says Cluttons' Lowes. <br>
            &quot;The success of footfall created by Carrefour is the major reason 
            for tenant occupation of the other units in Muscat City Center,&quot; 
            says Christopher Steel, general manager of Hamptons in Oman. The 
            success of a mall could be largely dependent on the ability of the 
            anchor to attract consumers. &quot;Without Carrefour as an anchor, it is 
            debatable that other tenants would have committed to the location,&quot; 
            he explains.<br>
            Due to the strategic role that an anchor plays in the success of a 
            mall and the fact that it occupies a sizeable area within the mall, 
            the capital/rental values paid by an anchor are at a significant 
            discount to that paid by other occupants. &quot;It is well known that 
            tenants at Muscat City Center have been requesting rent reductions,&quot; 
            claims Steel. Rents there are currently around RO16 per square metre 
            (compared to neighbour Markaz Al Bahja's RO10 per sq mt). It is 
            clearly not a financially logical position for most small retailers, 
            but they obviously take the view that their presence should be there 
            to support overall regional exposure.<br>
            Other hypermarkets in the country are slightly different in that 
            they tend to be standalone units and rely upon their brand or sheer 
            size to attract customers. &quot;There are a number of examples of other 
            shopping centres in Muscat which do not have an obvious anchor store 
            and, therefore, would be significantly less attractive to smaller 
            retailers and therefore not able to command premium rents,&quot; 
            maintains Lowes. &quot;There is no doubt a large number of the tenants 
            would think seriously about relocation if rents were cheaper in a 
            location elsewhere that attained the same footfall as at Muscat City 
            Center,&quot; says Steel.<br>
            <br>

              <b>

              <img border="0" src="im27.jpg" align="right" width="239" height="198">Supply 
            side economics</b><br>
            As the market naturally grows, there will be significant benefits 
            for suppliers, local food distribution companies agree. With a wider 
            range of shelf space, suppliers can develop new and tertiary product 
            lines in hypermarkets and the cost of distribution should reduce as 
            suppliers and hypermarkets develop an efficient goods delivery 
            system together. Moreover, there is usually better security that the 
            goods will be paid for on time allowing for better payment 
            facilities to be given to hypermarkets, and larger stores offer 
            better opportunities for suppliers to merchandise produce Ð larger 
            shelf-space means that more products can receive better visibility.<br>
            &quot;It is certainly true that as the larger stores grow and command a 
            higher percentage of a supplier's business, they will increasingly 
            seek additional benefits such as over-rider arrangements and higher 
            rates for promotions and displays. The costs of doing business alter 
            with promotional spend rising and logistics cost reducing,&quot; concedes 
            Dominic Myers, general manager, MCS. <br>
            He feels that the proposition of hypermarkets sourcing products (the 
            same sold by local suppliers) from abroad is not attractive because 
            Oman's suppliers give them a good level of service locally, they 
            gain attractive credit terms from these suppliers and there would 
            need to be a significant price differential for the hypermarket to 
            opt to pay the additional duty and logistical charges.<br>
            Myers believes that the emergence of many hypermarkets is good news 
            for Oman. &quot;It's certainly good for customers because, generally, 
            hypermarkets will reduce grocery retail prices in the country.&quot; 
            Indeed, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figures in Oman show 
            that the level of prices dropped by 0.7 per cent in 2002, and they 
            declined by 1 per cent in 2001.<br>
            &quot;The bottom line for a distributor such as MCS is that we will need 
            to adapt quickly with the changing retail environment, become more 
            sophisticated and IT-driven, and equip our sales teams with the 
            necessary skills to compete in the market. Having been both a retail 
            distributor and retailer, we have an appreciation of what a 
            hypermarket requires and can, therefore, tailor our business to 
            their requirements,&quot; explains Myers.<br>
            &quot;It is extremely difficult for suppliers like us as the margins are 
            constantly getting squeezed. The bigger the retailer, the harder the 
            negotiations,&quot; echoes Khimji's Ghouse, which distributes brands like 
            Procter &amp; Gamble and Phillip Morris besides commodities like sugar, 
            wheat and coffee beans etc. &quot;However,&quot; he adds, &quot;it is still easier 
            in the Middle East than it is in Europe or other Western markets 
            where big retailers are literally squeezing the suppliers out of 
            business.&quot;<br>
            There is also the practice of retailers getting into manufacturing 
            themselves and further alienating the suppliers. Says Fairtrade's 
            Vasudev: &quot;There is a threat that larger retailers in the future will 
            produce their own branded products which may have an adverse effect 
            on retail suppliers.&quot; <br>
            Some experts say that listing fees, space rental and all sorts of 
            other deals determine what's on the shelves, not essentially 
            off-take. &quot;Key accounts are of growing importance and the 
            one-offer-fits-all approach will be increasingly less acceptable. 
            This, of course, in itself leads to problems for companies trying to 
            control pricing in the market and, for instance, stopping the 
            situation where a major wholesaler complains that a retailer is 
            selling tea for less than he can because of some special deal it has 
            negotiated. So, managing relations with customers is also of growing 
            importance,&quot; says Kieran O' Brien, a director with IMES Consulting.
            <br>
            Suppliers' margins will be hit. More interestingly, there is 
            undoubtedly going to be rationalisation. &quot;Retailers are already 
            beginning to de-list slow-moving items as they understand their 
            costs better and some are trying to move away from listing fees as a 
            core income source. This will lead to greater polarisation of 
            suppliers and distributors Ð the larger ones with strong brands and 
            more resources doing what is necessary to succeed at the top end, 
            with others perhaps focusing more down the line,&quot; adds O'Brien.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Regional perspective</b><br>
            According to Retail International, the shopping centre market in GCC 
            has reached a level of maturity that is commensurate with the US and 
            EU. So much so that clearly defined sub-markets are now emerging. 
            &quot;These are about to be joined by another exciting concept new to the 
            Middle East - The Outlet Mall,&quot; says Simon Thomson, an international 
            retail consultant and a fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
            Surveyors. <br>
            &quot;I would guess that the grocery retail market in the entire GCC is 
            in the region of $20 billion (RO7.70 billion),&quot; says IMES' O' Brien. 
            &quot;Without getting too hung up on definitions of what actually 
            constitutes a supermarket, the numbers give a feel of the 
            development of retailing across the region. While there is one 
            supermarket for every 22,000 people in the UAE, it is one for every 
            72,000 people in Saudi Arabia, and even more in Oman,&quot; he adds. <br>
            &quot;This is a very crude indicator of the catching up which has yet to 
            be done. I'm of course not for a minute suggesting that supermarket 
            penetration will ever reach the level of the UAE, but the gap will 
            certainly be reduced.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            <b>Global highlights</b><br>
            According to estimates presented by IMES Consultancy Ltd earlier 
            this year, consumers globally spend more than $18,000 trillion 
            (RO6,923.07 trillion) outside the home of which around $7,000 
            trillion (RO2,692.31 trillion) is in retail outlets. About $3.5-$4 
            trillion (RO1.35-RO1.54 trillion) is spent on groceries, $2.8 
            trillion (RO1.08 trillion) of which is spent on food. These are all 
            very big numbers and are difficult to comprehend. To put this in 
            context, however, OER estimates Oman accounts for less than 0.1 per 
            cent of the worldwide grocery retail market Ð a tiny drop in the 
            ocean. <br>
            Softness in the global economy has produced difficult times for 
            retailers. In 2001, total sales for the 200 largest retailers 
            reached $2.14 trillion (RO0.823 trillion), an increase of just 1.9 
            per cent from 2000. This gain was about even with global GDP growth 
            of 2.1 per cent, which was the lowest in nearly a decade. The retail 
            growth rate also was below the rate of global inflation, estimated 
            at 3 per cent.<br>
            The retail slowdown in 2001 was a continuation of a trend. In 2000, 
            sales for the top 200 retailers advanced 2.6 per cent, which was 
            below the healthy 5 per cent increase in 1999. Slower sales growth 
            in 2001 also was the result of fewer mega-mergers in the industry. 
            Instead of acquiring anew, retailers reportedly have been busy 
            integrating the deals made over the past several years.<br>
            The 10 largest retailers in 2001 were the same as in 2000; however, 
            some of the rankings shifted. Today, Wal-Mart is the leader, 
            followed by Carrefour Ð the same results as in the prior year. 
            Wal-Mart remains the force of change in the industry. Its operating 
            methods set the pace in the industry for everything from pricing 
            strategy to IT spending and vendor relationships.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The bottomline</b><br>
            Be it in Muscat or Massachusetts, while the big-wigs of the retail 
            mart slog it out, the consumer is having a great time what with the 
            deals and discounts on offer and more in the offing while the 
            quality of products and services is reaching ever-higher standards.
            <br>
            &quot;The fact that Oman, in particular Muscat, is becoming overloaded 
            with hypermarkets and superstores may be bad news for operators, but 
            perhaps good news for customers as the competing operators strive to 
            improve their quality, pricing and level of service in order to 
            maximise their market share,&quot; says Cluttons' Lowes. In contrast to 
            this, those retailers that don't dominate the market may be 
            condemned to being squeezed out altogether or needing to lick their 
            wounds and consolidate with suitors stuck in the same boat. <br>
            At the end of the day, the essence of retailing is selling 
            merchandise that does not return with customers that do.</font></p>

                        passengers and is capable of flying long-haul routes 
                        using up to 20 per cent less fuel while pumping out

                        use of high-tech plastic composites instead of aluminium. 
                        Up to 50 per cent of the primary structure of the plane 
                        — including the fuselage and wing — will be made of 
                        composites such as carbon-fibre. The composites used in 
                        the Dreamliner are also stronger and lighter than 
                        traditional materials, allowing the plane greater fuel

                        net profit dropped by more than a third in 2006-07 and 
                        it suffered a fourth-quarter loss owing to flight 
                        disruptions, legal probes and the sale of its

                        a 12-month comparison, to £290 million (425 million 
                        euros, $573 million) in the year to March 31, BA said in 
                        the annual earnings release. The fourth-quarter net loss

                        yesterday its biggest quarterly loss in four years as 
                        the PlayStation 3 battled fierce competition, but the 
                        Japanese electronics icon forecast profits would double 
                        this year. The company saw a mixed performance for the 
                        past financial year with net profits rising by about two 
                        per cent while operating earnings slumped by more than 
                        two-thirds as the video game division plunged deep into 
                        the red. Sony predicted a strong rebound in the current 
                        year thanks to expected strong sales of flat-screen 
                        televisions and other electronic goods and reduced 
                        losses at its video game division. Net losses came to 
                        67.56 billion yen ($562 million) for the three months to 
                        March, worse than the 66.53 billion yen loss Sony 
                        suffered a year earlier, the company said in a 
                        statement. Net profits for the year to March came to a 
                        better-than-expected 126.33 billion yen, up 2.2 per cent 
                        from a year earlier due to lower restructuring costs and 
                        a strong performance by its mobile telephone venture 
                        Sony Ericsson. But operating profits slumped by 68.3 per 
                        cent to 71.75 billion yen, hit by a 51.2 billion yen 
                        loss caused by the recalls of millions of Sony-made 
                        computer batteries and a price cut for the PlayStation

But Toyota predicted steady profits in the current year as an expected strengthening of the yen and slower sales growth put the brakes on its stellar performance. Toyota is enjoying flourishing sales, particularly in the United States, as sky-high gasoline prices boost demand for compact cars, small sport utility vehicles and hybrids which use a mix of electricity and petrol. Net earnings rose 19.8 per cent to 1.64 trillion yen (13.7 billion dollars) in the year to March, a fifth consecutive annual record and ahead of Toyota's own forecasts, a company statement said. Operating profit gained 19.2 per cent to 2.24 trillion yen while revenue increased 13.8 per cent to 23.95 trillion yen, helped by a weaker yen. In the fourth quarter alone, net earnings rose 8.9 per cent to 440.1 billion yen. Toyota overtook struggling US rival General Motors as the world's top selling automaker in the three months to March and is expected to remain the world number one through this year, ending GM's 76-year reign. Toyota, which marks the 70th anniversary of its founding this year, sold 8.52 million vehicles in the last fiscal year, up 6.9 per cent.</font><br>

                        workers and nine Chinese dead. China has said that

						China's economy could grow by 10.9 percent in 2007, up 
                        from 10.7 percent last year, according to a study quoted 
                        in state press. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 
                        forecast follows official figures released show growth 
                        of 11.1 percent in the first quarter, despite efforts to 
                        slow the economy. Investors and analysts expect further 
                        measures to put the brakes on China's economic engine, 
                        such as an interest rate hike. But they are not sure 
                        whether the plans will work. the authorities have set a 
                        target of eight percent growth in gross domestic 
                        product, which international organisations including the 
                        World Bank say is almost certain to be exceeded this 
                        year. The World Bank forecasts the rate of growth will 
                        shrink to 10 percent in 2007 before a sharper slowdown 
                        in 2008, due to strict measures adopted by Beijing. </font></p>

                        had submitted its offer at a recommended bid of 500 
                        pence per share, more than a 10 percent increase from 
                        its previous offer of 455 pence per share. Corus had 
                        last month agreed to be acquired by Tata for 5.1 billion 
                        pounds including debt, before Brazilian steelmaker CSN, 
                        or Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, made an informal 
                        offer of 5.3 billion pounds on November 17. Corus net

                        firm Hoogovens and British Steel, is Europe’s 
                        second-largest steel maker and the world’s 
                        ninth-largest, producing around 18 million tonnes per 
                        year. The Anglo-Dutch steel company employs 47,300 
                        people globally, including 24,000 in Britain and 11,400 
                        in the Netherlands. Tata Steel, meanwhile, produced more 
                        than five million tonnes in the year to March 2006 and 
                        aims to reach 7.5 million tonnes by 2008. </font></p>

						Initial public offerings in the GCC are expected to

                        IPOs in the first nine months of 2006 has exceeded $6.2 
                        billion, which is 45 per cent more than the same period 
                        in 2005 and demand for IPOs remains strong and is 
                        expected to maintain its momentum in the short-term at 
                        least. In the third quarter, four IPOs raised $1.7 
                        billion, exceeding the $1.5 billion raised in the second 
                        quarter this year. “Emaar the Economic City” and Sipchem 
                        were particularly large IPOs by GCC standards, and 
                        raised $680 million and $660 million, respectively. The 
                        other two IPOs were Gulf Navigation of the UAE and the 
                        Saudi Red Sea Housing Services. Demand for new offerings 
                        by regional investors continues to outstrip supply, and 
                        all IPOs were oversubscribed by several folds. <br>
                        Not surprisingly, Saudi Arabia, the biggest GCC market 
                        and economy, remains the most active IPO market with 
                        more than $2.3 billion raised in the first nine months 
                        of 2006. <br>
                        The UAE and Qatar markets were also active and raised 
                        $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The 
                        Bahraini IPO market was uncharacteristically active in 
                        2006 with $1 billion raised compared to only $6 million 
                        in 2005, and this was mainly due to the IPO of three 
                        Islamic banks targeting the Saudi market. </font></p>

						Sohar Refinery is set to start commercial operations by

                        performance test, a senior official of the company has 
                        said. The start-up operation of the $1.25 billion 
                        refinery in general was as good as expected. The 
                        refinery project, which was built by Japan's JGC 
                        Corporation on an EPC contract basis, has a crude unit 
                        with a capacity of 116,400 barrels per day (BPD) and a 
                        residue fluid catalytic cracking unit with a capacity of 
                        75,260 bpd. The major products of the new refinery 
                        include propylene, LPG, straight run naphtha, regular 
                        unleaded gasoline, premium unleaded gasoline, aviation 
                        fuel, diesel, fuel oil and sulphur. SRC recently started 
                        shipment of refined products on a small scale, following 
                        the trial run. It exports refined products through a 
                        joint venture oil trading firm — Oman Trading

						IMF and World Bank issued urgent appeals for world 
                        leaders to salvage trade liberalisation talks as Fund 
                        chief Rodrigo Rato warned the global economy may have 
                        almost peaked. World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz 
                        called on the United States to cut agricultural 
                        subsidies and better the lives of third world farmers. 
                        The WTO-sponsored talks, launched in the Qatari capital 
                        Doha in November 2001, were suspended in July amid deep 
                        disagreement on steps to end support for agriculture in 
                        the developed world, and demands that emerging and 
                        developing countries make their markets more accessible 
                        to industrial goods. International Monetary Fund 
                        Managing Director Rodrigo Rato described the suspension 
                        as deeply disappointing and damaging. &quot;It delays an 
                        agreement that would raise prosperity and support growth 
                        around the world, and it feeds a growing inclination 
                        towards at best bilateralism and at worst protectionism. 
                        The best hope for continued high growth lies in further 
                        increases in international trade,&quot; Rato said, adding 
                        that while momentum is currently healthy, &quot;the global 
                        growth cycle may be close to its peak”.</font></p>

						A recent report, Middle East and North Africa, Economic 
                        Developments and Prospects 2006 issued by the World 
                        Bank, ranked Oman as a leading country in the region 
                        which achieved substantial progress in management and 
                        restructuring of government’s institutions. The report 
                        published by World Bank on its website, said progress in 
                        Oman stood at 81 per cent in 2005. The Omani government 
                        granted a licence for private radio and TV stations for 
                        the first time, allowing greater information about 
                        domestic economic policies. The report said that Oman is 
                        one of the AGCC states which has capitalised on an 
                        increase in oil prices to reduce the amount of its 
                        internal debts, whereas the debt ratio fell by 11 per 
                        cent of the total GDP. The report said Oman had recently 
                        taken steps towards activation of policies considered an 
                        example to be followed by region’s governments. Oman had 
                        made substantial strides in economic development 
                        achieving 77.8 per cent in economic progress during the 
                        past three years. The report stated that Oman was the 
                        only country in the region in terms of trade openness 
                        and the only one to be classified in the top third of 
                        countries worldwide with regard to trade facilitation, 
                        whereas it topped the Arab countries in index of trade 
                        progress at 70.8 per cent. <br>

                        for $20 million. Boeing’s purchase of 16.5 million new 
                        common shares in Huneed was agreed late last month and 
                        completed with regulatory approval. Huneed is a leading

						GlaxoSmithKline Plc has agreed new-style flexible 
                        pricing deals with two European governments, allowing it 
                        to raise the price of some drugs once additional 
                        clinical data on their value is available. Andrew Witty, 
                        the company's head of pharmaceuticals in Europe said the 
                        novel pricing model -- which also allows for price cuts 
                        if medicines fail to offer value – could be adopted by 
                        many other governments in future. He declined to name 
                        the countries or medicines involved for competitive 
                        reasons. Several government, including France, have 
                        argued recently for a more flexible approach to valuing 
                        medicines, by rewarding truly innovative products with 
                        higher prices but cutting prices for those that are 
                        little different to existing drugs. Such a system was 
                        probably not needed for drugs with a short-term impact, 
                        like antibiotics, but could be a major boon for those to 
                        treat chronic diseases, whose true value to society only 
                        becomes clear after lengthy outcome studies. </font></p>

						Developing country finance ministers said that proposed 
                        reforms of International Monetary Fund voting rights 
                        failed to meet the needs of low-income IMF members. The 
                        ministers, convening as the Group of 24 ahead of the 
                        annual meeting here of the IMF and the World Bank, also 
                        called for an urgent resumption of stalled global trade 
                        liberalisation talks under the Doha Round. The G-24 in a 
                        statement hailed a decision by IMF directors to increase 
                        the voting rights in the fund of four emerging market 
                        nations, China, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey, that had 
                        been seen to be under-represented relative to their 
                        importance in the world economy. IMF Managing Director 
                        Rodrigo Rato is also seeking a broader reform by 2008 
                        that would affect the formula used to calculate an IMF 
                        member's quotas, which govern its access to funds and 
                        its voting clout. The G-24 called for &quot;a new quota 
                        formula that accurately reflects the relative economic 
                        size of developing countries in the world economy&quot;.</font></p>

						The Group of Seven rich nations urged China to let its 
                        currency rise faster to help ease perilous imbalances in 
                        trade and backed a rise in the yen to reflect Japan’s 
                        strengthening economic recovery. In a statement issued 
                        after an afternoon of talks, G7 finance ministers and 
                        central bank chiefs complained that large emerging 
                        economies were not pulling their weight in the 
                        collective management of the global economy. But 
                        Beijing, blamed by critics for holding the Yuan down to 
                        boost its exports, was the only country singled out by 
                        name. Europe is wary of the yen’s softness for fear that 
                        the euro will have to bear more of the burden of global 
                        currency adjustment. But Japanese Finance Minister 
                        Sadakazu Tanigaki, too, chimed in by saying the yen 
                        should mirror Japan’s fundamentals. China is pivotal 
                        because, without a sharp rise in the Yuan, its Asian 
                        neighbours will be reluctant to let their own currencies 
                        appreciate for fear of losing competitiveness. China 
                        revalued the Yuan, or Renminbi, by 2.1 per cent in July 
                        2005 and cut it free from a decade-old dollar peg. Since 
                        then the currency has risen only another 2 per cent. </font></p>

                        net compared to the previous year at RO13.44 million;

                        iBook G4 and PowerBook G4 computers, according to the

                        to Dowling. The Apple announcement came after Dell

                        batteries with Sony-made cells, also as a fire hazard.

                        competition from low-cost rivals, high fuel prices and 
                        salary costs. The carrier posted a net loss of Rs440 
                        million ($9 million) for the three months ended June 30 
                        compared with a net profit of Rs950 million a year

                        with low-cost carriers for passengers, said financial 
                        performance was hit by such factors as &quot;continued yield

                        passenger yield or average revenue per passenger in the 
                        first quarter was 9 per cent lower compared with last

                        since October 2004. The RBI has warned repeatedly this 
                        year of inflation risks from high global oil prices, 
                        rising house prices and fast credit growth. Bank credit 
                        grew 32 per cent in the year ended April, the fastest 
                        rate in three decades. On June 8, it surprised markets 
                        by raising rates by a quarter percentage point in a 
                        signal that the risk of higher inflation in India was 
                        increasing. In the weekly figures, India's inflation 
                        rate fell to 4.68 per cent from 4.96 per cent in the 
                        previous week and down sharply from its fastest rate in

                        “Zune” brand this year, in a belated attempt to 
                        challenge the dominance of Apple Computer Inc.’s iPod 
                        player. The announcement comes after weeks of rumours 
                        and speculation about such an offering. Microsoft has 
                        already touted the products to record companies. The 
                        world’s largest software maker faces an uphill climb in 
                        closing the gap on Apple’s iPod media player and iTunes 
                        Music Store, the runaway leaders in their respective 
                        areas. The iPod holds more than half of the digital 
                        media player market, according to research company NPD, 
                        while iTunes accounts for over 70 per cent of US digital 
                        music sales. </font></p>

                        operator. Block 56 was the consortium’s first choice 
                        block and the highest rated of the blocks on offer in 
                        the bid round that closed on January 1, 2006. The block 
                        is located onshore, adjacent to producing fields 
                        operated by Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) in the 
                        South Oman Salt Basin, which is the main producing basin

                        by 2008, whereas a report published by the Aberdeen

                        improved compliance by 50 per cent, reduced processing

                        released by the government. Oman had registered a trade 
                        surplus of more than RO3.7 billion in 2005 as compared 
                        to RO1.748 billion in 2004. Trade balance for the years

                        estimated at more than RO15 billion for the year 2005. 
                        The average price for Oman crude in March 2006 stood at 
                        $58.18 a barrel. In April 2006, the price rose further 
                        to $64.53 a barrel, recording an average price of $59.93

                        billion in Q1 2006. Oman’s import bill is increasing 
                        considerably, but to a healthy level. Once implemented, 
                        the Oman-US FTA is expected to further boost the

                        give a big boost to Oman’s GDP in the years to come.

                        will significantly augment supply to a city which

                        Investment is the largest growth engine, and the second

                        include enhanced oil recovery projects at Harweel and 
                        Qarn Alam. The growth in oil production of non-Opec 
                        countries this year is limited to 0.7 million barrels 
                        per day. The shortage of qualified and skilled 
                        professionals also poses a major challenge for the 
                        industry. The world demand for oil, which is 84 million 
                        barrels a day now, is expected to touch 138 million bpd 
                        by 2030. The demand for natural gas is equally 
                        increasing. The recent natural disaster in the United 
                        States and political problems aided the upsurge in oil 
                        prices. </font></p>

                        into mobile telephones with a $15 billion buy of 
                        Vodafone’s Japanese unit that could spark fierce price 
                        competition. Softbank will acquire the British mobile 
                        telephone operator’s entire 97.7 per cent stake in 
                        Vodafone K.K. for 1.75 trillion yen — one of Japan’s 
                        biggest ever acquisitions. Founded by Masayoshi Son, one 
                        of Japan’s richest men, the sprawling Softbank group has 
                        expanded by buying stakes in hundreds of companies and 
                        its latest deal gives it extra muscle to fight rivals 
                        NTT and KDDI. Softbank also agreed with the Vodafone 
                        group to explore the possibility of launching joint 
                        mobile content distribution services.</font></p>

                        a separate entity and continue to be led by its current 
                        management team. The Body Shop was founded in 1976 by 
                        Anita Roddick, who rapidly expanded the business from 
                        modest beginnings with a determination to offer products 
                        which had not been tested on animals and used natural 
                        products. Body Shop was a leader in the so-called 
                        ethical business sector and developed a high-profile 
                        brand. It has about 1,900 shops in 50 countries, with 
                        its main markets being Britain and the United States. It 
                        posted sales of £419.0 million (603.0 million euros, 
                        $735.0 million) in the 52 weeks to February 26.</font></p>

						validates the extension of the productive Upper Shuaiba 
						reservoir rock formation that PDO's geologists and 
						geophysicists had proposed after the discovery of the 
						Malaan field in 2004. The finds hold out the prospect of 
						further discoveries in the formation, and the current 
						drilling campaign will see up to 16 additional wells 
						drilled over the next 18 months. The finds are also 
						noteworthy in that both discovery wells were 
						contributing to PDO's oil production within two months 
						of being found. The two discoveries in the south —

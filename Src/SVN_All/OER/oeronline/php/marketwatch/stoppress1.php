          plans to sell to the public some $280 billion worth of state-owned 
          stocks as it seeks to right a flawed corporate ownership structure and 
          save its ailing securities markets. The government would support large 
          firms listing all their assets when the sale of state shares is 
          completed and encourage companies to merge through acquisitions, said 
          a nine-page inter-ministerial document. The overhaul is designed to 
          deal with the overhang of the state’s non-tradable shares, a problem 
          which has dogged China’s capital markets for years. Regulators tried 
          to resolve the overhang in 2001 to raise funding for China’s fledgling 
          social security system but panicked investors sent stocks plunging, 
          forcing authorities to shelve the plan.</font></p>

          <font face="Verdana" size="2">China's economic growth will soften to 
          nine per cent this year and about eight per cent in 2006 due to 
          slowing world trade and the modest revaluation of its currency, the 
          World Bank forecast. China's central bank last month also forecast 
          full-year GDP growth of nine per cent compared with 9.5 per cent last 
          year. The World Bank said the economic outlook for China remains good 
          in a stable macro-economic environment with favourable financial 
          conditions. The bank based its projection partly on global economic 
          factors, saying the growth in world economic activity and trade is 
          projected to slow from 12 per cent in 2004 to 6.4 per cent in 2005. 
          This would hit China's export growth. Exports would also be affected 
          somewhat by the modest revaluation of the Yuan and recent measures to 
          discourage exports of highly energy-intensive products. Among other 
          measures, exporters of aluminium and steel can no longer claim rebates 
          of value-added tax. Domestic investment growth and price pressures are 
          also expected to ease.</font></p>

          <font face="Verdana" size="2">Shell Oman Marketing Company has reported excellent results for the 
          half-year till June 2005, with un-audited profit after tax of RO3.75 
          million (2004: RO2.24 million), which is 68 per cent higher than that 
          achieved in the same period last year. This significant increase in 
          profit was due to higher sales revenues and a positive gross margin 
          growth. The company delivered a gross margin growth of 15.4 per cent 
          on a year-on-year basis, buoyed by the excellent performance of the 
          company’s retail, aviation and lubricants businesses. The retail 
          business continued to grow at 3.7 per cent, constituting a reasonable 
          share of the company’s market growth, thanks to improved customer 
          value proposition and the successful launch of Shell’s new fuel card. 
          The company also achieved a significant milestone in safety 
          performance by registering 403 workdays without any lost time 
          injuries. </font></p>

          a leadership position in the Oman market — and a very strong presence

          justifying the fixed exchange rate peg of the Omani Rial to the US 
          dollar also continue to be valid for Oman; hence there is no direct 
          implication of the Yuan revaluation for the RO or for Oman’s exchange 
          rate regime. On July 21, the central People’s Bank of China announced 
          the Yuan was delinked from the US dollar and now pegged to a basket of 
          unnamed currencies but only allowed a very modest flexibility to trade 
          in a 0.3 per cent band. This resulted in a 2.1 appreciation in the 
          value of the Yuan, which was pegged at 8.28 Yuan to the dollar for the 
          past 11 years but is now exchanged at 8.11 Yuan to the dollar. The 
          step is reportedly seen as a political move aimed at appeasing its 
          main trading partners like the US but is acclaimed by governments and 
          economists as the first step toward greater flexibility in China’s 
          forex regime.</font></p>

          <font face="Verdana" size="2">The government’s net oil revenue rose by 
          RO 359.7 million to touch RO 2,676.1 million last year, mainly on 
          account of a rise in international oil prices. The budget for last 
          year was drawn initially on the assumption of the average oil price of 
          $21 per barrel. However, the actual average price of oil realised for 
          Omani crude worked out to $34.42 a barrel last year. While oil revenue 
          went up by 15.5 per cent, non-oil revenue moved up even sharper by 
          37.9 per cent. Revenue from liquefied natural gas and oil condensates 
          last year stood at RO 373.7 million, which aided the increase in the 
          share of non-oil revenue. The CBO also said that last year’s budget 
          showed a surplus of RO 230 million despite an increase in expenditure 
          by RO 385 million over the planned expenditure. </font></p>

          conducting mergers and acquisition and spinning off a unit. The

          wanted to give local companies enough time to take defensive measures

          the economy from an oil-dependent state into a well-diversified nation 
          with more solid economic fundamentals. The economy grew 12.5 per cent 
          last year on strong growth in overall economic activity. The 
          government’s public finance account showed a net surplus of RO471 
          million in 2004. The economy is expected to witness solid growth in 
          2005 as well. Oman’s exports rose by 14 per cent in 2004 to more than 
          RO5.13 billion compared with RO4.5 billion recorded in 2003. Imports 
          vaulted 31 per cent to RO3.3 billion compared with RO2.5 billion. The 
          rising number of mega capital and labour intensive projects coming up 
          in Oman indicates that the economy is fast diversifying. Oman has been 
          encouraging the private sector to actively participate in the 
          nation-building process. Oman produces more than 767,000 barrels of 
          oil a day. A sharp increase in oil prices brought windfall profits for 
          Oman last year. Oman crude realised an average price of $34.42 a 
          barrel last year compared with the budgeted price of $21 a barrel, an 
          increase of $13.42 a barrel. The government increased public 
          expenditure by another RO301 million during the year, resulting in a 
          higher deficit of RO801 million as against the budgeted deficit of 
          RO500 million. Though the oil revenues were estimated at RO1.654 
          billion, it grew by a whopping RO1.252 billion to RO2.906 billion. 
          Thus the total actual revenues rose by nearly 43 per cent to RO4.177

          and that, if necessary, the EU will impose limits on Chinese imports 
          shortly after that. Speaking before talks with EU trade ministers in 
          Luxembourg later, he listed nine types of textiles in which the surge 
          in imports is of enough concern to justify looking at the option of 
          imposing limits. These included T-shirts, pullovers, mens' trousers, 
          blouses, stockings and socks, as well as women's overcoats, bras and

          $25 billion — primarily because of a higher oil import bill as fuel 
          prices rose to record levels in the past year. “If oil imports were

          $450 for the first time since 1988, as the US currency slumped to a

          was the highest level since June 1988. The euro rose above $1.32 
          yesterday for the first time, as the US currency buckled under the 
          strain of imbalances in the American economy. A weaker dollar makes 
          gold, which is priced in the US currency on world markets, more 
          attractive to buyers using other currencies. Gold is seen also as a

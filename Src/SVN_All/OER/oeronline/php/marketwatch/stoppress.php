						positive investor sentiment and record high oil prices,&quot; 
						said analysts at Barclays Capital. They added: 
						&quot;Geopolitical concerns have come on the back of Turkey

						combat Kurdish rebels while ... crude oil prices have

						contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November, 
						surged to an historic $87.97 per barrel, while London 
						Brent oil hit a record $84.31. Gold prices are boosted 
						by record high oil prices, which in turn spark

                        Europe as the dollar’s continued slide to record lows 
                        versus the euro raised the metal’s appeal to speculative 
                        investors. Prices later eased as some investors pocketed 
                        profits, but overall sentiment remained bullish, traders 
                        and analysts said. The euro raced to an all-time high at 
                        $1.4120 as the US currency came under heavy selling 
                        pressure on expectations of further interest rate cuts 
                        in the United States. The European single currency leapt 
                        past $1.41 for the first time since its creation in 1999 
                        amid a Federal Reserve warning that US mortgage market 
                        woes could worsen. Other precious metals also advanced, 
                        with silver rising to its highest in more than three 
                        months, platinum hitting its highest since early May and 
                        palladium touching a five-week peak. Spot gold rose as 
                        high as $739 an ounce, its highest since January 1980, 
                        also boosted by technical buying and short-covering. It 
                        was quoted at $732.50/733.30 by 11:16 a.m. EDT, against 
                        $734.20/735.00 in New York late. A weaker US currency 
                        makes dollar-denominated metals cheaper for investors in 
                        other currencies, while gold is also seen as a hedge 
                        against oil-led inflation. Oil rose above $82 a barrel,

                        interest rate cut on Tuesday will help boost a slowing

                        yen to change hands at 115.97. The dollar slipped to 
                        115.79 yen. Traders, however, said the dollar is 
                        expected to weaken in the long term, once investors 
                        again look at rate differentials. The weakness of dollar 
                        sent gold prices on their way to 28-year highs. In 
                        London, gold prices surged to $726.70 per ounce in 
                        morning trade, last seen in May 2006. Earlier in the 
                        day, the Bank of Japan kept rates unchanged as expected 
                        at 0.50 per cent. The Bank of Japan’s policy board voted 
                        8-1 on Wednesday to keep the overnight call rate at 0.5 
                        per cent, where is has been since February. The Bank of

						playsets. No Barbie dolls were included. Mattel

						(www.service.mattel.com) to establish whether they own 
						an affected toy. After they fill out a form and send 
						back the affected parts, Mattel will send them 
						replacement and bonus parts. The recall arose out of

						already had announced two recalls of millions of Chinese 
						toys due to excessive amounts of lead paint and other 
						dangers. A spate of toy recalls has sparked concern over

                        for Asia's second biggest economy will provide fresh 
                        evidence that Beijing's economic braking measures have 
                        had little effect. China's sizzling economy expanded 
                        even faster than originally thought last year, with the 
                        government revising 2006 growth domestic product (GDP) 
                        to 11.1 percent from 10.7 percent. Data released by 
                        China's statistics bureau last week showed the economy 
                        was worth 21.09 trillion Yuan in 2006, about 2.65 
                        trillion dollars based on last year's average exchange 
                        rate of 7.97 Yuan to the dollar. The revision puts China 
                        in striking distance of Europe's largest economy within 
                        months. According to the World Bank, Germany's economy 
                        was worth 2.9 trillion dollars at the end of 2006.

                        equal its breathtaking January to March pace of 11.1 
                        percent growth. </font></p>

                Chester Elton a motivation expert, has been featured in The Wall 
                Street Journal, Washington Post, Fast Company magazine and the 
                New York Times. He is a recognition consultant to Fortune 100 
                firms such as DHL, KPMG, Wal-Mart and the Avis Budget Group. 
                Elton is a keynote speaker at the 2009 Leaders in Dubai Business

                <b>Do you see the Middle East and Asia leading the world out of 
                the financial crisis?</b><br>
                All developed countries will be a part of the solution, and the 
                Middle East and Asia are vital to that recovery. There is no 
                question there cannot be a full recovery without their 
                participation.<br>
                <br>

                <b>Will the financial crisis slow down poverty alleviation work 
                and programmes to control climate change?</b><br>
                It may actually help. As businesses and economies rebuild, there 
                will be a greater emphasis on ‘green.’ The issue of climate 
                change will be at the forefront of rebuilding of the global 
                economy.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What lessons have you learned from the financial meltdown 
                over the past 12 months?</b><br>
                First, we have learned that we need to value people over 
                numbers. When we make decisions on how we grow our businesses, 
                we need to keep the human effect as our key priority. How our 
                decisions as leaders will affect our people has been lost in the 
                blizzard of numbers. It is time to get back to the value of 
                people in business - to treat them not as costs of doing 
                business but as value creators. In the end, the collective 
                strength of our people will pull us out of this crisis.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What is the single most important thing that concerns you or 
                fills you with hope in the world today?</b><br>
                The strength of families is my greatest hope and my greatest 
                concern. Where you see strong family ties with respect for 
                parents and elders you see strong communities and strong 
                economies. Where families are torn apart by war and economic 
                collapse you see societies erode and economies contract. 
                Wherever we can build good schools for our children and good 
                jobs in our countries that can support strong families you see 
                peace and prosperity. It is my greatest hope when I see parents 
                that love and provide for their children and elders and my 
                biggest fear when I see parts of the world where this is not 
                possible through political corruption or war.<br>
                <br>
                <b>You believe that recognition is one of the most important 
                management tools; can you share with us some of your general 
                recognition tips?</b><br>
                After working with some of the world’s most successful companies 
                and managers, we have found that effective non-cash recognition 
                is frequent, specific and timely. That may sound simple like 
                most business concepts. The profound part is executing that 
                strategy. Recognition should be frequent - every seven days - to 
                communicate what we value most. It should be specific to your 
                core organisational goals, because rewarded behaviour gets 
                repeated and we want the right behaviours repeated.<br>
                <br>
                And finally, recognition can’t wait until a year-end bonus or 
                performance review. It must be timely to show that we are paying 
                attention and value employee efforts. When employees are 
                sincerely rewarded for their great work it changes everything.<br>

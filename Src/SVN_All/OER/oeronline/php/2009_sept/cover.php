                Xavier Crasta delves into the industry to find out where it stands 
                at this point in time</b><img border="0" src="images/img31.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5"><b><br>
                <br>
                </b>Since the invention of the automobile in 1885, at the hands 
                of Karl Benz, the automotive industry has grown well beyond what 
                Benz himself would have imagined. In 2008, more than 70mn motor 
                vehicles were produced worldwide. At the end of 2007 there were 
                about 806mn cars and light trucks on the roads worldwide, burning 
                over 260bn gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel annually. These 
                numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in markets such as 
                India and China. In fact China became the largest automobile market 
                in the world in 2009. Unfortunately, an industry of such size 
                and scale, that is so heavily dependent on oil, has a major Achilles 
                heel.<br>
                <br>
                The global financial crisis that began in September 2007 has taken 
                its toll on the fortunes of the automotive industry. To be honest 
                it wasn’t just the recession that affected the industry, it was 
                a combination of factors working in tandem that brought it to 
                its knees. Factors like the rise in oil prices, increasing cost 
                of raw materials, changes in buying patterns and growing environmental 
                concerns have been playing havoc with the automotive industry 
                during the last few years and the current crisis proved to be 
                the proverbial final nail in the coffin. The high expectations 
                that manufacturers had, following the relatively good sales figures 
                of previous years, didn’t help matters either. “Prior to the global 
                market slump, a lot of businesses, including automobile manufacturing, 
                was mostly about national pride and emotion, now though it is 
                all a question of sustainability and not really economic patriotism,” 
                says Annurag Chawla, head of marketing and communications – Mazda, 
                Towell Auto Centre. Despite this the automotive sector worldwide 
                seems to be pulling through, although not completely unscathed.

                <b>The worst hit</b><br>
                <img border="0" src="images/img32.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="5"> 
                Detroit, the hub of automobile manufacturing in the US took a 
                beating. Out of the ‘Big Three’, which include Ford, General Motors 
                (or GM as it is more commonly known) and Chrysler, only Ford Motor 
                Company has managed to relatively hold itself together, despite 
                a significant slump in global sales in 2008. GM filed for Chapter 
                11 bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009. It was, in terms of 
                assets, the fourth-largest bankruptcy in US history. But, at the 
                same time, it was also one of the largest successful reorganisations 
                in US history. The “new GM,” is formed from the purchase of the 
                desirable assets of “old GM” by an entity called “NGMCO Inc.” 
                via the bankruptcy process. NGMCO Inc. was renamed “General Motors 
                Company” upon purchase of the assets and trade name from “old 
                GM,” with the claims of former stakeholders to be handled by the 
                “Motors Liquidation Company.” Originally GM was the owner of Buick, 
                Cadillac, Chevrolet, Daewoo, GMC, Holden, Hummer, Opel, Pontiac, 
                Saab, Saturn and Vauxhall. Following the restructuring GM will 
                take control of eight brands but would primarily focus on its 
                four core brands – Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC. The Pontiac 
                brand and all of its models will be phased out by the end of 2010. 
                On June 16, 2009 it was confirmed that Koenigsegg, a Swedish super-car 
                maker named after its founder Christian von Koenigsegg, and a 
                group of Norwegian financers were chosen by GM as the buyers of 
                the Saab brand. On June 5, 2009, GM announced that they would 
                be selling Saturn and Saturn Distribution Corporation to the Penske 
                Automotive Group, the world’s second largest automotive dealership 
                group and a member of the Fortune 500 and Russell 2000.<br>

                <img border="0" src="images/img33.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5"> 
                As for Hummer, on June 2, 2009, it was confirmed that a Chinese 
                company, Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company, 
                would be buying the iconic US brand. But, it seems that Hummer 
                for the most part will remain based in the US due to environment 
                and other concerns. “GM has 100 years of experience and leadership 
                in the automobile business and is well on its way to the next 
                100 years of growth. GM has taken very decisive steps to shed 
                the unprofitable parts of their business, to cut overheads and 
                to streamline processes, after which it is emerging a more lean, 
                efficient and profitable company,” says Satbir Singh, general 
                manager – GMC, Moosa Abdul Rahman Hassan &amp; Co.<br>
                <br>
                Just over one month prior to GM’s bankruptcy filing, Chrysler 
                also filed for Chapter 11, on April 30. Later it was announced 
                that Chrysler was selling some assets and operations to the newly 
                formed company ‘Chrysler Group’ and that Fiat will hold a 20 per 
                cent stake in the new company, with an option to increase this 
                to 35 per cent and eventually to 51 per cent. According to Chris 
                Edwards, general manager – Chrysler, Shanfari Automotive <br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="images/img34.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="5"> 
                Company, “The two companies would seem very well suited for each 
                other, in that they have vertically opposed product line-ups. 
                Chrysler has, for many years, catered to the American market and 
                other potential international markets such as the Middle East, 
                while Fiat has perfected small-engine technology and efficiency. 
                This will obviously suit the transformation of Chrysler into a 
                more modern and efficient company.” Keith Dotson, general manager 
                – Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep, Zubair Automotive says, “All things 
                considered Chrysler is in good shape. They came out of the reorganisation 
                with the partnership of Fiat and are currently reviewing their 
                strategies.” Regardless of their current standing, both Chrysler 
                and GM have somehow recovered from their losses and are now much 
                stronger than they were before.<br>
                <br>
                And the malaise is not just limited to US automakers. Toyota Motor 
                Corporation (TMC) reported a loss of $4.4bn for the year ending 
                March 2009. But so far it is holding its ground by taking some 
                firm steps to reduce its losses in the coming year. TMC’s president 
                Katsuaki Watanabe commented on the outlook in a press release: 
                “In the 2010 fiscal year, we plan to accelerate our profit improvement 
                activities including the expansion of our hybrid vehicle line-up 
                such as the next generation Prius in May and the Lexus’ HS250h 
                in July. All totalled, we plan to launch four hybrid models in 
                Japan and three models overseas within this fiscal year.” <br>

                Unfortunately for Tata Motors, India, it was soon after their 
                takeover of Jaguar and Land Rover that the subprime crisis hit, 
                leaving them seeking financial aid. But it seems that this has 
                been sorted out – according to David Aziz, director automotive 
                products – Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo, MHD, “Tata has remained 
                committed towards sustaining the two brands despite the slump. 
                Both the brands are investing on facelifts on existing models 
                and also on new models, such as the new Jaguar XJ. Tata has also 
                managed to secure long-term funding for the two brands from the 
                European Investment Bank, totaling about $560mn, without necessitating 
                guarantees from the UK government.”<br>
                <br>
                Honda’s decision to withdraw it’s participation from the F1 scene 
                was a direct result of the global economic crisis. “Honda was 
                spending in excess of $300mn a year just to compete. Given the 
                crisis in the auto sector, Honda recognised the need to urgently 
                rationalise their business in order to protect their automobile 
                operations” says Paul Turner, national sales manager – Honda, 
                OMASCO. Aside from Honda’s withdrawal from F1, the business has 
                been relatively unharmed. The only real change in their operations 
                is the focus towards the development of new mainstream volume 
                models and next generation fuel technologies.<br>
                <br>
                Ssangyong is another company that has posted a significantly large 
                loss of $75.42mn. The company has temporary halted production 
                and is now in the process of restructuring itself. Aside from 
                the brands mentioned above, others have also had a rough year 
                but are confident of bouncing back as the global economic sentiment 
                improves.<br>

                A few manufacturers, such as Audi and Suzuki, have been relatively 
                unharmed by the current situation. In fact, in 2008, Audi achieved 
                the 13th record year in a row passing the one million unit mark 
                with 1,003,400 units sold. Suzuki announced that their worldwide 
                sales have passed the 40mn units mark. “Suzuki is one among the 
                very few Japanese car manufacturers which was not as hard hit 
                as compared to some of its counterparts. It survived tough business 
                conditions to end the financial year in the black, as it reacted 
                early to the economic crisis, adjusting production to match demand. 
                Also, an upsurge in sales, in the domestic Japanese market and 
                Indian markets, helped balance the situation,” says Anil Sethi, 
                general manager – Suzuki, Moosa Abdul Rahman Hassan &amp; Co. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, China’s automotive industry has been in rapid development 
                since the year 2000 despite the slump in the economy. In 2008, 
                9.34mn motor vehicles were manufactured in China. This has enabled 
                it to surpass the US as the second largest automobile maker, after 
                Japan. A number of Chinese brands like Geely and Great Wall have 
                opened outlets in Oman. So, although things are challenging for 
                now the industry is confident about the future.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Battle for control</b><br>
                <img border="0" src="images/img39.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5"> 
                Not all movement within the industry is actually related to the 
                current crisis. Companies have been changing hands all the time 
                and for the most part customers will be relatively unaffected 
                by these deals. This is because as a standard operating practice 
                the existing dealer network and all general assets of a company 
                get transferred as part of the deal. <br>
                <br>
                This should calm any anxiety that customers watching the ongoing 
                negotiations between Porsche and Volkswagen (VW) may be having. 
                It started with Porsche’s announcement in September 2005, that 
                it would increase its five per cent stake in VW to 20 per cent 
                at a cost of three billion Euros. This was supposedly done to 
                ward off any hostile takeover from foreign investors. Porsche 
                gradually increased its stake in the company to 25.1 per cent 
                in July 2006 and then to 30.9 per cent on March 2007. But it was 
                not until October 26, 2008 that Porsche finally revealed its plan 
                to assume control of VW. As of that day, it held 42.6 per cent 
                of VW’s ordinary shares and stock options on another 31.5 per 
                cent. However, at an extraordinary meeting held on August 13, 
                2009, the Volkswagen group’s supervisory board approved the comprehensive 
                agreement to create an integrated automotive group with Porsche 
                led by Volkswagen by 2011. One day later Qatar bought 10 per cent 
                of the Porsche SE holding company as well as the options that 
                Porsche held on 20 per cent of VW shares.<br>
                <br>
                Under this agreement, Volkswagen will initially take a 42 per 
                cent stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009 and it will also see 
                the family <img border="0" src="images/img38.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="5">shareholders 
                selling the automobile trading business of Porsche Holding Salzburg 
                to Volkswagen. Porsche will remain an independent company headquartered 
                in Zuffenhausen with the joint group owning ten strong brands. 
                “At the end of the day, they are treated as individual businesses 
                but behind the scenes they have shared components for many years. 
                This can only be a positive for customers because the bigger and 
                broader a companies capabilities, the more efficient it’s going 
                to be in terms of R&amp;D and production” says Andrew Potts, dealer 
                principal – Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda etc; Wattayah Motors.<br>

                Some years back it would have been impossible to picture legendary 
                sports car manufacturers like Porsche and Aston Martin producing 
                luxury sedans and SUVs. Porsche was a trendsetter of sorts with 
                the Cayenne and now with the eagerly awaited Panamera. And Aston 
                Martin is following suite with the upcoming Rapide. Even Lamborghini 
                recently delved into the concept with the Estoque. If you are 
                a dedicated fan of these companies it is sometimes hard to accept 
                these changes, but the fact remains that it is not necessarily 
                a bad move to expand your range. Claudio Piretti, general manager 
                – Ferrari and Maserati, Shanfari Automotive Company, says “Aside 
                from being a part of the expansions strategy, the current market 
                situation dictates a need to reduce costs by getting volumes.”<br>
                <br>
                To keep the price of future cars at a level that is acceptable, 
                erstwhile niche market manufacturers realise that they need to 
                play the volume game. There are two ways of doing this – one, 
                by selling their technology to another company for a monetary 
                value or introducing a model in a segment that was not their forte 
                initially. And the latter is what most established players are 
                opting for. As an added advantage the company retains control 
                over its proprietary technology. There is also another key advantage 
                to doing so – What happens to a man who drives a Aston Martin 
                DB9 when he has a family? In all likelihood he stops being an 
                Aston Martin customer due of space constraints. This is the hassle 
                that most manufacturers of this type face. Now they have given 
                him an option to stay within the brand but still have a vehicle 
                to take his family around in.<br>

                <font size="1" face="Verdana">In lieu of the growing fuel prices and environmental concerns, 
                the need for more fuel efficient and greener vehicles is on the 
                rise. Given these facts a number of manufacturers are well on 
                their way to developing these technologies. But, the biggest question 
                is – Which technology will take over as the primary source of 
                power for the vehicles of tomorrow?<br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately, the answer for this question at this point in time 
                is shrouded in uncertainty. It is a well known fact that the various 
                R&amp;D divisions of the manufacturers analyse and predict the 
                markets for as far as 15 years into the future. Despite this no 
                one has come to a conclusive answer as to what will be the next 
                generation fuel that will power the vehicles of the future. Audi 
                for one, believes it to be electric power while Bentley thinks 
                in the way of flexfuels and Honda is placing its bets on Hydrogen 
                fuel cells. But what is certain is that the change to these fuels 
                will not be a quick one. Mark Tomlinson, general manager – Mitsubishi, 
                General Automotive Company believes so, “What we will see is, 
                rather than a direct shift from petrol engines, is a transitional 
                period with more fuel efficient vehicles and hybrids. But the 
                ultimate shift is going to take quite a long time.” One of the 
                primary reasons for this is the time required to setup the infrastructure 
                needed to make these vehicles a viable commercial alternative. 
                The cost of producing and purchasing such vehicles still remains 
                prohibitive, limiting their appeal.<br>

                <b>Fuelling the future</b><br>
                Not all sources are as clean as they seem. Hydrogen for one is 
                considered a zero emissions fuel but in truth, the amount of energy 
                neede<img border="0" src="images/img43.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5">d 
                to produce it and the material used to make the cells are far 
                from environment friendly at present. And electric cars are also 
                in need of power which in turn is not always produced using the 
                most eco friendly methods. With time comes improvement in technology 
                and efficiency, and what may not be a feasible option today may 
                be the one that motorists of tomorrow may end up using. “Different 
                manufacturers are embarking on different initiatives, in the race 
                to be ready for what will eventually be accepted as the standard. 
                Under its umbrellas of Clean Energy and Efficient Dynamics, BMW 
                is presently working on at least two – the Hydrogen-fuelled car 
                and the Electric car. Today, no one can predict which will be 
                the winning solution. It is all a matter of which manufacturer 
                does it best first, both from a customer standpoint as well as 
                what is embraced by governments in most of the developed world,” 
                says Johnny Oommen, head of operations – Rolls-Royce, BMW and 
                MINI, Al Jenaibi Int’l Automobiles. As of now it seems that hybrid 
                vehicles are the way to go as they are the perfect mediator till 
                a more viable source is found.<br>
                <br>
                As for these hybrid vehicles coming to this region, it seems that 
                there is still time. S Serdar Toktamis, acting group general manager, 
                Zubair Automotive Group, says “The global situation today is very 
                unpredictable and you really can’t tell what will happen tomorrow. 
                As long as we have oil here in the GCC and fuel prices remain 
                as reasonable as they are, I don’t see any of them making it here 
                in the short term to be honest.” James Oliver, dealer principal 
                – Citroen, Great Wall and Peugeot, European Motors, adds, “The 
                GCC market alone cannot dictate what needs to be built. The choice 
                will rest on the major companies themselves. Around the world 
                manufacturers are building more economical and efficient vehicles 
                based on the demand. Eventually <img border="0" src="images/img44.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="5">the 
                choice of the big V8’s will disappear altogether.” But what will 
                this hold in store for muscle cars and high-performace sports 
                coupes? Only time will tell.<br>
                <br>
                For now it is important to remain positive. Keeping this in mind, 
                VR Dilip, chief operating officer – Hummer, Chevrolet, Hyundai 
                etc; OTE, concludes, “A lot of churn is taking place which will 
                benefit customers and keep companies healthy. And if the result 
                of all this is greener vehicles which consume less energy and 
                lead to a cleaner environment then it is fantastic. This crisis 
                has accelerated the development of green cars and this is the 
                silver lining.” We could not agree more and from what one can 
                see, the industry will come out of this crisis stronger than ever 
                before.<b><br>

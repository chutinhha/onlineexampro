                    2009 is an extraordinary year for the German premium 
                carmaker Audi. This year it celebrates its 100th birthday and 
                what better way to celebrate it than to take a look at its rich 
                and illustrious history. Malcolm Xavier Crasta reports from 
                Audi’s headquarters in Ingolstadt<br>
                <br>
                With “100 years of Audi on the Donauring” – Audi celebrated the 
                brand’s centenary in Ingolstadt on July 18. On the historic 
                circuit in the old town, almost every vehicle that bears witness 
                to Audi’s historic racing successes was on view to the public, 
                from the 1934 Auto Union Type A to the current R15 Le Mans 
                entry. In the light of such a momentous event in Audi’s 
                illustrious history, it is only right to hark back to the days 
                of its creation and see just what made Audi what it is today.<br>
                <br>
                Audi’s story starts with August Horch, born on October 12, 1868 
                in Winningen, Moselle. He studied in Mittweida and worked for 
                Karl Benz from 1896, before founding A Horch &amp; Cie in November 
                1899, in Cologne, Germany. The first car to bear his name saw 
                the light of day in 1901. Later, the company moved to 
                Reichenbach in 1902 and then to Zwickau in 1904. In 1909, a 
                dispute within the company forced him to leave. In turn he 
                decided to compete with his former colleagues by establishing 
                another company in the very same place; he named it Horch 
                Automobil-Werke GmbH. His former partners sued him for trademark 
                infringement and a German court determined that the Horch brand 
                belonged to his former company. Having been forced to look for a 
                new name, he called for a meeting to come up with a new name for 
                his company. It was decided that the Latin translation of his 
                name would be used; hence Audi was finally founded in 1909. 
                Horch was fascinated by motorsport and established the sporting 
                reputation of his newly founded brand as early as 1914 with wins 
                in the Alpine rally, the toughest reliability test of the day. 
                Later, in 1920, Horch left Audi for a high position at the 
                ministry of transport, but he was still involved with Audi as a 
                member of the board of trustees. One year later, in September 
                1921, Audi became the first German car manufacturer to present a 
                production car with left-hand drive, the Audi Type K. The logo 
                with the four rings was adopted in 1932 with the fusion of Audi, 
                DKW, Horch and Wanderer.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Down memory lane</b><br>
                With the onset of World War II came the retooling of the Auto 
                Union plants for military production. Soon after they were 
                subjected to heavy bombing which lasted for the rest of the war, 
                leaving them severely damaged. Over run by the Russian Army, in 
                1945, and on the orders of the Soviet Union military 
                administration, they were dismantled as part of war reparations. 
                This also included the expropriation of the company’s entire 
                assets without compensation and the deletion of Auto Union AG 
                from the commercial register, effectively liquidating the 
                company on August 17, 1948. A reformed Auto Union was launched 
                in Ingolstadt, Bavaria on September 3, 1949. From here on it was 
                success after success and with the Volkswagen Group acquiring 
                the factory in Ingolstadt and the trademark rights of the Auto 
                Union, things could only get better. <br>
                <br>
                The first ever production vehicle with four-wheel drive - The 
                Quattro - was debuted in 1980 at the Geneva Motorshow with the 
                Urquattro and soon celebrated legendary rally successes in the 
                World Rally Championships. The success did not stop there: Pikes 
                Peak, DTM and Le Mans all brought success, experience and 
                passion to push innovation further. In 1989 Audi introduced 
                turbo diesel direct injection, which even today remains ahead of 
                its time. In the same year, where terms such as ‘greenhouse 
                effect’ and ‘carbon footprints’ were still unheard of, Audi 
                engineers developed the Audi Duo, the forerunner of hybrid 
                technology featuring solar panels, a gasoline engine supported 
                by a nine-kilowatt electric motor and nickel-cadmium batteries, 
                that could be recharged either by the on-board generator or by a 
                standard electricity socket. In 1994, Audi pioneered the Audi 
                Space Frame, an aluminium frame structure and integrated panels 
                that not only resulted in exceptional rigidity and high crash 
                protection, but also substantially lower weight. In 2000, the 
                Audi A2 capable of using only three litres of diesel over 100 
                kms was launched and in 2007 we saw the first vehicle with LED 
                daytime running lights and headlights - the Audi R8. Over the 
                past 100 years, Audi continually reinvented itself and built the 
                basis for continued future success. “Vorsprung durch Technik” 
                (Advancement through Technology in German) has become a way of 
                life and the way into the future for Audi as one of the most 
                established German automotive giants today.<br>

                    <b>Leasing has not caught on as an alternative to outright 
                    purchase in Oman, but the scenario is steadily changing. Malcolm 
                    Xavier Crasta delves into the various aspects of the business</b><br>
                    <br>
                    In these financially tough times, paying a large amount of 
                    money for a car or household furnishings can deter quite a 
                    few. But customers need not despair as a number of companies 
                    in Oman are rolling out attractive leasing offers. Leasing 
                    offers consumer’s the benefit of using an asset without paying 
                    a large sum of initial cash. A lease regularly requires no 
                    down payment, while loans frequently do. Leasing can also 
                    come in handy for people who are in a country for a limited 
                    period of time as this takes away the burden of a used asset 
                    that they have to rid themselves off when leaving. <br>

                    <b>Take a pick</b><br>
                    Says Nikhil Krishnankutty, general manager, Towell Furniture, 
                    a one-stop-shop for an individual or corporates who want furniture 
                    for a home or office, “We provide a wide range of designs 
                    of all forms <img border="0" src="images/img53.jpg" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="6" width="176" height="286">of 
                    living, dining, bedroom, outdoor and office furniture that 
                    can be made available on affordable instalments so there is 
                    no burden on newcomers, or the company paying for this furniture,” 
                    he adds, “Our normal rental periods for long term rentals 
                    are generally for two years.” Naturally, all products are 
                    available for outright purchase should that be the customer’s 
                    need. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sometimes expatriates come only for a short assignment or 
                    may come in advance either before their families join them 
                    and they actually set up home. In certain cases their own 
                    furniture takes time to arrive. For such cases, Towell Furniture 
                    provides furniture on short term rentals ranging from 2-6 
                    months to service this “temporary” need. When the customers 
                    furniture arrives, the transition is almost seamless. The 
                    employee enjoys convenience and the company saves on exorbitant 
                    hotel costs or duplication of unutilised house rental costs 
                    while the home is being set up in ordinary circumstances. 
                    In addition, a consumer need not worry about disposing his 
                    own furniture at a virutally negligible value when leaving 
                    the country or even when he chooses to change his furniture 
                    after a few years.<br>
                    <br>
                    All companies strive to save money which becomes even more 
                    of a mandate in a recessionary climate where there is a reluctance 
                    to spend lump sums on capital asset purchases. Towell Furniture’s 
                    offering allows such companies to avail of the same service 
                    and utility at a fraction of what they would have paid for 
                    an outright purchase, which favourably affects cash flow and 
                    more importantly, it can be written off as an “expense” rather 
                    than listed as an asset on the balance sheet. The company 
                    also has the flexibility to determine the exact period it 
                    wants to lease these assets – so in truth, there is no wastage, 
                    and the assets that are provided are utilised from day one 
                    to the end of the required period. Says Krishnankutty, “We 
                    differentiate ourselves in the market by providing a hassle 
                    free and competitive rental service.” <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Rental service</b><br>
                    A number of companies in the market offer car rental services. 
                    Most of them offer very similar plans with minor variations, 
                    primarily relating to the range of vehicles you can lease. 
                    Usually, but not always, leasing directly from deal<img border="0" src="images/img54.jpg" align="right" hspace="7" vspace="6" width="177" height="290">erships 
                    that provide the facility is limited to their range of vehicles 
                    as is the case with Wattayah Motors, but sometimes with the 
                    benefit of a better deal, whereas with third party companies 
                    like Mark Rent-a-Car your options are only limited by the 
                    various cars in the country and deals can be worked out over 
                    a wide range of cars. The former is beneficial to individuals 
                    and companies looking for a fleet from a single dealer. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    “Since the vehicle is supplied directly from the dealer who 
                    have expert staff and full access to manufacturer information. 
                    This will always ensure that the car meet the customer’s requirements. 
                    Additional aftersales benefits are the same as any customer 
                    who would buy a car directly from Wattayah,” says Andrew Potts, 
                    dealer principal, Wattayah Motors. The latter is beneficial 
                    to companies looking for a number of vehicles from multiple 
                    dealerships. “When a client has a need for various types of 
                    vehicles it would be of advantage for the client to deal with 
                    only one company and also this would give him a better leverage 
                    to negotiate the best price,” says Alex Crasta, manager, Mark 
                    car rental and chauffer service. Prices can vary greatly so 
                    it is always advisable to scout around before making your 
                    <br>
                    final decision. <br>
                    <br>
                    The largest benefit of leasing a vehicle is the coverage the 
                    vehicle has in terms of maintenance, as it is entirely covered 
                    by the agreement. And at the end of the term, it is general 
                    practice to offer a deal whereby the customer can purchase 
                    the car or just hand it back to the company. But there are 
                    two important factors to note while leasing a car. Firstly, 
                    leasing plans can be worked out from one year onwards but 
                    it is always advisable to at least work out a three-year contract 
                    as this brings down the cost significantly. Second, it is 
                    possible to foreclose a deal but as a general practice this 
                    is possible only after a one year period and depending on 
                    the agreement, the rental amount for a certain number of months 
                    is taken as a cancellation fee. Overall though it is a great 
                    form of hassle free motoring. So if you wish to drive your 
                    dream car or the bring home that piece of furniture that will 
                    add to the aesthetics of your house, go ahead and buy it if 
                    you can, if not lease it.<br>

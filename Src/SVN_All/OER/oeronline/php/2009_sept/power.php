                    United Power Company was the first Independent Power Project 
                    (IPP) in the Middle East. The project started on a small scale 
                    in 1994, when Tractebel SA (now GDF Suez) and prominent local 
                    business groups, National Trading, WJ Towell, The Zubair Corporation 
                    and Tawoos (subsequently sold to Ministry of Defence Pension 
                    Fund) signed an agreement with the government. The project 
                    was conceived by the Ministry of Electricity and Water under 
                    the guidance and leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin 
                    Said. It is said that the people of Nizwa raised the power 
                    shortage issue during one of His Majesty’s visit leading to 
                    this project being set-up at Manah (near Nizwa).<br>
                    <br>
                    Since there was no precedent of a standard long term power 
                    purchase agreement (PPA), it took three years for the PPA 
                    to be put into a legal framework. UPC started as a small project 
                    with a 90MW capacity. There were three machines of 30MW each. 
                    The debt-equity ratio was 67:33 per cent. Apart from production, 
                    UPC was also responsible for transmission network from Manah/Nizwa 
                    to the main grid and some other areas near Nizwa. The biggest 
                    challenge in the initial stages was getting international 
                    funding as international lenders had not done any significant 
                    project finance transactions in Oman. But once IFC (International 
                    Finance Corporation), a member of the World Bank Group got 
                    involved both as a lender and shareholder it opened the doors 
                    for international banks and export credit agencies (ECAs) 
                    from France and England. The phase 1 project cost was $230mn. 
                    In 2000, the government asked us to increase our capacity 
                    from 90MW to 270MW. Our project is based on BOOT (Build, Own, 
                    Operate and Transfer) for the plant and BOT (Build, Own and 
                    Transfer) for the transmission network. All other power projects 
                    that followed us were on BOO (Build, Own, Operate). If the 
                    phase II had not happened, we would have given back the project 
                    to the government in 2016, but now the life of the project 
                    has been extended by four years till 2020, after which the 
                    plant will be handed over to the government. Since the promulgation 
                    of the sector law and the strong commitment for privatisation, 
                    we would expect that the ‘T’ will no longer remain for power 
                    plant. As the machines have a lifespan beyond the PPA term, 
                    it would be logical to assume that the company will continue 
                    to produce power beyond 2020. Transmission lines, however, 
                    would be handed over to the government in 2016 as it would 
                    complete its 20 years PPA life.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    How have the recent changes in the electricity sector impacted 
                    your business?</b><br>
                    From a consumer point of view the sector is still under the 
                    relevant ministry. Through the unbundling process, the government’s 
                    control has been transferred to a number of private companies. 
                    This has brought in more independence and a private sector 
                    ethos to the sector. Earlier, our customer was the Ministry 
                    of Electricity and Water (now MHEW), but after the privatisation 
                    of the sector, Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) 
                    is our customer and all our contracts have been transferred 
                    to OPWP. <br>
                    <br>
                    The sector has become more organised. UPC is both a transmission 
                    and generation company, but because of the legal and other 
                    issues we were allowed to keep the transmission network and 
                    still not be in contravention of the power generation license. 
                    Pursuant to the sector law, the intention of the government 
                    is to take back the transmission lines network earlier. We 
                    will continue to find acceptable solutions for transfer of 
                    transmission network and the removal of ‘T’ to enhance shareholders 
                    value.<br>

                    <b>Power companies in the Sultanate operate on a fixed price 
                    model? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this business 
                    model?</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="images/img23.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5" width="200" height="290"> 
                    Looking at the weather pattern in the Middle East, this is 
                    the only workable model, because there is a peak demand during 
                    summers and a reduced demand in winters. If it was a completely 
                    commercial model based on demand and supply, it would be difficult 
                    to justify running a plant at full load only during summers. 
                    As per the model, we have to demonstrate that the plant has 
                    the capability (and availability)and we get paid accordingly. 
                    If this was not the case then it would be difficult to get 
                    power companies to come to Oman. In the West, the concept 
                    of merchant plant exists. For example, in the US, anyone can 
                    set up a captive power plant and start selling to any buyer 
                    which could be an individual, government or industry. There 
                    are also transmission companies whose sole focus is to connect 
                    the captive power plant with customers and they can fix their 
                    price based on market forces, then there are individual companies 
                    who just provide fuel to the individual power producers. Right 
                    now, I cannot visualise this happening in this part of the 
                    world. For IPP’s there are no upside /rewards but at the same 
                    time there are no significant risks as well. From the ministry’s 
                    point of view the government is also not exposed to unforeseen 
                    risks as through the PPA it knows what it has to pay over 
                    the term of the PPA. Had it been a merchant type of IPP here, 
                    both IPPs and the ministry would be exposed to risks and if 
                    subsidy did not exist, then the individual consumer would 
                    be directly affected.<br>

                    <b>Are there any plans to put up mega power plants to negotiate 
                    the power issue?</b><br>
                    The next big projects that are in the market are Sohar II 
                    and Barka III. The government has a well defined plan to take 
                    care of the future demand and they have been up to speed on 
                    that. On a broader level there are plans to integrate Oman 
                    and GCC grids. This will help in the exchange of surplus power 
                    between the GCC countries.<br>

                    <b>The Authority for Electricity Regulation (AER) has come 
                    out with an exhaustive report on renewable energy and there 
                    has been a lot of interest in alternative energy. How viable 
                    are such prospects? </b><br>
                    Solar energy seems to be quite promising, wind energy is limited 
                    to certain specific areas. The Sultanate’s focus will be on 
                    solar but making it commercially viable is a struggle not 
                    just here but internationally. Nuclear power is a cheaper 
                    and efficient option. For example UAE is actively considering 
                    setting up a nuclear plant. The initial cost of setting up 
                    such a plant is quite high, but it is safer and more environment 
                    friendly. Coal is another option and there are talks about 
                    setting up a coal fired power plant in Duqm. Coal is not environment 
                    friendly, but it is a cheaper option. If there is a shortage 
                    of gas, then power plants may have to run on diesel oil. Diesel 
                    generated plants are neither cost effective nor environment 
                    friendly. So overall, coal and solar are the likely frontiers 
                    <br>

                    thanks to the joint efforts of the Embassy of Netherlands

                    Rembrandt once said, “Without atmosphere a painting is nothing.” 
                    Grand Hyatt, Muscat is all set to give you the right atmosphere 
                    to feel and see Rembrandts marvellous etchings. Rembrandt’s 
                    original etchings are now in Oman and for the very first time 
                    in Gulf. This has been made possible by the joint endeavours 
                    of the Embassy of Netherlands and Al Salmi library. The exhibition 
                    had its grand opening on August 19, 2009 and the event was 
                    graced by His Highness Sayyid Haitham Bin Tariq Al Said. The 
                    Afrah ballroom has been transformed into a Dutch house with 
                    a massive doorway similar to that of Rembrandt House Museum 
                    in Amsterdam. This is an effort to make the atmosphere suitable 
                    for the paintings as this is what Rembrandt believed in. <br>
                    <br>
                    Mayank Singh speaks to Abdullah bin Salem Al Salmi from Al 
                    Salmi Library about the show. Excerpts.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Al Salmi Library has been in the news for its efforts in 
                    bringing the Rembrandt etchings to Oman. Can you tell us something 
                    about the library? </b><br>
                    Al Salmi library is one of the oldest libraries in Oman, and 
                    was established by our grandfather Nooruddin Salmi in 1898, 
                    who was a scholar and historian. The library has four sections 
                    – documents, manuscripts, books and references with around 
                    6,000 titles and a small museum. The library is a part of 
                    the Nooruddin Salmi school which is in Bidiya.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How did the idea of doing this exhibition materialise? 
                    </b> <br>
                    Our society seems to be too dependent on the government to 
                    initiate everything and there is a need for the community 
                    to come up with new initiatives and ideas. This was where 
                    the idea germinated. Secondly, we believe that we need to 
                    interact with other cultures to understand each other, this 
                    will ease misunderstanding and mistrust. An exchange of art, 
                    knowledge, ideas and even religion can bring about more coherence 
                    between cultures. Keeping this in mind we started communication 
                    with Rembrandt House. While they were happy about the proposal, 
                    they were initially a bit hesitant about 100 original etchings 
                    going to the Middle East. But once they visited Oman they 
                    became confident about the security of the paintings and other 
                    issues.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What were the concerns that needed to be addressed for 
                    such an event and what kind of a response are you expecting?</b><br>
                    Executives from the Rembrandt House came here and visited 
                    the venue, they checked the humidity and temperature levels 
                    and the handling of the paintings. They were reassured that 
                    there are companies and institutions that were capable of 
                    handling such high value paintings.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition we have insured the etchings for a big sum of 
                    money as a precautionary measure. The paintings will be accompanied 
                    by people from Rembrandt House during the duration of the 
                    exhibition to ensure that they are in good condition. We tried 
                    to select etchings that have some relevance to Eastern society 
                    and culture. There is a lot of enthusiasm about the event 
                    and we expect expats from the GCC to visit Oman to have a 
                    look at these etchings. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Who are the other key partners involved with the effort 
                    apart from Al Salmi Library and what kind of expenses are 
                    expected? </b><br>
                    The Al Salmi Library is organising the whole exhibition and 
                    is footing the entire cost. We have received a lot of support 
                    from the Netherland’s Embassy and Rembrandt House, the government 
                    too has supported us. Overall, we are spending anywhere between 
                    RO300,000 to RO350,000 on the effort. <br>

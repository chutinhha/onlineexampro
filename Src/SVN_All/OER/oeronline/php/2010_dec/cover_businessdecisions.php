                the Oman government to upgrade the country’s two main airports – 
                Muscat and Salalah – in a bid to cater to the burgeoning air 
                traffic in the country. The upgradation works for the two 
                airports are besides the five new airports at Sohar, Ras Al Hadd, 
                Duqm, Adam and Shaleem.<br>
                <br>
                The much-awaited RO294mn-Salalah airport expansion project was 
                bagged by a consortium led by India’s engineering conglomerate 
                Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T). The local partner in the consortium is 
                Galfar Engineering and Contracting Company.<br>
                <br>
                The scope of work for Salalah airport include design and 
                building of a new terminal, a 4 km-long runway, air traffic 
                control tower, new fuel farm and fuel network, new rescue and 
                fire fighting station, new aircraft parking hangar, air side 
                works and other facilities. The airport will be able to handle 
                one million passengers per year after the expansion. This can be 
                scaled up to two million. The RO706mn contract for building the 
                Muscat airport passenger terminal building was bagged by a 
                consortium of US-based Bechtel, Bahwan Engineering Company and 
                Turkey’s INCA.<br>
                <br>
                The airport terminal, which will be completed within 38 months, 
                will be designed to handle 12 million passengers annually. The 
                airport is designed in such a way to scale up the terminal 
                passenger handling capacity to 24 million at a later stage.<br>
                <br>
                The Muscat International Airport, which is designed to 
                accommodate large Airbus 380 planes, will have 29 aircraft 
                contact stands and 10 to 30 remote parking stands, depending on 
                phasing options. Once operational, the airport will also have 60 
                departure check-in counters for economy class and another 24 
                counters for passengers of other class, which is in addition to 
                several kiosks for easy check-in. The departure section will 
                also have 29 boarding gates for different destinations, and

                Oman’s banking regulatory authority, The Central Bank of Oman (CBO), 
                gave the nod for setting up Al Izz International Bank, a

                Oman, Bank Dhofar, Bank Sohar, Oman International Bank, Oman 
                Arab Bank and Ahlibank. The decision, to give the green signal 
                to new bank was taken at a meeting of the CBO Board of 
                Governors, which met under the chairmanship of Dr Ali Bin

                Al Izz International Bank plans to launch an initial public 
                offering (IPO) in the third-quarter of 2011. The new financial 
                institution will have a capital of RO100mn and expects to begin 
                operations after an IPO issue, which will raise 40 per cent of 
                the capital while the rest will come from the promoters of the 
                bank. The minimum capital required for a new bank, as per CBO 
                regulations, is RO100mn, while the minimum capital requirement 
                of new branches of foreign banks is RO20mn. Meanwhile, a second 
                proposal for establishing yet another bank, the Nizwa Bank is 
                awaiting the nod from CBO.<br>

                <br>
                Following closely on the heels of a royal directive to plant one 
                million date palms in 2009, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, 
                issued a fresh order to grow 100,000 coconut trees in the 
                southern Dhofar governorate.<br>
                <br>
                The Royal Orders to plant the coconut trees come within the 
                framework of the Royal attention of His Majesty to the 
                agricultural sector in the Sultanate and care for it all over 
                the country, stated Sayyid Ali bin Hamoud Al Busaidi, minister 
                of the Diwan of Royal Court. Shaikh Salim bin Hilal al Khalili, 
                Minister of Agriculture, also expressed his gratitude for the 
                Royal grant issued by His Majesty to plant the 100,000 coconut 
                trees. The Royal orders embody His Majesty’s wisdom and 
                farsighted vision to develop the agriculture sector and benefit 
                from the Sultanate’s climatic diversity. The aim is to reach a 
                balanced agricultural development that covers all regions of the 
                Sultanate and is a means of achieving food security for the 
                people of Oman. A landmark symposium on ‘Sustainable development 
                of agricultural sector’ was held in 2009 at the Royal Camp at 
                Saih Al Masarat in Ibri to discuss agricultural issues. During 
                this visit, His Majesty the Sultan issued Royal Directives to 
                plant one million date palm trees in view of the fact that these 
                trees had been the backbone of food security in Oman alongside 
                other plantations, animal wealth and fisheries, which are among 
                the great wealth resources for the country.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                Nawras, which broke the monopoly of state-controlled Omantel in 
                2006, put up 260 million shares priced between 702 to 902 baisas 
                in Oman’s first IPO sale through a book building process. Nawras, 
                is now trading on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) under the 
                ticker symbol, ‘nwrs’.<br>
                <br>
                Following the IPO, 40 per cent of the shares are in free float 
                with the Qtel subsidiary retaining 55 per cent of the company 
                and 5 per cent held by the original Omani pension funds. Nawras

                Retail and institutional investors were be able to participate 
                in the offering, which was the first IPO of 2010 in Oman and the 
                first since the Sohar Power Company IPO in July 2008. The Nawras 
                IPO, raised a total of RO182mn. Based on the listing price of 
                702 bzs the initial market capitalisation of Nawras was RO456mn,

                Housing, the census is the main information database from which 
                development plans in the Sultanate emerge. The census serves the 
                economic, social, health and educational aspects to mention only 
                a few in the light of the insights it provides on population, 
                houses, and establishments as well as the various other 
                characteristics.<br>
                <br>
                In this regard the 2010 Census of Population, Housing, and 
                Establishments will be the best assistance to realise the above 
                mentioned objectives. Knowing the size of the population in any

                Disaggregated and quality data for the population size,

                The demand for electricity in the Sultanate of Oman is expected 
                to increase at a rate of around eight per cent a year due to its 
                expanding economy in the next five to 10 years. The demand is 
                being fuelled by not only population growth but also by huge 
                investments in tourism, industrial and real estate projects. <br>
                <br>
                Projections made by Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP), 
                which oversees procurement of new power and related water 
                capacity, envisions a requirement of between 2,900 MW and 4,100 
                MW of additional power generation resources within the Main 
                Interconnected System (MIS) of Oman. An estimated half a million 
                customers are served by the MIS, in areas encompassing the 
                Governorates of Muscat and Buraimi, most of South Batinah, 
                Dakhiliyah, Sharqiyah, North Batinah and Dhahirah regions.<br>
                <br>
                The aggressive development of the power sector is being marked 
                by investments in truly world-scale greenfield power generation 
                projects. OPWP awarded mandates to a consortium led by France’s 
                GDF Suez Group for the development of a pair of Independent

                A 35-km long bridge connecting Masirah island to the mainland 
                has been envisaged by the ministry of finance, under the royal 
                directive of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Once it is 
                ready in 2013, the Masirah bridge will boost trade and tourism 
                to the isle. <br>
                <br>
                The Masirah Island, located off the southeast coast of Oman in 
                the  Arabian Sea, has a base of Royal Oman Air Force, is 
                sparsely populated, and would have remained a recluse had it not 
                been for the government which undertook a drive to popularise 
                the tourist attractions of the island, namely the turtle nesting 
                areas as well as other flora and fauna. But the only way for 
                citizens and tourists to and from the island was an hour long 
                ride in the  ferry boat which used to be rendered useless during 
                natural calamities like cyclones.<br>
                <br>
                Masirah has a population of around 12,000, about 20 per cent of 
                them are expatriates employed by the air force and civil work 
                contractors, according to Manpower Ministry statistics.<br>
                <br>
                Despite having white sandy beaches, clear water for snorkelling 
                and being home to rare turtles, the number of tourists visiting 
                the island is about two to three thousand a year, out of a 
                million tourists Oman receives a year. All that will change once

				<font face="Verdana" size="1">His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said approved a 20-point 
                recommendation mooted by the Traffic Safety Symposium (TSS) held 
                under the theme ‘Yes to Limiting Traffic Accidents’ with an 
                order for immediately implementing them.<br>
                <br>
                Lt Gen Malik bin Sulaiman al Maamari, Inspector General of 
                Police and Customs, affirmed that all respective government 
                departments will implement these recommendations and soon there 
                will be a number of procedures to activate them. Among the new 
                initiatives, October 18 was agreed upon as annual Traffic Safety 
                Day. Additionally, the setting up of a national centre for road 
                traffic statistics and information were agreed upon.<br>
                <br>
                The 20 recommendations made by the Traffic Safety Symposium came 
                after five days of brainstorming sessions in which national and 
                international experts participated to find solutions to limit 
                traffic accidents in the Sultanate. The 20-point strategy is to 
                fight the scourge bedeviling the country in the form of alarming 
                number of road accidents, maiming and killing citizens. His 
                Majesty had last year termed road accidents as a tax on the 
                public.<br>
                <br>
                The National Committee for Road Safety, the apex body for 
                overseeing the 10-year plan from 2011 to 2020, has an onerous 
                task on its head in setting targets, prioritising focus areas 
                and orchestrating harmonious functioning of all departments and 
                organisations, both governmental and non-governmental.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                Over 300 delegates, including around 60 senior Omani government 
                and business executives, attended the Oman Trade &amp; Investment 
                Forum which was held at London’s prestigious Mansion House on 
                the occasion of the 40th National Day of Oman. The Omani 
                delegation was led by HE Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, Minister of 
                Commerce and Industry and Chairman of OCIPED, and included HE 
                Khalil Abdullah al Khonji, Chairman of Oman Chamber of Commerce 
                and Industry (OCCI), and Dr Salem ben Nasser al Ismaily, CEO, 
                OCIPED.<br>

                UK has the largest number of investments in the Sultanate of 
                Oman and it was only imperative that more British private sector 
                investment in the country takes place to sustain the strategic 
                relationship between the two countries. The UK is a strong 
                trading partner for Oman with bilateral trade being worth over 
                £450m last year . In the first Quarter of 2010 exports had 
                increased by a further 40 per cent.<br>
                <br>
                HE Maqbool encouraged British companies to look at Oman as a 
                strategic location using it as a hub for trade with other Middle 
                Eastern countries, East Africa and further afield, benefiting 
                from Oman’s political and economic stability, its excellent 
                relations with neighbouring countries and its friendly and 
                flexible laws which welcome foreign investments. The forum 
                examined business opportunities for partnership in key areas 
                including project finance; financial and legal services; power, 
                water and renewable energy; Salalah and Sohar Free Trade Zones; 
                education and skills development; and tourism and hospitality. 
                The forum also provided a framework to discuss partnership 
                opportunities between Oman and the UK, building on the existing 
                strong bilateral relations and to establish new business ties to 
                raise the profile of  Oman in the UK.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                The establishment of The Public Authority for Radio and 
                Television by Royal Decree No 108/2010 in October is a major 
                landmark for the media sector in Oman. The authority will have 
                its juristic personality, public authorities, financial and 
                administrative independence.<br>
                <br>
                The Authority, according to the royal decree, shall have the 
                authority to manage its funds and take actions towards them. It 
                shall be under the supervision of the Information Minister and 
                shall carry out its activities as per the commercial rules.<br>
                <br>
                The Authority shall be based in Muscat Governorate and it may 
                establish branches inside the Sultanate and foreign offices as 
                well, as per the dictates of public interest and according to a 
                decision by its board of directors. The royal decree will give a 
                boost to the broadcasting sector, as it is expected to come out 
                with more programmes on education, science, sports, light 
                entertainment and general knowledge.<br>
                <br>
                The electronic and print media in the Sultanate have played a 
                pivotal role in reflecting the development and progress of the 
                Sultanate. During the year, the first privately owned FM station 
                in the Sultanate heralded a new era in broadcasting, bringing to 
                an end more than three decades of dominance by the state-owned 
                electronic media. Hala 102.7 FM, the first privately owned FM 
                station in the Sultanate, was pioneered by the OHI Group, a 
                leading Omani business house. Sabco Media launched its Al Wisal 
                Arabic FM radio channel, with the motto ‘talk less, play more 
                (music)’. </font><hr color="#000000" size="1"></td>

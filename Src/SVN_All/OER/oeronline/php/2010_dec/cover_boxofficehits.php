                Toy Story 3 was released worldwide from June through October in 
                Disney Digital 3D, RealD and IMAX 3D. The feature broke the 
                record of Shrek the Third as the biggest opening day North 
                American gross for an animated film. The film was produced by 
                Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. 
                Toy Story 3 was also the first of only two films to be released 
                theatrically with 7.1 surround sound, the second being Step Up 
                3D. In early August, the film became Pixar’s highest-grossing 
                film worldwide and surpassed Shrek 2 as the highest-grossing 
                animated film of all-time worldwide; in late August, Toy Story 3 
                became the first ever Pixar film and animated film in history to 
                make over $1bn worldwide. It is currently the fifth

                Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film featuring the 
                Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and 
                distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is the sequel to 2008’s 
                Iron Man, the second film in a planned trilogy and is a part of 
                the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Jon Favreau, the film 
                stars Robert Downey Jr, who reprises his role as Tony Stark. In 
                cinematic canon, it takes place six months after Iron Man, and 
                directly before The Incredible Hulk. In the movie Stark reveals 
                his identity as Iron Man and resists calls by the US government 
                to hand over the technology. Ivan Vanko duplicates the 
                technology and builds weapons of his own, creating new 
                challenges for Stark.</font><hr color="#CC3300" size="1">

                Based on the 1865 fantasy novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland 
                by Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland is an American fantasy 
                adventure film in which Mia Wasikowska plays 19-year-old Alice, 
                who returns to ‘Underland’, after her first to the place 13 
                years ago. She is told that she is the only one who can slay the 
                Jabberwocky, a dragon-like creature controlled by the Red Queen 
                who terrorises Underland’s inhabitants. The film uses a 
                combination of live action and 3D animation in a story that can 
                neither be described as a sequel nor as a re-imagining. Tim 
                Burton developed the story because he never felt an emotional 
                connection to the original book, with its series of events about 
                a girl wandering from one weird character to another.<br>

                Shrek Forever After, taglined as Shrek: The Final Chapter, is an 
                animated fantasy-comedy film, and the fourth and final 
                installment in the Shrek film series. The film was released by 
                DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures. 
                Although the film received mixed to positive reviews from 
                critics and opened lower than expectations, it remained as the 
                No. 1 film in the US and Canada for three consecutive weeks. 
                Additionally, the film is DreamWorks Animation’s 
                highest-grossing film at the foreign box office. Like the first 
                three Shrek films, the film is based on fairy tale themes.</font><hr color="#CC3300" size="1">

                How to Train Your Dragon is a computer-animated fantasy film by 
                DreamWorks Animation. The movie is loosely based on the 2003 
                book of the same title. The story takes place in a mythical 
                Viking world where a young teenager named Hiccup aspires to 
                follow his tribe’s tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After 
                finally capturing his first dragon, and posed with a chance to 
                finally gain the tribe’s acceptance, he finds that he no longer 
                has the desire to kill it and instead befriends it. The film 
                overcame a disappointing opening weekend at the box office to 
                gross just under half a billion dollars and become DreamWorks 
                Animation’s fifth most successful film in the US and Canada 
                (behind the Shrek film series).<br>

					completed 35 years in Oman. Can you give us an account of 
					the initial years and the progress of the brand in the last 
					three decades </b><br>
					<br>
					We started TOO on February 23, 1975 as I felt that the 
					country needed a newspaper in English. In those days there 
					was no radio, television station or newspaper in English, so 
					this became a limitation in showcasing the country to 
					outsiders as there was no one was there to speak on your 
					behalf. It was difficult to set up the first English 
					newspaper but since I owned a printing press – the Oriental 
					Printing Press, it was relatively easier for us to overcome 
					the teething problems. TOO started out as a weekly tabloid 
					with only 16 pages. The biggest challenge was to get editors 
					and reporters who were proficient with English as there were 
					no English speaking Omani journalists. As a result we had to 
					get expatriate journalists from India, Philippines or 
					Pakistan.<br>
					<br>
					The idea for the newspaper came when I was working for the 
					Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). I joined the MFA on 
					February 22, 1972 as director of five departments – finance, 
					administration, consular, protocol, security and 
					coordination – as in those days there were few educated 
					Omanis. The MFA had a staff strength of 16 people and all my 
					colleagues were looking after two-to-three departments. One 
					April 1, 1974 I received a telex from a Chicago, US based 
					company called Flying Tires. Its Singapore office had sent 
					in a request seeking permission for a fly over. The telex 
					was addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muscat, 
					Sultanate of Oman, Saudi Arabia. I lost my temper on seeing 
					the telex and wanted to destroy it, but I kept my cool. I 
					kept seething for three days on the thought of an 
					independent country like Oman being mentioned as Saudi 
					Arabia. After three days I realised that Oman had few 
					consulate offices abroad and there were no English 
					newspaper, television or radio stations to educate people 
					abroad. I gave the company permission for the fly over with 
					a warning to address their future correspondence correctly 
					to the Sultanate of Oman. Simultaneously, I decided that we 
					needed to start an English newspaper to educate people about 
					the count<br>
					<br>
					<b>TOO has been a leader in the English newspaper category 
					for decades, what accounts for its success?</b><br>
					Our readers have been our biggest strength. They have 
					appreciated our editorial content, layouts and design. We 
					give both local and international news. Around 65 per cent 
					of our readers are Indians and we take care to provide them 
					with relevant news. I am happy with what we have achieved, 
					but we have more visions. We need to constantly improve the 
					newspaper to provide more value to our readers and that 
					requires constant effort from our side.<br>

					a business driven environment, how has the newspaper 
					maintained a balance between editorial content and marketing 
					pressures?<br>
					We have separate editorial and marketing teams. In addition 
					there are advisors. These teams function independently but 
					also coordinate with each other. There is harmony and 
					coordination between our various departments which helps in 
					striking the right balance. Secondly, we depend on reputed 
					news agencies for news which helps us to maintain 
					impartiality.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How has the media business changed over these 35 years?<br>
					</b>Things have changed drastically over the years. The 
					industry has matured and progressed. For example, people 
					have started reading newspapers in an electronic form. And 
					we too have moved in this direction. Muscat Press and 
					Publishing House (MPPH) has its own in-house IT development 
					team, which takes care of all our IT related developments. 
					We have launched first-of-its-kind products in the Middle 
					East, starting from WAP services, e-mobile newspapers that 
					enables readers to see the entire newspaper on their mobile 
					phone. TOO and Al Shabiba both are available as e-mobile 
					newspapers. We have mobile services which provides 
					entertainment content – except for mobile operators, no one 
					has this service in Oman. We have launched an electronic 
					newspaper where you can see the entire newspaper as a soft 
					copy. MPPH is the first media house in the Sultanate to tie 
					up with newspaper direct – the digital worldwide network. 
					The tie-up makes TOO and Al Shabiba available across the 
					world in all Intercontinental hotels. We have launched i-phone 
					applications, another first in the Middle East. On the 
					marketing side clients can book a classified ad in our 
					publications using a mobile phone. People staying in the 
					interiors like Ibri, Sohar, Salalah (and Muscat too) etc can 
					book a classified advertisement in our newspapers by just 
					sending us a message the ad gets published in the next day’s 
					newspaper. <br>
					<br>
					<b>You have been the Editor-in-Chief of Times of Oman since 
					its inception. Can you give us details of your achievements 
					and what is your message for young journalists?<br>
					</b>Starting with one newspaper we have grown the number of 
					titles that we have over the years. Today we have TOO, Al 
					Shabiba – an Arabic newspaper, Thursday – a weekly magazine, 
					Hi! a weekly newspaper which comes every Friday; Al Youm Al 
					Sabe, Black and White a fortnightly magazine and Faces. 
					Overall, we have a 65 per cent market share in Oman. We are 
					proud of our newspaper, our achievements and our work. We 
					have a strong editorial, marketing and IT department. 
					Starting with 13 people in 1975, we now have a staff 
					strength of 300. We have two printing presses, out of which 
					one remains on standby for any contingency. For every ten 
					rials that we earn we spend nine rials on developing our 
					people, as they are our key asset. <br>
					<br>
					My advice to young journalists is that they should devote 
					themselves to studying journalism in English. Since the 
					Sultan Qaboos University does not offer journalism courses 
					in English, I would suggest the private sector to establish 
					a college or University for English journalism. This will 
					encourage Omani journalists to get educated and trained in 
					English journalism. The industry today, faces a shortage of 
					Omani English journalists and as we go ahead we need more 
					Omani journalists.<br>

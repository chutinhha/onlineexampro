                <br>
                T</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">here was once a time 
				when the world financial markets caught pneumonia whenever Wall 
				Street sneezed. No more. Shanghai has now arguably replaced 
				downtown Manhattan as the epicentre of global equities angst. 
				The People’s Bank of China (PBOC)’s move to tighten yuan money 
				market rates and a 50 basis point rise in the bank reserve ratio 
				(RRR) led to falls in Asian equity indices, commodity currencies 
				like the Brazilian real and Australian dollar, the price of 
				copper and crude, Latin American and GCC sovereign debts. 
				Nothing dramatic but the message from the markets is all too 
				ominous. The global bull market is hostage to policy shifts 
				decreed by the mandarins of Middle Kingdom’s central bank.<br>
				<br>
				<b>EXTREMIST LENDING<br>
				</b>The Chinese flooded their financial markets with 9trn yuan 
				in modern history’s most extreme example of state directed bank 
				lending to combat the post-Lehman risk of deflation. Even as 
				Chinese exports collapsed and 40 million workers lost their jobs 
				in the coastal provinces, the Shanghai A share index and 
				property prices surged on an epic scale.<br>
				<br>
				Even Premier Wen Jiabao complained that the Chinese economy was 
				overheated and raised property taxes, stamp duty and mortgage 
				rates to restrict speculative lending. Yet the PBOC cannot risk 
				a significant monetary tightening as long as their export growth 
				is anemic and inflation does not accelerate. Chinese bank loan 
				growth will moderate and the PBOC will raise the cash reserve 
				ratio again but successive rate hikes will not derail the 9-10 
				per cent GDP growth momentum. In China, only a monetary 
				sledgehammer (high real interest rates, loan quotas, credit 
				rationing) kills bull runs in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock 
				exchanges.<br>
				<br>
				<b>GALLOPING ECONOMY<br>
				</b>Chinese is the world’s fastest growing major economy. 
				Earnings growth will surge in Chinese consumer banks, insurance, 
				media and telecom shares, thanks to a nine per cent GDP growth, 
				the government stimulus and the emergence of a new middle class. 
				Retail sales and car sales in China have surged. It is entirely 
				rational to expect a 25-30 per cent EPS growth for Chinese 
				companies in the MSCI China index yet MSCI China trades at a 
				modest valuation of 15 times earnings. These are hardly bubble 
				metrics.<br>
				<br>
				Aggressive central bank tightening is as low risk a probability 
				in China as a double dip recession unless inflation goes 
				ballistic. Yet rice and pork are such a high component of the 
				Chinese CPI that the government hoards grain reserves to keep 
				food prices stable and the mandate of heaven clearly is in the 
				close grip of the Communist Party.<br>
				<br>
				<b>SAFE BETS<br>
				</b>My favourite Chinese blue chip bets for 2010? CNOOC, the 
				Chinese oil major whose takeover bid for Unocal provoked 
				Congressional outrage and a Washington engineered white knight 
				deal with Chevron. CNOOC profits will surge due to aggressive 
				upstream deals in West Africa and Kazakhstan, rising output and 
				new projects. China Life, China Telecom, ICBC, Focus Media and 
				the Bank of China are pure proxies for the growth of the Chinese 
				economy and consumer. Retail investor in the Gulf could well buy 
				the Footsie Xinhua index, which trades as a listed country index 
				fund in New York under the symbol FXI. The PBOC move could 
				trigger a 10 per cent correction in Chinese equities as major 
				bank shares in the index fall. I believe a 30 per cent rise in 
				the dollar Chinese index fund FXI is entirely rational as 
				emerging markets money managers are now underweighting China.<br>
				<br>
				<b>ROAR OF DRAGON<br>
				</b>What could derail the bull momentum in Chinese equities? A 
				policy mistake by the Federal Reserve could trigger a global 
				risk aversion scenario and hit emerging markets shares with a 
				vengeance. The IMF estimates bank write offs will exceed $3-4bn. 
				Ethnic secessionism in Tibet and Sinkiang could provoke 
				political risks. Sovereign debt risk could escalate with a new 
				Iceland/ Dubai/ Latvia style debt shock. While the Chinese 
				dragon is set to roar in the Year of the Tiger, the world’s 
				pneumonia could well make Shanghai sneeze on occasions.<br>
				<br>
				<b>SENSEX CORRECTION<br>
				</b>I believe Dalal Street’s bull run since March 2009 is now 
				living on borrowed time. I believe Indian money market rates 
				will rise by 300 basis points in the next six months. Of course, 
				it is entirely possible that Sensex companies will deliver 15-18 
				per cent earnings growth. So I believe a bear market is not on 
				the horizon. Yet a 2000- 3000 point correction on Indian shares 
				is entirely possible. This was the lesson of October 2005, when 
				the RBI last began a tightening cycle.<br>
				<br>
				<b>CHEAP EQUITIES<br>
				</b>It is significant that GCC/ Arab shares have underperformed 
				on the broader emerging markets indices due to the Dubai World 
				debt shocks, higher borrowing risk premium in the capital 
				markets and credit rating downgrades across the region. Yet Arab 
				equities are now cheap, at a 10 per cent discount to the Morgan 
				Stanley emerging market index. I would buy Saudi, Qatari and 
				Omani shares but avoid UAE and Kuwait, where banking and 
				property shares will post major losses in 2010. </font>

				<font face="Verdana" size="1">Omantel, the country’s largest 
				company listed on the Muscat Securities Market, officially 
				launched its new enhanced brand and a new tagline, “Together”, 
				capping the past year in which Omantel and its subsidiary Oman 
				Mobile had announced a merger and restructuring.<br>
				<br>
				The new visual identity unveiled by Dr Amer al Rawas, CEO, 
				Omantel, signals the entry into a new era. Speaking at a press 
				conference to announce the changes, Rawas said: “This is an 
				important step in the transformation of our business as the 
				enhanced brand has been defined to reflect our new vision, 
				mission and values for the corporation and to form the source of 
				inspiration for our future communication.”<br>
				<br>
				“Our new tagline also reflects our philosophy of togetherness as 
				this is at the heart of everything we do – as we lead the way in 
				bringing individuals, families, businesses and communities 
				together using leading edge technologies,” he said.<br>
				<br>
				Continuing further, Rawas says, “The new look of the brand has 
				been created to illustrate our new operating model visually. We 
				have stayed true to the Omantel logo, which embodies the Omani 
				heritage, in the form of the Khanjar, and have blended it with 
				the orange in the Oman Mobile logo to signify the vibrant and 
				progressive spirit of the group.”<br>
				<br>
				The Omantel name, combined both in Arabic and English, is now 
				cradled and encapsulated in our new brand symbol reflecting one 
				of our values; caring. The company will now embark on a phased 
				plan to rebrand our business and operations. This will start 
				with the launch of an integrated Omantel website for fixed, 
				mobile and internet in the coming few days, rebranding of its 
				buildings in the coming few months and subsequently a revamp of 
				all their retail stores. </font>

						As parts of its new slogan “together”, Omantel 
						ann-ounced changes to its Hayyak pre-paid service to 
						deliver additional benefits to its customers. The most 
						notable among the changes is the introduction of lower 
						off-peak rates for its hugely popular Hayyak prepaid 
						services from 45 to 39 baisa a minute and the 
						introduction of a new daily off-peak time starting from 
						8pm in the evening to 6am the following morning. The new 
						rates will also apply to Fridays and national holidays.<br>
						<br>
						In the past Hayyak off-peak rates started at 10pm until 
						10am but Omantel has now introduced the lower rates two 
						hours earlier to meet growing customer demand – 
						especially from young people and its expatriate customer 
						base. <br>
						<br>
						The new rate will make Oman’s most popular prepaid 
						service competitive during this time of the day and 
						represents a 13.3 per cent cut in the current off-peak 
						rates. Customers will be able to benefit immediately 
						from the new and better value pricing structure 
						following the approval of the change by the TRA.</font></td>

				<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				For Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), 2009 has been a successful 
				year on all counts. Production levels during 2009 have been 
				stable, new discoveries were made, and exciting EOR projects 
				neared completion. <br>
				<br>
				For the second year running, production of liquid hydrocarbons 
				(black oil, condensates and liquid petroleum gases) has risen. 
				Combined production of oil, condensate and LPG in 2009 stood at 
				641,000 barrels per day compared to 633,000 bpd in 2008 and 
				607,000 bpd in 2007.<br>
				<br>
				This improved performance was due to the continued increase in 
				condensate and LPG, valuable by-products of natural gas 
				production. Condensate and LPG production rose from 77,000 bpd 
				in 2008 to 89,000 bpd thanks largely to increased production 
				from the Kauther gas plant.<br>
				<br>
				“This is a record in the history of Oman’s gas industry – 
				indeed, there were times during 2009 when daily output of 
				condensate exceeded 100,000 barrels per day. Although small, LPG 
				production is important for Oman since it is used by most homes 
				as a cooking fuel. Last year, LPG production rose from 1,600 bpd 
				to 1,750 barrels per day. PDO is not the only LPG producer in 
				Oman – the nation’s refineries are also important sources of 
				this fuel,” said John Malcolm, managing director of PDO in his 
				annual media briefing.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Major oil and gas discoveries <br>
				</b>Oil and gas discoveries are extremely crucial for the 
				building of a sustainable future and 2009 has clearly signaled 
				that. During the year, PDO discovered three new oil fields, one 
				with a major volume of oil in place. The company has also found 
				a potentially large gas field, which is an extremely important 
				hydrocarbon resource to power the industrial sector in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				Following an ambitious exploration programme in Central Oman, 
				PDO has made a major oil discovery at Al Ghubar South, close to 
				the existing Al Ghubar and Qarn Alam fields.<br>
				<br>
				During 2009, four exploration and appraisal wells were drilled 
				in the field to confirm the discovery, and further drilling to 
				delineate further extensions of the field is planned during 
				2010. The amount of oil in place could be in excess of 1 billion 
				barrels making it a significant discovery.<br>
				<br>
				PDO has also made two further oil discoveries at Dafiq West in 
				the north of PDO’s concession area and Anbar in the central 
				region of the Sultanate. These four discoveries represent an 
				important success for PDO’s exploration efforts during 2009. 
				They highlight the continued hydrocarbons potential of Oman’s 
				subsurface and show the potential opportunities for further 
				exploration for many years to come.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ongoing projects on track <br>
				</b>As part of a drive towards the creation of a sustainable 
				future, the board of directors approved several major new 
				projects last year. In May, following a successful trial, PDO’s 
				board approved the full-scale development of the Amal East and 
				West fields in Central Oman using steam-based enhanced oil 
				recovery techniques. Amal will thus become the site of the 
				fourth field development project in the company’s EOR portfolio, 
				which currently consists of the polymer-injection project at 
				Marmul, the miscible-gas injection project at Harweel and the 
				steam-injection project at Qarn Alam.<br>
				<br>
				“The hard work of the last few years and the large number of new 
				and planned projects are all about one thing: securing oil and 
				gas production at a sustainable plateau. As you can see, in the 
				years to 2014 we expect to achieve this. Our oil production 
				target for the coming years remains at 540,000-560,000 bpd. Our 
				gas production – and with it condensate and LPG – is set to 
				continue rising, providing a solid base for Oman’s industrial 
				development over the next few years. Beyond this horizon, I 
				would expect oil production to remain stable,” says Malcolm.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Till the year 2002, the common complaint of market analysts was that 
Foreign Direct Investment in Oman will only grow if it’s allowed to happen. The 
corollary was that things could be a lot better if only so many sectors were not 
‘off limits’ to FDI. Over the last five years, there has been a quantum change 
in this scenario. What has brought about this change – and what more needs to be 
done? Abhijit Sinha reports… </b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">The World Bank ‘Doing Business’ report puts Oman 55th among 175 countries in 
regard to flexibility and ease in doing business, and the 2nd Arab Business 
Intelligence report ranks Oman 3rd amongst 22 Arab nations that inspire most 
economic confidence. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in a country is a 
reflection of that confidence – that is, building a long-term relationship 
between two commercial enterprises of two different nations. <br>
<br>
Now, with the Oman-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) scheduled to come into force by 
July, the confidence level of foreign investors is bound to go up. The long 
drawn out process of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) FTA with the European 
Union (EU) is now entering its final phase, and is likely to be in place by the 
end of 2007. With GCC FTAs with India, Pakistan, Japan and Singapore on the 
anvil, the region – and especially Oman -- will definitely see more FDI coming 
in.<br>
<br>
FDI has come to be regarded as a means to achieve economic development in its 
own right, with expected positive spillovers over and above those associated 
with domestically financed investments. Industrial monitors say that Oman has 
had the munificence of attracting 37 FDI projects worth US$ 837.70 million in 
2006, and four projects worth US$ 700 million have been logged in 
January-February 2007.<br>
<br>
H.E. Maqbool Sultan, minister for commerce and industry, told OER: “In 2006, the 
foreign investment Oman totaled US$ 2.7 billion (approx R.O. 0.9 billion), while 
FDI was 41.8 per cent of the total investment – and this included 21 per cent 
for the commerce and industry sector.” This inflow of foreign capital has 
benefited the private sector, whose contribution during the 6th Five-Year plan 
grew by 8.5 per cent, more than the average annual rate of the added value.<br>
<br>
In keeping with His Majesty Sultan Qaboos’ Vision 2020, the emphasis is on 
privatisation programme and infrastructure -- and on strategic industries like 
gas, tourism and IT. A number of projects worth US$12 billion are underway in 
Sur and Sohar that include Oman Polypropylene, Polyethylene, an oil refinery, 
aluminium smelter, iron project and a methanol project. “Initial estimates of 
potential exports are around R.O. 970 million per annum,” said the minister of 
commerce and industry.<br>
<br>
On the volume of investment in infrastructure projects, H.E. Maqbool Sultan 
said, “As per the 7th Five-Year plan, this volume is expected to be more than 
R.O. 13 billion – and investment in major tourism projects like the Blue City 
and Ras Al Had is conservatively estimated to be more than R.O. 15 billion in 
the next 10 years.”</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>FDI in 12 industrial clusters</b><br>
Since 2002, the major multinationals investing in the top 90 projects in Oman 
have been from five countries -- India in 17 projects (23 per cent), UAE in 10 
(14 per cent), USA in 9 (12 per cent), and four each (5 per cent) from Qatar and 
Egypt respectively. Investors from various other countries total the remaining 
40 per cent FDI in 29 assorted projects. <br>
<br>
The top dollars have gone to Business and Financial Services -- 19 projects 
attracting 21 per cent of the FDI coming into Oman since 2002. Joint 2nd come 
Heavy Industries, and Property/Tourism/Leisure with 15 projects each, getting 17 
per cent foreign investment share respectively. Also hitting the double digit is 
the Chemicals/Plastics and Rubber industrial cluster, with 10 projects carving 
out 11 per cent of the FDI pie.<br>
<br>
The remaining eight of the dozen industrial clusters are Food/Beverages/Tobacco 
and ICT (7 projects each, with 8 per cent share respectively), Electronics and 
Light Industry (5 projects each, with 6 per cent share respectively), 
Logistics/Distribution and Consumer Products (2 projects each, with 2 per cent 
share respectively). Life sciences (2 projects) and Transport equipment (1 
project) make the rest 3 per cent of the FDI inflow over the past five years.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the key 13 business sections in the 90 monitored projects drawing FDI 
allocations since 2002 are:<br>
<br>
The volume of Omani non-oil &amp; gas exports rose form R.O.173.29 million in 1996 
to R.O.555.3 million in 2005, a 14 per cent average growth rate undoubtedly 
facilitated by the successful inflow of FDI in the key industrial clusters and 
business sections. As the official figures show, the FDI inflow were definitely 
a factor in helping to build 29 Omani products -- and export figures touched 
R.O.349 million in 2005.<br>
<br>
<b>Single Window Processing</b><br>
The impact of FDI depends on a multitude of factors, such as the level of 
technology used in domestic production in the host country, the level of 
education of the host country workforce, the level of financial sector and 
institutional development, etc. All these factors and more contribute to whether 
the host country in question can “absorb” and hence benefit from FDI.<br>
<br>
A transparent and well-regulated economic system makes the Sultanate one of the 
most liberal and attractive markets in the Arab world. To attract FDI, the 
Sultanate has created a single window for processing all transactions and 
implemented a system to link all governmental units. “This ensures smooth 
running for over 96 per cent of the transactions,” says H.E. Maqbool Sultan. <br>
<br>
Another key factor for foreign investors is the setting up of six industrial 
estates in different parts of the country. Sohar industrial area now has an area 
of 7 million square metres. Basic infrastructure projects at Buraimi industrial 
area, with an area of 4.5 million square metre, is almost complete. Expansion of 
Nizwa, Rusail industrial areas and the Information Technology Park, termed 
Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM), is also underway.<br>
<br>
FDI-linked development of the country’s infrastructure is on a fast-track – the 
5th largest container port in the world at Salalah, an industrial port at Sohar, 
excellent road and air links, and world-class telecommunication facilities. Mina 
Sultan Qaboos, Muscat, is a well-established port that is equipped to handle any 
kind of vessel efficiently. A passenger terminal and a duty free zone will 
extend the range of services provided to users of this port.<br>
<br>
Together with the new developments, the Government has also charted a plan to 
upgrade existing hubs, and identify and develop other locations along the long 
coastline of Oman. <br>
<br>
Key incentives consist of;<br>
• Upto 100 per cent ownership,<br>
• Soft loans with low interest rates and easy payback option,<br>
• Exemption from customs duty on import of plant and equipment,<br>
• Relief from customs duty on raw materials,<br>
• No personal income tax,<br>
• Corporate tax holiday up to 10 years,<br>
• Full repatriation of capital, net profit and royalties, and<br>
• Export credit insurance through the Export Guarantee and Financing Agency 
(EGCA)<br>
<br>
Increased financial sector liberalisation and
private participation are the most likely policies that can facilitate the 
development of financial sector. The theoretical underpinnings of the link 
between 
financial development and economic growth can include mobilising resources, 
diversifying risk,
improving corporate governance, reducing 
transaction and information costs, and promoting specialisation.</font></p>

    survey of FDI enterprises from 2002-2005.<br>
    <br>
    The FDI enterprises survey includes foreign portfolio investment (FPI)–a 
    threshold of less than 10 per cent of foreign equity ownership in any Omani 
    enterprise qualifies as FDI-and other foreign investment, which includes 
    foreign deposits, loans from banks abroad and short-term payables.<br>

    The data for FDI in the real estates sector was obtained from the Ministry 
    of Housing, Electricity and Water. It represents the value of properties 
    purchased by GCC individuals and companies. This year, the volume of 
    macro-foreign investment too is being surveyed by the Directorate General of

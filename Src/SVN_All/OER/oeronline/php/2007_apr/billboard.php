        The Arab Steel Summit 2007, organised by the Arab Steel Union in 
        collaboration with Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Sharq (east) 
        Sohar Co, was held at the Muscat Grand Hyatt Hotel. The two-day summit 
        shed light on iron and steel industry’s rapid growth, industrial 
        activity in the Sultanate, future projects in iron and steel, as well as 
        getting acquainted with advanced technologies in the steel industry. 
        Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Harthy, Minister of Transport and 
        Communications, who presided over the inaugural ceremony, said the 
        summit was of special importance to the Sultanate as it was the first of 
        its kind in the country. “Thus, Oman joins as a new member to the iron 
        and steel manufacturing Arab countries,” he said. Al Harthy said the 
        steel prices have doubled as per reports while raw iron shipping prices 
        have also risen by more than three-folds since 2003. Hence, he said, a 
        need was felt to find strategic status for investors in iron and steel 
        industries to acquire sufficient energy for setting up such industries 
        and then shipping them at competitive prices. The Sultanate has started 
        its march towards developing heavy industries five years ago, he said 
        adding that Oman has to develop basic infrastructure, such as the Sohar 
        port, to attract such industries.<br>

        further evaluated them through its specialised arbitration committee. 
        Finally, 400 students were selected who received training and

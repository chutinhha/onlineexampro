<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
</b>The Sultanate of Oman — flanked by the Straits of Hormuz in the north and 
the Arabian Sea in the east with the coastline stretching for 1,700-odd km — 
prides itself on being a richly bestowed country especially in terms of marine 
resources. Its grand seafaring tradition and trade with the outside world dating 
back thousands of years owe much to the existence of the distinctive port 
infrastructure dotting the coastline of the country. The ports of Salalah, 
Muscat and Sohar have all along been the hub of trading with Africa, Europe, 
Egypt, India, Far East and other parts of the globe and they continue to drive 
Oman’s economy towards greater heights even after hundreds of years of existence 
— an extraordinary success story of an equally extraordinary maritime tradition.
<br>
<br>
Today, the spectacular advance made by the government and the private players in 
putting into place a modern port structure is at the heart of Oman’s transition 
from a primarily oil-based economy to a diversified one. These ports have been 
the carriers of a comprehensive feeder network to Oman’s industries for inbound 
and outbound cargo movement. In essence, the milestones accomplished by the 
ports of Oman through the centuries present a microcosmic depiction of the 
country’s glorious strides towards progress and development. We take a look at 
the success stories of Oman’s ports that have heralded the country towards a new 
course.<br>
<br>
<b>Port Sultan Qaboos<br>
</b>With the dawn of Renaissance in 1970, a new wave of development activities 
patronised by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said started to blow across 
different sectors, such as economy, social welfare, health, education, 
communication and transportation. Oman’s port sector was one of them and its 
spectacular progress owes much to the continued support extended by His 
Majesty’s government. In fact, the onset of modern chapter in Oman’s maritime 
commerce and development began with HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said inaugurating the 
Mina Qaboos (now Port Sultan Qaboos) port in Muscat in 1974. It’s Oman’s one of 
the premier maritime gateways and also has strategic importance, not only for 
the Arabian Gulf but also the Indian sub-continent and markets in Africa and 
Europe. The port, managed by Port Services Corporation SAOG constituted in 1976, 
is equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure, skilled personnel and 
efficient container handling operations.<br>
<br>
Port Sultan Qaboos serves as the main commercial port of the Sultanate, whereas 
the two other ports of Sohar and Salalah are mainly transhipment hubs and 
industrial ports. During 1977–2005, the total imports handled by port were about 
39.5 million DWT, accounting for 46.4 per cent of the Sultanate’s total imports. 
On the other hand, the total exports were more than six million DWT, that is 34 
per cent of total exports. <br>
<br>
In the last decade, the port fully capable to accommodate containerised 
shipping, witnessed an overhaul in terms of infrastructure development and 
service enhancement. The slew of modernisation projects has catapulted it into a 
state-of-the-art port bustling with container handling activities ranging from 
containerised goods to cars and cruise ships. The port now acts as the backbone 
of the consumer market in the capital city of Muscat as well as its hinterlands, 
and is capable of handling 300,000 TEU per annum. In the years to come, it 
further plans to give a fillip to its container handling capacity in view of the 
growing volumes in imports and exports.<br>
<br>
<b>Port of Salalah<br>
</b>Created in 1998 out of Mina Raysut, a small fishing port in the southern 
region of Oman, the vision behind creating the port of Salalah was to build a 
world-class container terminal that would give a fillip to the economy, 
employment rate and tourism as well as to facilitate Oman to become a global 
trading hub. <br>
<br>
The Salalah Port project, a 70:30 joint venture between the government of Oman 
and the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group with its headquarters in Copenhagen, is the 
largest privatisation project in Oman. </font>

The port’s management rests with the Salalah Port Services Company SAOG, with 
the single largest holding of shares (30 per cent) lying with foreign owner A.P. 
Moller-Maersk, and 70 per cent owned by Omani companies, investors and 
government collectively. SPS has signed a management agreement with APM 
Terminals, under which the Dutch company operates the port with best practices 
learned from the more than 45 container ports it is involved in globally. The 
largest in the Sultanate, it is a deepwater port and can accommodate large 
vessels up to 16m draft. The government and the Salalah Port Services are making 
a combined investment of US$356 million to increase the port’s capacity to four 
million TEU per annum from the present 2.4 million TEU. The developments also 
include dredging the port to 18m water depth.<br>
<br>
After just a few years since its creation, the Port of Salalah, 18 km south of 
Salalah city, has developed into one of the world’s largest container terminals, 
so much so that today it is recognised as one of the world’s leading 
transhipment centres, catapulting Oman onto the global shipping map. It is 
counted among the handful of ports in the world capable of handling the largest 
container vessels and is even equipped to handle the next generation of vessels, 
such as Maersk Line’s so-called E-Class vessels that are 397 meters long and 56 
meters wide! According to Tiemen Meester, CEO of the Port of Salalah, the port 
falls in the genre of common-user multi-purpose, and is the main container 
transhipment terminal of the region. It also has facilities to handle bulk 
cargo, general and liquid cargoes, and it offers value-added services such as 
bunkering, container repairs, a container freight station, warehousing and ship 
repairs. The port currently has four berths along 1,236 metres of quay and the 
capacity of the container terminal stands at 2.5 million TEU per annum. The 
government and SPS are investing US$356 million to increase the handling 
capacity of the port up to 4.4 million TEU per annum with the construction of 
two new berths with 10 very large gantry cranes. The first berth, which is 520 
metre long and equipped with six of the world’s largest gantry cranes, will have 
18m water depth and will be inaugurated in April. The construction is handled by 
a joint venture between CCC and Hani Archirodon that has won a contract worth 
US$262 million to construct two additional berths. <br>
<br>
The strategic location of the port, at the centre of the Indian Ocean Rim of 
countries (the port is situated a mere six hours steaming from the east-west 
shipping lanes), along with natural deep water, gives it a competitive edge to 
reach out to its customer base, including the international container shipping 
community who use the port as their transit hub for cargo flows to the Gulf, 
Indian Subcontinent, Red Sea and African destinations.</font><div align="center">

<b>Port of Sohar<br>
</b>The modern Port of Sohar, an industrial port, situated 240 km northwest of 
Muscat, has added a new episode in the development of futuristic port facilities 
in Oman. Set up in 2002, the port, along with its container project, is one of 
the largest of its kind in the world. The management of the port is under the 
Sohar Industrial Port Company (SIPC), a 50-50 joint venture between the 
government of Oman and the Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The port is run 
according to highest international standards and it received the prestigious 
DIMA Award for Outstanding Port Management last year. To enhance container 
terminal capacity of the port, the Oman International Container Terminal (OICT), 
a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holding, Oman government and 
Netherlands-based Steinweg, has been set up that presently has a container 
handling capacity of 800,000 TEU per annum. Two other terminals handle general 
cargo, dry bulk (Steinweg) and liquid bulk (Oiltanking Odfjell).<br>
<br>
The development of the Sohar port project has been planned in three phases. 
While Phase 1 involved the construction of two main breakwaters, dredging of the 
port basin and the entrance channel, construction of the initial quay wall and 
the liquid bulk jetty happened during Phase 2. According to SIPC’s CEO Jan 
Meijer, the port is currently undergoing its third expansion, which will 
increase the container handling capacity to over 2.1 million TEU per annum. The 
completion of Phase 3 is scheduled until October 2008, Meijer says adding, the 
number of berths in the port will almost be doubled by it, from 12 to 22. The 
work is done by a consortium of the Dutch dredging company Van Oord, a joint 
venture of Six Contruct (Belgian) and Interbeton (Dutch). While the work has 
been commissioned by MOTC, Halcrow is the engineering consultant, and SIPC is 
involved as landlord and advisor to MOTC.<br>
<br>
Sohar’s USP lies in its geographical position — being at the central position in 
the booming triangle of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Muscat. Due to its strategic 
location just outside the Strait of Hormuz, which is a major traffic hub for oil 
and gas shipments, the Port of Sohar allows ships to avoid increased insurance 
premiums, making it an ideal logistics hub. <br>
<br>
<b>Integrated development model<br>
<img border="0" src="spot2.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>One 
of the exclusive features of the Port of Sohar is that its management is based 
on the business proposition of ‘landlord port’ so as to maximise the involvement 
of the private sector. As per the proposition, which has its counterparts in 
Rotterdam, Antwerp, New York, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Iran and India, land and 
waterfront infrastructure are leased to private companies and industrial 
production, cargo handling and other operations are undertaken by specialised 
companies as they can offer quality and competitive rates. This allows SIPC to 
focus on other important segments like issuing rules and regulations and 
establishing the framework for health, safety, environment, emergency and 
security.<br>
<br>
The Port of Sohar is one of the world’s larger port development projects, 
currently spread over 2000 hectares and involving investments exceeding US$12 
billion (for the period 2002-2008). Investments worth billions of dollars are 
still in the pipeline to develop additional port facilities, heavy industries 
and utilities. The industrial projects in the Sohar port industrial area, a 
green-field industrial complex, are clubbed as one of the largest in the Middle 
East region and would go a long way in achieving the long-term strategy to 
diversify Oman’s economy as per the Oman Vision 2020.<br>
<br>
Within a few years of its establishment, the industrial port of Sohar today is 
flooded with huge international investments in industries and infrastructure 
projects around it to the tune of billions of dollars. The industrial port has 
been feeding the regional economy in particular and the national economy in 
general, by supplying raw materials and commodities and carrying the finished 
goods to different markets of the world, from a number of petrochemical, 
logistic and metal industries that have cropped up around the port in recent 
times.<br>
A number of industrial units coming up in Sohar are gas based. The industries 
(see box) have been established in three clusters — petrochemical, logistics and 
metal industries — to ensure integrated production and marketing. The 
petrochemical cluster of Sohar port project consists of a refinery and 
production plants for aromatics, formaldehyde, methanol, polyethylene, 
polypropylene, urea etc, while the metal cluster includes a steel complex and 
aluminium production. The most important rationale behind this integrated 
development model is to ensure economies of scale by reducing the operating cost 
and optimum utilisation of infrastructure for industrial units, as opposed to 
creating infrastructure and logistics service for different industries 
separately. The industrial zone has also been equipped with local infrastructure 
facilities so that there is no dependence on sourcing them from other areas. <br>
<br>
Similarly, the Salalah Free Zone Company (SFZC), established by the government 
adjacent to Salalah port, is all set to offer a professional environment, access 
to Salalah seaport and international airport facilities, ample labour, banking 
outlets, property management and 24-hour security. The SFZ, currently being 
developed in multiple phases over an area of 2,000 hectares, will offer a mix of 
industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, distribution, R&amp;D and office 
facilities, retail outlets, resort, and residential space, after it’s fully 
operational. The Phase 1 will be spread over 200 hectares, providing logistics, 
freight forwarding and manufacturing facilities, including infrastructure 
facilities like roads, power, water, etc. <br>
<br>
The management of the SFZ, officially launched in 2005, rests with Salalah Free 
Zone Company SAOC, a government-owned body. The government has extended many 
incentives at the free zone, including 100 per cent foreign ownership of 
investment of projects, import duty exemption and exemption from income tax for 
30 years and from minimum capital limit. Octal Petrochemical has set up the 
first project in the free zone and has already started commercial production. 
Recently, SFZC signed an agreement with India-based company Dunes Oman to set up 
a 12-hectare manufacturing unit at Salalah Free Zone for the production of 
automobile brakes, and in March the foundation stone for the project was laid.<br>
<br>
<b>The way forward<br>
</b>In recent years, visits by tourist vessels/cruise liners at the Port Sultan 
Qaboos have become more frequent, thanks to the expanding tourism sector in the 
Sultanate. In response, construction of a cruise terminal is underway at the 
port and it is expected to be ready by the end of the third quarter of this 
year. There are also plans to set up a duty-free shopping facility in the new 
terminal that would provide value-added services to international cruise 
tourists. Moreover, the Port Services Corporation has also carried out a 
feasibility study for constructing a new deep-draft berth and additional storage 
space to accommodate increased traffic. <br>
<br>
In the Sohar port, where OICT recently opened its Terminal B of Phase 1, the 
next 2-3 years will be marked by building and expansion activities. Large parts 
of the Sohar Industrial Port have been leased, though approximately 20 per cent 
of the land is still available. The ongoing Phase 3 of the port’s expansion 
comprises:</font><ul>

Port of Khasab in Musandam region, which is currently being expanded at the cost 
of RO15.8 million to cater to the economy of Musandam Governorate in particular, 
and the Sultanate’s economy in general. Besides, the government has recently 
signed RO46-million loan agreement with the Arab Fund for Economic and Social 
Development to finance the development of the Al Duqum port complex, located in 
the Al Wusta region. There are also plans to develop a dry dock near the port at 
the cost of RO100 million. Besides these ports, there are also specialised ports 
such as Mina Al Fahal, specialised in the export of oil, Qalhat Port for the 
export of LNG and other small ports in Shinas and Sur.</font></p>

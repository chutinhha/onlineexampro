<b>The landscape of Sohar Industrial area will never be the same again, with the

12 months ago, it did not exist. Today, it does. In concept and blueprint, if 
not in physical terms! The first Greenfield aluminium smelter project in over a 
quarter century in the entire Middle East, Sohar Aluminium is the port city’s 
dream project. The project’s size – US$2.4 billion (RO 926 million) – makes it a 
mammoth one. No wonder the smile on the face of Ahmed Al Wahaibi, Chairman of 
Sohar Aluminium, was rather wide on December 11, 2005 – a Red Letter Day, no 
doubt – as wannabe equity and technical partners gathered in Muscat to put their 
seal of approval to go ahead with the development of the project in Sohar.<br>
<br>
“It is quite incredible when I think that a little over a year ago, Sohar 
Alunimum did not exist. Today, we have a core team of 150 of the best people in 
the industry, ready to take this project forward,” gloats Tony Kinsman, Chief 
Executive Officer, Sohar Aluminium. His excitement is understandable. Given the 
size of the project and technical and other requirements, Kinsman and team 
literally burnt the midnight oil to hasten the process. <br>
<br>
<b>Suitable partners</b><br>
Roping in suitable partners was a daunting task for Sohar Aluminium project 
heads. Take a look at the shareholders to understand the enormity of the task at 
hand: Global aluminium giant Alcan of Canada has a 20 per cent equity in the 350 
kilotonne per year smelter, which is expected to begin production in the third 
quarter of 2008. State-owned Oman Oil Company SAOC is the major partner and Abu 
Dhabi Water &amp; Electricity Authority (ADWEA) is the third stakeholder in the 
prestigious project that will be using the proven AP35 technology, being used in 
a newly constructed smelter for the first time (See Box: Top Technology). <br>
<br>
Alcan Primary Group’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Cynthia Carroll, 
who was present on the historic day of project agreement signing and financial 
closure, said Sohar Aluminium would be a “world class project”. <br>
<br>
Sohar Aluminium was conceived in September 2004 and the equity is shared among 
Oman Oil Company, ADWEA and Alcan in 40:40:20 ratios. Bechtel has been appointed 
as the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) contractor of 
the smelter. European power giant Alstom will build a 1,000-MW capacity power 
station with the use of combined cycle turbines. ADWEA has chipped in to provide 
technical assistance in the construction and operation of the power plant. <br>
<br>
Soon after the Oman government began planning the Sohar Aluminium project, Oman 
Oil and ADWEA jumped onto the bandwagon. As per plans, the Greenfield project 
will be based near the existing Sohar Industrial Area. It is expected to provide 
a major economic boost to the Al Battinah Region of Oman. With the construction 
of a new Sohar Aluminium-owned 1,000 MW power plant, the smelter will have a 
long-term access to dedicated power supply on competitive terms and in a 
quantity that is sufficient to meet its energy requirements.<br>
<br>
Abu Dhabi’s intention to participate in the project was two fold. Primarily, 
this is a strategic project representing a “milestone in the path of bilateral 
brotherly joint cooperation between Abu Dhabi government and the Sultanate of 
Oman,” as HH Sheikh Diab Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Chairman of ADWEA, put it at the 
historic signing ceremony. Secondly, ADWEA’s expansion strategy comes as a 
result of its success in the privatization of the power generation sector. ADWEA 
is confident that such participation in the region will create the preliminary 
platform for the prospective GCC economic integration.<br>
<br>
<b>Money matters</b><br>
The other big challenge came in the form of procuring money to finance the 
mammoth project. December 11, the project-signing day, also witnessed global 
financiers taking part in this prestigious project. International and regional 
banks and financiers signed on the dotted lines to provide US$1.4 billion 
non-recourse term loan facilities. Significantly, Sohar Aluminium also bags the 
distinction of being the first project in Oman to avail of Islamic finance. A 
sum of US$240 million will come through the Islamic finance route. “We have the 
best technology, a first of its kind from Alcan and we also enjoy the 
distinction of bringing in the Islamic financing to Oman,” chuckles Kinsman.<br>
<br>
But for Chief Financial Officer Paul Snyman, arranging money at this scale is 
child’s play. He has been the key figure in several gigantic projects in the 
past. Chartered Accountant by profession, Snyman has more than 20 years of 
experience at CFO level in the mining and minerals industry. After serving a 
slew of mining giants in South Africa and Mozambique, he joined Sohar Aluminium. 
What’s the key to his success in sewing up financiers in the shortest possible 
time? “All finance documentation was finalised prior to approaching the 
short-listed 10 banks, for firm bids, this was the key to a smooth process and 
swift closure,” avers the financial wizard (See the Interview). Not only that, 
Snyman has to work extra hard to ensure that the project was adequately insured 
against all imponderables for which he roped in Al Ahlia, a Muscat-based 
insurance company ably supported by Marsh, their reinsurance brokers. <br>
<br>
Chairman Wahaibi is equally bullish: “With all ingredients of success, stable 
environment, government incentives, competitive gas and raw material supply 
contracts, strong sponsors and a management team that combines a wealth of 
expertise and experience in leading projects around the world, Sohar Aluminium 
will set a new benchmark for aluminium smelters around the world.” Kinsman too 
is excited about the project. The project will go on stream in the middle of the 
Seventh Plan (2006-2010) and is expected to make a significant contribution to 
Oman’s economy by creating job opportunities for Omanis and by creating 
opportunities for support services and downstream industries. Kinsman is also 
confident that Sohar Aluminium will emerge as the employer of choice in the days 
to come. </font></p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Business plan</b><br>
What is the business plan? “Initially, we plan to produce only remelt metal in 
the form of ingots and sows which will be exported,” explains Kinsman. In time, 
Sohar Aluminium hopes to develop its casthouse to produce alloys and shapes 
suitable for local downstream manufacture. “We have an ideal situation where 
downstream industries can be located adjacent to the smelter. Hot metal can be 
transported direct from the potlines to our customers thereby saving on the 
costing of cooling the metals and later reheating it,” he adds. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Kinsman is not unduly perturbed over meeting the self-imposed 
deadline of ensuring the project goes on stream in mid 2008. “We have the money. 
We have the best technology partners and the best support from all quarters. 
Where is the worry?” he asks rhetorically. <br>
<br>
As per the plans drawn up, preliminary work at the site has already commenced 
and actual construction is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2006. 
Kinsman is confident that pre-commissioning activities will be carried out end 
2007 and come mid-2008, and the first batch of aluminium should roll out. Not 
too far away. Only 30 months. For a greenfield project of such gigantic 
dimensions, such timelines are nothing unusual. It is worth waiting. </font></p>

    on the heels of sewing up the Greenfield aluminium smelter project, Sohar 
    Aluminium’s Chief Financial Officer, Paul Snyman, took time off to share his 
    thoughts with Ramesh Kumar on how he had gone about fetching money to 
    finance the project. Excerpts:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Given the size of the project (US$2.4 billion), did you find it difficult 
    to arrange for finance? </b><br>
    The strategy for arranging the finance was devised by the project’s 
    financial advisors, Citigroup, in consultation with the sponsors and Sohar 
    Aluminium. The process started with a market sounding exercise in April 
    2005, essentially a road show where the project was “sold” to the financial 
    markets. During this phase, some 30 banks and financial institutions, both 
    regional and international, were approached and requested to provide 
    indicative preliminary bids to provide non-recourse term loan facilities to 
    the project. <br>
    <br>
    Evaluation of the preliminary bids resulted in the selection of a group of 
    around 10 banks, which were requested to provide firm commitments based on a 
    fully documented finance package that had been developed by Sohar 
    Aluminium’s advisors. <br>
    <br>
    These firm bids were received in October-end and shortly thereafter, three 
    successful bidders were chosen. The three - ABN Amro, Citigroup and Sumitomo 
    Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) - together with a $200 million 
    contribution by Export Development Canada (EDC), thereby provided full 
    commitment for the term loan facilities by early November 2005.<br>
    <br>
    There was an excellent response to the initial underwriting phase that 
    followed. This resulted in the group of 17 banks that eventually signed up 
    in Muscat on 11 December. The full list of MLA banks that contributed to the 
    term loan facilities includes ABN Amro, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Arab Bank 
    &amp; Oman Arab Bank, Arab Banking Corporation, Bank Muscat, BNP Paribas, 
    Calyon, Citigroup, EDC, Gulf International Bank, ING, Mizuho, Royal Bank of 
    Scotland, SMBC, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and West LB. It is 
    gratifying to see the excellent support that the project enjoys from the 
    local and regional banks on this list.<br>
    <b><br>
    What kind of model of project finance have you deployed to ensure smooth and 
    swift closure?</b><br>
    All finance documentation was finalised prior to approaching the 
    short-listed 10 banks, as firm bids were the key to a smooth process and 
    swift closure. What this did was to practically eliminate the term 
    negotiation process that one would experience with other strategies. Another 
    important factor was that the project was fairly well developed in terms of 
    contractual documentation, which provided a good basis for a convincing 
    information memorandum to be presented to the financial markets.<br>
    <br>
    <b>The project is pretty huge. What about insurance against imponderables of 
    all kinds? </b><br>
    Insurance covering all the major perils that could arise during the 
    construction phase and that the company and its sponsors deemed necessary to 
    insure against, has been secured. Placement of the insurance in local and 
    international markets was expertly managed by the Al Ahlia, a Muscat-based 
    insurance company, that was selected in a competitive bidding process and 
    was well supported by Marsh, their reinsurance brokers.<br>
    <br>
    <b>According to documents, RO563.5 million will come from international and 
    regional banks and financiers in the non-recourse term loan facilities. What 
    is the dispersal schedule? When is the first draw down of this lot expected?
    </b><br>
    The term loan facilities totaling US$1.460 billion (RO 562 million), 
    together with a guarantee facility for US$85 million, have been catered for 
    by US$200 million from Export Development Canada, US$ 260 million Islamic 
    finance and US$1.085 billion commercial loan facilities. The debt will be 
    drawn down over the three-year period of construction with the first draw 
    down of some US$95 million due to be received by the company towards the end 
    of December 2005. Repayments will be spread over a period of 12 years 
    following the project’s completion.<br>
    <br>
    <b>A sum of US$240 million (almost 10 per cent of the total project finance) 
    is being raised through the Islamic banking route. Is it a single party 
    Islamic financing deal, or a consortium of Islamic bankers? </b><br>
    This is the first time that Islamic Finance has been used for a capital 
    project in Oman and it paves the way for access to this source of funding 
    for future projects in the country. As many as 11 of the 16 MLA banks have 
    Islamic financing capabilities and were able to provide a portion of their 
    commitment in this form.</font></td>

        One of the major highlights of the Sohar Aluminium project is its 
        technological excellence. The company, as part of first phase 
        development, will build and deploy a single AP35 potline, together with 
        associated carbon and casting facilities. It is considered to be the 
        best-proven technology available viz., Aluminium Pechiney’s AP35. 
        Moreover, it will be the first commercial use of this level of the AP 
        technology, which will be used for a full smelter project. No wonder 
        that Alcan of Canada is pumped up because it is “the venture” for them 
        in the region.<br>
        <br>
        According to Marco Palmiere, President of Alcan Primary Metal Group in 
        the Asia Pacific region, the AP35 technology, till now, has been used in 
        the upgrade of three existing smelters around the world. “This is the 
        most advanced, efficient and environmental-friendly technologies 
        available,” he claims. Alcan is a multinational, market-driven company 
        and a global leader in aluminium and packing. With world class 
        operations in primary aluminium, fabricated aluminium as well as 
        flexible and specialty packing, aerospace applications, bauxite mining 
        and alumina processing, Alcan today is well positioned to meet and 
        exceed its customers’ needs for innovative solutions and service. <br>
        <br>
        Simply put, what does it mean for Sohar Aluminium? “We are committed to 
        building it safely without any adverse impact on the environment. The 
        AP35 technology is an incremental improvement on the widely used AP30 
        technology,” points out Tony Kinsman, the CEO, and hastens to add that 
        this technology has been used at dozen or more potlines across the world 
        during the past 15 years.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, the Sohar Aluminium potline will be a little longer with 360 
        pots – as against the previous longest of 336 pots. What is the 
        advantage? According to Kinsman, together with the latest technology and 
        the longest potline, Sohar Aluminium will be able to churn out 350,000 
        tonnes of aluminium per year, which he proudly proclaims, will be the 
        highest production from any existing potline in the world.</font></td>

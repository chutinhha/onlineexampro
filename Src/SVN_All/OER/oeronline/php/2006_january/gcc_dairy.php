<img border="0" src="connectivity_track.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="129">Policy-makers 
in the Middle East realise the importance of a competent and swift transport 
system. In the next 5-7 years, the Gulf countries are expected to invest around 
RO3 billion on rail projects, according to industry estimates. In mid-December, 
leaders from the Gulf region came together under the banner of Gulf Traffic 2005 
Exhibition to brainstorm on the most talked about subject in the region.<br>
<br>
Some of the prestigious projects that are under various stages of implementation 
include Emirates Railway (UAE’s National Railway Network), Dubai Metro Rail, 
Riyadh Light Railway Project (Saudi Arabia), GCC Rail Network (linking all six 
Gulf states) and Arabian Railway Network.<br>
<br>
The proposed Emirates Railways would cost between RO1 billion and RO1.43 
billion, covering 700-1000kms, connecting Ruwais Industrial Area in Abu Dhabi to 
Ras Al Khaimah’s Port Saqr, Jebel Ali Port, Jebel Ali Airport City, Dubai city, 
Sharjah, Furairah port and Khorfakkan. In the first phase, only cargo 
transportation will be handled. In the second phase, the facilities will be 
extended to passengers as well. <br>
<br>
German Transport consultants Doriner is carrying out a feasibility study for the 
project and is expected to submit its report by September this year. According 
to its pre-feasibility study, the network can handle 16.5 million tons of cargo 
between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. If this network really comes into force, traffic 
along the inter-emirates network will be eased. The rail line is planned in such 
a way that it could be integrated with the GCC rail network in future.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, construction for the ambitious Dubai Metro project, also known as 
Dubai Light Rail Project, has finally started. A two line (Red and Green) fully 
automated and driverless system will run through a length of 69.7kms. 
Construction of phase one will finish in June 2009 and the construction of the 
second phase will start in 2007, to be completed by 2010. <br>
<br>
The Dubai Municipality awarded the RO1.24 billion contract to the Dubai Rapid 
Link (DURL) consortium headed by Mitsubishi Corp of Japan. The Red Line, which 
will be constructed in phase one, will run from Rashidiya Station to Jebel Ali 
Station. It will be 52.1km long with 4.7km of underground and a 47.4km elevated 
line. The Green Line, which will be constructed during phase two, will be 17.6km 
long with a 7.6km underground line in the business district of Dubai. It will 
run from Dubai Airport Free Zone to Dubai Healthcare City. A total 87 trains 
with five carriages each will run on these two lines. The fully operational 
system is expected to carry about 1.85 million passengers each working day with 
an annual total of 650 million passengers.<br>
<br>
Saudi Arabia also made considerable advancement in its railway expansion 
projects. The Riyadh Light Railway Project, linking the east and west coasts of 
Kingdom as well as the cities of Makkah, Madinah and Jeddah, has been making a 
remarkable headway. The project worth RO400 million will be open to private 
participation. The project involves construction of new tracks between Riyadh 
and Jeddah, and another 115-km line between Dammam and Jubail as well as 
upgrading the existing rail link between Riyadh and Dammam.<br>
<br>
Cargo trains will be able to cover the distance between Jeddah and Dammam within 
24 hours. The new railway project, once completed, will promote travel and 
freight transportation across the Gulf.<br>
<br>
GCC Linkage: Increasing trade and tourism has made governments across Gulf 
ponder over inter-transport connectivity. This thought has given birth to two 
significant projects – Arab Rail Network and GCC Rail Network. <br>
<br>
In July 2005, the GCC requested Saudi Arabia to carry out a technical study on 
the establishment of a GCC rail network. According to media reports, an initial 
study proposes construction of two lines, the first being 1,970km long and 
stretching from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and through a bridge to Qatar, 
and from there to the UAE and Oman. The second line would be 1,984km long 
running from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia to the UAE and Oman. Connecting points will 
be in Bahrain and Qatar. The cost was estimated to be RO2.2 billion.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the Arab Rail Network will stretch from the Syrian/Turkish 
border in the north to Aden in the south-west through Arabic-speaking North 
Africa to Mauritania on the Atlantic coast and as far east as the Iraqi border 
with Iran. North Africa, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania 
- all have existing railway lines, which would be utilised in the network 
covering over 25,000kms, said Murhaf Al Sabouni, General Secretary of the 
Syria-based Arab Railway Union.<br>
<br>
The roadmap for the Arab rail network is yet to be prepared. However, the Arab 
Railway Union proposed to connect the seven emirates of the UAE, considering its 
growing trade and tourism activities. <br>
<br>
Overall, massive investments across the region in future will depend on the 
effective mode of transportation of that country and its connectivity within the 
region. <br>

<img border="0" src="uae.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="52"></b></font>According 
to a survey carried out by the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, local 
insurance companies have expressed fears of domination by foreign insurance 
companies. Though many of the local companies expressed confidence that free 
trade agreements (FTAs) which the UAE is currently negotiating with many 
countries will help increase their business. Apprehensions are raised about “the 
invasion of Multi National Companies (MNCs)”. Overall, the industry is 
optimistic that the FTAs will increase competition and improve the services 
provided by the sector. In addition, they said it would open new areas and 
opportunities to improve business and decrease risks, extend the scope of 
e-commerce and develop new ways of marketing channels. <br>
<br>
The extent to which the lower-end popular insurance activities will provide 
opportunities to the foreign insurance companies will depend on the activities 
of the insurance companies from FTA countries and their degree of specialization 
in the respective activity. The survey showed that the most popular and common 
activities that are provided by all companies are automobile, fire, cargo and 
fixed property insurance. According to the survey, Dubai is considered to be the 
hub of insurance industry in the UAE. It hosts 49.4 per cent of the total 
establishments, followed by Abu Dhabi with 32.9 per cent and Sharjah with 10.4 
per cent. About 93 per cent of the operating establishments are hosted by the 
biggest three emirates.</font></p>

<img border="1" src="bahrain.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="42">Bahrain 
became the first Gulf country and the third Arab country to have a Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA) with the United States after the Senate gave the green signal to 
the agreement. Negotiations for the FTA began in January 2004 and the Agreement 
was signed in September that year. On November 18, 2005, the FTA was approved 
unanimously by the House and Senate Committees. In the full House of 
Representatives, the vote was 327-95 in favor of the FTA. Senate’s consent was 
the last hurdle in the legislative process. Upon US President George W. Bush’s 
signature, the FTA will become official.<br>
<br>
Two-way trade between these countries was nearly US $900million in 2003. US 
exports to Bahrain in 2003 totaled $509 million, including aircraft, machinery, 
vehicles, pharmaceutical products, toys, games and sports equipment. US exports 
of agricultural products to Bahrain in 2003 totaled $14 million, including 
poultry, snack foods, cotton, and processed fruit and vegetables. Bahrain’s 
exports to the US in 2003 were valued at $378 million, including articles of 
apparel and clothing accessories, aluminum, fertilizers, organic chemicals, 
mineral fuels and oils, plastics, and electrical machinery. The two-way foreign 
direct investment stands at about $195 million. When the agreement comes into 
force, 100 per cent of consumer and industrial products and 81 per cent of US 
agricultural exports will be duty free. Bahrain will open its services market 
wider than any previous FTA partner, streamline digital trade, protect 
intellectual property, facilitate government procurement, and provide for 
effective enforcement of labour and environmental laws.</font></p>

Gulf will never be the same again. In December 2005, the Custodian of the Two 
Holy Mosques King Abdullah launched the US$26.6-billion mega economic city 
project - christened The King Abdullah Economic City. The largest-ever joint 
venture in the Kingdom involving Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is to 
be built at a pristine location off the Red Sea.<br>
<br>
The new age city will have six distinct components: a modern world-class 
seaport, an industrial district, a financial island, an education zone, resorts 
and a residential area. The project will be completed in stages with the first 
batch of businesses and residents moving into the city within two years. Emaar 
Properties, the world’s largest real estate company in terms of market 
capitalization, will be the master developer of this ambitious project, the 
biggest outside of its home market of the UAE. SAGIA, the apex body responsible 
for inward investments into the Kingdom, is the prime facilitator for the 
development.<br>
<br>
SAGIA’s Investor Service Center will facilitate the provision of services to 
potential investors. Moreover, companies and investors would get licenses for 
implementing their projects in the city within a week after presenting 
applications. Central to the mega project is the creation of a 2.6 million 
square meter new Millennium Seaport similar in size to the world’s top 10 ports. 
With its strategic location on the Red Sea and the instant access to key cities 
within the Kingdom, the port will have a designated area for light industry and 
logistics and will be a natural platform for onward movement of goods to Europe, 
Africa, Asia and beyond. <br>
<br>
The Industrial District, covering 8 million square meters, will represent 
sectors such as downstream petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, research and 
development activities as well as a host of educational institutions. The 
waterside resort will serve up a most compelling mix of waterfront hotels and 
boutique residences. <br>
<br>
The master plan envisages 3,500 well-appointed hotel and residential bedrooms 
and suites, premium villas, plus an extensive retail element and an 
international-class signature 18-hole golf course and an equestrian club.<br>
<br>
The Financial Island will offer 500,000 square meters of office space for the 
leading international and regional financial services providers, business hotels 
and a new exhibition and convention center. There will be two towers reaching up 
to 160 stories that offer compelling views of the surrounding city skyline.</font></p>

Challenging times<br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
It is no longer just a grand sporting event, but an anthem every resident wakes 
up to. For the much-awaited Doha Asian Games 2006, the official countdown<img border="1" src="challenging_times.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="90"> 
had begun a year ago, on December 31, 2004. <br>
<br>
The West Asian Games (December 1-10, 2005) was the trial run not only for the 
athletes but for the organisers as well. It was the first big multi-sport event 
Doha hosted, and was the last chance the country could afford to make mistakes 
and rectify them. The 3rd West Asian Games got off to a colourful start at the 
Qatar Sports Club, which for the first time, allowed women to compete.<br>
<br>
The Games were contested by more than 1,400 athletes from 13 participating 
countries in 12 disciplines – athletics, bowling, basketball, diving, fencing, 
football, gymnastics, handball, swimming, shooting, volleyball and 
weightlifting. A total of 12 venues were used to conduct some 115 events. The 
10-day Games were held under the patronage of the Heir Apparent HH Sheikh Tamim 
bin Hamad Al Thani, who is also the president of the QNOC and chairman of the 
Doha Asian Games Organising Committee (DAGOC). <br>
<br>
History was made at the West Asian Games as women from five countries in the 
region competed in the swimming competition for the first time. The 17 women 
from Lebanon, Palestine, Qatar, Syria and Jordan competed in 10 events. West 
Asian Games brought to light the various challenges Doha faces in making 2006 
Games a success. After all, it will require a zero-tolerance approach. Hiccups 
faced in WAG will become an international fiasco if repeated in 2006. Here is 
one: The Syrian football team lost their way to match venue because of jumbled 
up travel plans. They missed their match against Oman after arriving at the 
wrong venue (Al Wakrah Stadium) instead of appearing at Al Gharrafah Stadium.<br>
<br>
The joke going around was that if the confused driver had been a Lebanese (he 
was an Asian), then this would have become a diplomatic ordeal for the country. 
Anyway, the facilities tested were just a fraction of what will be used next 
year, when tens of thousands of athletes from 45 countries participate in 39 
sports. Over 14 multi-purpose stadiums are being refurbished to host the events.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, Doha will have to bring together 15,000 volunteers to ensure 
the success of the Games. Unlike most other venues, a bulk of these volunteers 
will be expatriates. Doha won the rights to host the Games, beating strong 
contenders like Kuala Lumpur. And now, it will be closely scrutinised. Doha 
should remember that while every success will be applauded, every slip could 
well be magnified.<br>

Kobata’s vision is clear: Sharp at office and Sharp at home! He wants to see 
Sharp products stationed in most houses and offices in the Middle East. And he 
believes it is possible. As Senior Manager, Business Equipment Department (Sales 
and Marketing Division) handling the Middle East, he is bracing for a “war of 
sorts” to make this happen. The 30-plus Japanese “business warrior” is chalking 
out an aggressive marketing campaign for Sharp in the Middle East. <br>
<br>
“We want to capture the entire Gulf market in the digital-documental market,” 
informs the market-hungry Kobata during a recent visit to Muscat. Sharp is one 
of the leading Japanese electronics companies whose repertoire of business 
products ranges from digital copier/printers, data projectors, and 
facsimiles/multi-functions to scientific calculators and electronic organizers 
etc. The company has 15-20 per cent market share in the digital-documents 
industry in the Middle East and North Africa, says Kobata.<br>
<br>
The company has some exclusive plans up its sleeves for the Sultanate. “We are 
now shifting gear from the common product category to a clear-cut emphasis on 
the high-end (niche) products,” Kobata reveals. The focus, currently, is on 
positioning Sharp not merely as product suppliers but as total 
solutions-providers as well.<br>
<br>
But what exactly are his ‘aggressive’ plans? “The digital-document industry is 
undergoing a paradigm shift. Earlier, it was limited to the copier business. 
Now, the emphasis is on providing total solutions. And it is here that our 
advantage lies,” asserts Kobata. What about its market-share in Oman? As for the 
copiers, the company claims it has around 20 per cent share in the 
digital-documents market in the Sultanate. The Japanese giant sees a big scope 
for expansion in the light of the fact that the office-users in Oman now scout 
for more hi-tech products. High visibility therefore figures high on Kobata’s 
wish list these days. And as a corollary, the company’s local business partner, 
Oman Modern Electronics, is showing signs of the same aggressiveness that Kobata 
sports.<br>
<br>
But doesn’t the copier continue to be its main product in the digital-documents 
sector? “It is true. But now a copier machine is not just a copier machine. We 
at Sharp have evolved multi-functional products. We would like to provide total 
customer satisfaction to the users in the offices via our copier machines,” he 
makes it clear. “And, this will automatically provide impetus to other products 
of Sharp as well. Once people get to feel the multi-functional value of our 
copiers, they will automatically like to know about the other products of our 
company as well,” adds Kobata. <br>
<br>
In fact, the buzzword in copier today is the ‘b’ to ‘c’ movement - black and 
white to colour. And, the colour copier is the hot product. “It’s not that the 
black and white is fading out; rather it is going to merge with colour,” Kobata 
explains. the company has lined up a slew of multi-functional products for 
launch soon in Oman.<br>
<br>
Talking further about the market, Kobata says: “The trend has changed. Earlier 
people were quite happy to capture an image and have a copy of the same. The 
office environment has changed. People now scout for enlargement and 
multi-functions. Offices now have tender departments and document departments, 
which necessitates the need for high speed. We are coming into an age of 
document solution and document management. Once you get hooked up to the 
computer and the net, then it’s a different dynamics altogether.” Kobata goes a 
step further to add in the mould of a corporate-philosopher: “Colour has taken 
over so much of the industry. Every big corporate should have a colour copier 
now.”<br>
<br>
Sharp’s size and the variety of products it offers, the visitor believes, is its 
unique selling proposition. “It’s no surprise then that we are doing well in the 
Middle East. In some of the countries, we enjoys a 50-60 per cent market share,” 
says Kobata.<br>
<br>
Kobata also sees some sort of synergy between the UAE and Omani markets. 
According to him, the basic nature of the Dubai and Oman markets is quite 
similar. While the Dubai market is booming and has already moved to the high-end 
value, he predicts the same for Oman in the near future.<br>
<br>
Sharp’s focus in the next five years is going to be on digital-documents. Not 
surprisingly, Kobata dreams about his company occupying the top slot in each and 
every category. - Mehre Alam</font></p>

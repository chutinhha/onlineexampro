<b>Miles White, General Manager of Oasis Lifestyle LLC, does not believe in 
going by the book but would rather let common sense and experience lead the way</b><br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="at_the_helm.jpg" width="100" height="126" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">I 
came to Muscat about 20 months ago. I grew up in the UK where I did my schooling 
and also attended University. I did my graduation in Economics and History. I 
started working in my father’s company after which I joined Harrods. I actually 
joined Harrods after a bet with my friend who said I’d never work in retail. So 
I joined Harrods, with the bet on mind and with the intention of working there 
for a just day, but left the company only after six years as the Assistant 
Director. I then worked in New York and South Africa, where I set up a company, 
and later, for a short while in London. I came to the Middle East in 2002 when I 
got a job with ID Design in Kuwait. <br>
<br>
Last year I was offered a job in Oman and I flew down here for a day to see the 
place. And I liked it a lot. I was looking for a house with a garden since my 
daughter was just starting to walk. It’s not easy to afford a house with a 
garden in Kuwait, almost unimaginable. Since I was offered a job here and we 
could get a house with a garden, I decided to move to Muscat.<br>
<br>
<b>Management with a difference </b><br>
As the General Manager of Oasis Lifestyle LLC (which has under its umbrella the 
brands Zone, ID Design, Shop &amp; Shop, Bodum and Bombay), my responsibilities 
include just about everything from buying, pricing, advertising, marketing, 
human resources, operational management, and recruitment to budgeting. My team 
ably supports me in my work. I like to get the team involved in all the work I 
do. I try to encourage the staff to do as much as they can. I feel people should 
be allowed to do more than what has been assigned to them. I think you should 
give people as much free rein as possible. <br>
<br>
Many a time, those at the top take it as threat to their positions to let anyone 
in the team to do this. But I feel that getting people involved more is only a 
benefit to the company. That’s what all the top companies follow. <br>
<br>
I do not believe in following any particular management style because I don’t 
think there’s any absolute management principle. If there were one, then 
everyone would be following it. My management style is concerned with people and 
my interaction with them. I do not like to go by the books; I believe experience 
and common sense will get you through. <br>
<b><br>
Lifestyle market in Oman </b><br>
Oman is a developing market as far as lifestyle products are concerned. We are 
making gradual inroads in Oman. Our products are modern though we have a few 
traditional pieces. We cannot introduce ultra-modern products here, as the 
market is not yet ready to accept it. We do try to push the boundaries a little 
bit more every five to six months by getting modern pieces of furniture and 
products. At times we do bring in some extremely modern stuff to assess the 
market too.<br>
<br>
The collection we have right now in the store is well received by customers and 
those who have either been exposed to such a market or have a taste for such 
quality. <br>
<br>
<b>Bringing in changes </b><br>
My predecessor, who set up the store, did a great job with products that were 
niche and top of the range. He had styled the store in a very Danish fashion, 
with North European leanings. The furniture was very light in colour — beige, 
camel brown and sand brown. It is an easy sell among the Western Europeans but 
local market penetration was not taking place. So I added more colours and also 
changed some models of the lifestyle products and furniture we had. We also 
increased the products in the home accessories section. We don’t want to be just 
another shop selling household items. I’d rather have someone walk into the 
store and either fall in love or faint in horror!<br>
<br>
<b>Market limitations </b><br>
I don’t think there are any particular limitations here. You introduce very 
fashionable stuff here in Oman. May be five years down the line, the market 
might change.<br>
<br>
I think the government should allow provision for more sales and promotions to 
happen in the retail market. <br>
<br>
Right now, we are allowed to have only three sales every year. This does not 
help in creating brand excitement among people. If we had the opportunity to 
have more sales or customer-related events and promotions, the customer would 
get more interesting ways to shop. It will also be a good way of getting in more 
revenue. - Anne Kurian</font></p>

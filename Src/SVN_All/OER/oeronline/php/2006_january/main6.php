near, yet so far! That precisely seems to be the case with the proposed - and 
much-awaited - realty funds (mutual funds in real estate) in Oman. The Capital 
Market Authority (CMA), in a landmark decision early 2005, had approved 
regulations, allowing asset management companies (AMCs) to invest in the 
Sultanate’s real estate market with the rider that they seek prior permission 
from its board. <br>
<br>
The CMA announcement was hailed as historic, with market experts terming it as 
complementary to the booming real estate market in Oman and in the region. It 
was seen as the perfect pep for Oman’s capital market. Mutual funds, in any 
case, have a sizeable corpus at their disposal. So in one smart move, CMA opened 
the vistas for a wider investor base and greater market capitalization of the 
Muscat Securities Market (MSM), thereby hoping to improve market sentiments in 
the Sultanate. And more importantly, providing the market an alternative 
platform to invest and diversify the assets and portfolios.<br>
<br>
Little wonder then that the announcement evoked widespread elation among market 
experts. But it’s been almost a year now since that announcement. Realty funds 
should have hit the Sultanate’s market by now. But there is no sign of them. <br>
<br>
The CMA announcement, in fact, had come as part of new regulations that were 
approved by the CMA Board to encourage investors to park their funds in mutual 
fund schemes. AMCs have been investing in either equity instruments or bonds 
listed on the MSM. So, with the objective of encouraging investments in mutual 
fund schemes, the government also provided income tax exemption to mutual funds 
through a Royal Decree in early 2005. <br>
<br>
The new measures, circulated among investment companies, also aimed at 
regulating mutual funds in such a way that they could enhance the confidence of 
investors and encourage saving habits in the country. The idea was to encourage 
those with modest savings to indirectly invest in the stock market, which in 
turn would check conspicuous consumption. For, unlike investments in real 
estate, mutual fund schemes are easy to liquidate.<br>
<br>
Then, why the delay in realty funds? Is it a case of under-selling the idea? 
Suggests Zaigham H. Shah, Vice-President, Asset Management, Fincorp: “I think 
the CMA has to be more forthcoming in terms of such an announcement. It should 
be creating more awareness among the fund managers and investors. Of course, 
realty funds are a good asset class but the key issue is how to structure and 
market the whole idea. CMA should put more focus on propagating the idea.” <br>
<br>
But is it not the right idea for the AMCs to come together too, like they do in 
the other markets? “I agree that we ourselves have not been very pro-active in 
terms of receiving this idea and putting it into action,” admits Zaigham. As it 
turns out, the AMCs are yet to put forth their point, collectively, to the CMA.
<br>
<br>
<b>Nascence factor</b><br>
However, some experts believe this time lag is pretty normal and reject the need 
to get ultra-active with regard to the realty funds. Says Abdul Razak Ali Issa, 
Chief Executive, BankMuscat: “I understand many of our AMCs have initiated 
feasibility studies on such products.” And he presses his point further: “Though 
the real-estate sector is currently booming across the region and definitely 
showing bullish trends in the Sultanate as well, I would not think any serious 
AMC would like to rush into a new product category without gaining a detailed 
understanding of the segment in question. I believe many could possibly be in an 
early stage of product development.” Ali is seconded by Lo’ai Badie Bataineh, 
DGM–Investment, Head of Investment Management Group, Oman Arab Bank. “Give us 
some more time. As fund managers, we need to educate our clients about the new 
developments.” <br>
<br>
Sivaraja, an analyst at Fincorp, also points out at the “nascence factor”: “In a 
developed market, the reactions will be faster and quicker. But in a developing 
market, especially where the importance of the capital markets is being felt 
slowly, the reaction does come a bit late.” <br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="sp_rep1.jpg" width="198" height="167" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2">Structural bottlenecks</b><br>
But is there more to the delay than the nascence factor alone? What about other 
bottlenecks? Are there any more structural hindrances that have not yet been 
sorted out? Lo’ai believes there still are some roadblocks left with regard to 
the regulations. “The tax holding issue is still not clear,” he points out. And 
there are other concerns too. “We were mulling over going for real estate 
finance in Oman. But we discovered that even expatriates living in the Sultanate 
for 30-40 years can buy or own apartments or a piece of land only in notified 
areas, and not everywhere.” <br>
<br>
Adds Zaigham: “The problem is that you do not have proper real estate market in 
Oman. And fund managers do not have the expertise to buy real estate. So, there 
has to be an instrument, which is linked to the real estate. We cannot ourselves 
invent such a product. Although we have witnessed a huge boom in the real estate 
market in Oman, there is still no structured instrument where you can invest and 
get returns in an efficient manner.” Concurs Lo’ai: “I guess most investment 
companies do not have experience in real estate. In fact, Oman’s real estate 
market itself is not well developed. So if you ask me, I’ll still go for a real 
estate advisor.”<br>
<br>
Then, there is this all-important issue of investment cap. As per the CMA 
decision, AMCs have been allowed to invest only 40 per cent of their assets in 
the real estate. So the law itself needs to be amended to allow the AMCs to 
invest 100 per cent of their assets in real estate. In fact, this amendment is 
already on the agenda of the CMA Board (See interview of HE Abdullah bin Salem 
Al-Salmi, Executive Vice-President-Regulatory Affairs, CMA). 
<img border="0" src="sp_rep2.jpg" width="151" height="167" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2"><br>
<br>
<b>Hope 2006</b><br>
However, there is still light at the end of the tunnel as far as realty funds 
are concerned. 2006 holds promise. Some realty funds might see the light of the 
day now. “It’s coming,” confirms Lo’ai of Oman Arab Bank. Maybe in the first 
quarter of 2006.<br>
<br>
BankMuscat’s CEO Abdul Razak, too, oozes optimism: “I do believe we shall see 
the leading players in the local market becoming increasingly active in this 
sector in the near future, though I would not like to be pinned down to a 
definite time frame. What we must not forget is that large real estate projects 
often have long gestation periods; the sector, therefore, requires careful 
study, particularly in the short to medium term.” <br>
<br>
At one point Fincorp was at a stage of launching a real estate fund and was 
negotiating and it has not given up as yet. Market speculation is rife that 
BankMuscat will have the honour of being the first off the starting block.<br>
Whether the realty funds hit the market sooner or later, the fact is that they 
have the potential to effect huge changes on the capital market scene in the 
Sultanate. <br>
<br>
The CMA decision has enabled local AMCs to enhance their product portfolios. As 
can be derived from the regional experience, real estate based investment 
products are attracting significant investor interest, as more and more 
investors are willing to put their money into these funds. - Mehre Alam</font></p>

    Abdullah bin Salem Al-Salmi, Executive Vice-President – Regulatory Affairs, 
    Capital Market Authority (CMA), tells Mehre Alam in a candid interview. 
    Excerpts:</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>In February 2005, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) had approved 
    regulations allowing mutual funds to invest in the Sultanate’s real estate 
    market. What prompted you to issue the notification? </b><br>
    In the past there were complaints from Asset Management Companies (AMCs) 
    regarding taxation, tax on dividends and capital gains and we really tried 
    our best with the Ministry of Finance and the Government in general to amend 
    the taxation law. And that happened. Now, the mutual funds are completely 
    tax-free (100 per cent). Yet, we have not seen any real development. Then, 
    it was brought to our notice that the existing law permits the funds to 
    invest in the securities market only. That’s why we came up with this 
    circular, allowing mutual funds to invest part of their equities in other 
    investments, rather than limiting them to the stock exchange only. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Between then and now, has any AMC come out with any real estate-specific 
    funds?</b><br>
    Yes, we have seen two such funds but both the funds were not really focusing 
    on Oman. They were focusing on the region (GCC and MENA). So we really want 
    some funds to be really concentrating in real estate and other investment 
    opportunities in Oman. There are plenty of opportunities in Oman and 
    liquidity as well. We need to come up with proper instruments that pool this 
    liquidity.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What kind of handholding would the CMA like to extend? </b><br>
    We, as regulators, are here to find out if there are any obstacles - legal 
    or otherwise - that might hinder the operation of mutual funds. We are ready 
    to listen to any suggestions. And we have listened to, for example, on the 
    issue of taxation and such things. We are open to any suggestions from the 
    asset managers in Oman.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Did they (AMCs) get back to you?</b><br>
    Well, they do come to us when they have any specific issues. And we do our 
    best to iron out their difficulties and come up with solutions. For example, 
    two asset management companies came to us and pointed about one of the 
    issues in the law, which when interpreted, means that mutual funds are 
    basically for investment in the MSM or in the securities market. So we went 
    to our Board to get the clarification whether mutual funds may invest in the 
    other investments as well. After the clarification from the Board, we 
    allowed the AMCs to invest up to 40 per cent of their assets in real estate. 
    But I do agree that we need to work out some sort of amendment to the law to 
    allow pure mutual funds to invest in the real estate. We have already 
    started moving in this direction.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Will you be calling the AMCs in the near future to take the process 
    forward? </b><br>
    Well, I think we need to fix our home first. And then, we will call the 
    AMCs, may be for a conference, but we need to have the law to cater for such 
    an issue. We are getting these things as, what I would call it, an exemption 
    from the law. We did allow the funds to invest up to 40 per cent of their 
    assets in the real estate. But we need to get the law amended in order to 
    allow 100 per cent of the assets to be invested into the real estate.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Are you in talks with other ministries to get this amendment moved in?</b><br>
    We have been working out the amendments here at the CMA. And discussing it 
    with the Ministry of Legal Affairs. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Could we hope to see something concrete on the realty funds soon?</b><br>
    We hope so. However, if the asset managers want to set up a fund 
    specifically for real estate, they can go through other route. Setting up an 
    SAOG company, for example. Instead of calling it a fund, they can call it a 
    company. The company law really allows that.<br>
    <br>
    <b>When is the amendment likely to come?</b><br>
    It takes some time. From the CMA, it can move in a week or a month. But the 
    process has to go through various stages - the Cabinet, and the Ministry of 
    Legal Affairs.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Where is it right now? At which stage is it currently? </b><br>
    Right now, it’s with the CMA.</font></td>

    Estate Mutual Funds, also known as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and 
    Listed Property Trusts (LPTs), are defined as collective investment tools 
    that pool money from investors and use the pooled capital to buy, manage and 
    sell real estate assets. These funds are common to many economies with a 
    developed property market. Generally, they are closed-ended companies or 
    trusts that hold, manage and maintain real estate for investment purposes, 
    which is leased to tenants. <br>
    <br>
    They tend to have a broad shareholder base and are often, but not always, 
    traded on a public stock. For publicly traded entities and property owners, 
    these funds provide the benefits of converting their commercial properties 
    to marketable securities thereby unlocking the investment value of such 
    properties. For the investors, these provide a viable investment alternative 
    that offers a wider investment choice and a greater portfolio 
    diversification. In the USA, REITs have been in operation since late 
    nineteenth century, Australia launched them in early 1970s, Japan and Korea 
    in 2001, France in 2003, the UK and Germany are considering introducing them 
    in 2006.<br>
    <br>
    While the first REITs and Listed Property Trusts in the US and Australia 
    have been around for some time, their growth was most impressive after the 
    1987 &quot;Black October&quot; market crash. The capitalisation of US-listed REITs 
    rose by nearly 13 times to US$155 billion between 1991 and 2001. Today, 
    about 200 publicly traded REITs with assets total over $500 billion are 
    operating in the United States. Approximately two-thirds of these trade on 
    the national stock exchanges. <br>
    <br>
    In Australia, the capitalisation of LPTs rose from A$5 billion to about A$45 
    billion between 1992 and late-2002, a rise of nine times. Starting with the 
    first LPT in 1971, there are now about 30 LPTs in Australia, accounting for 
    some 8 per cent of the total worth of listed stocks. The LPT sector has been 
    one of the strongest performing sectors of the Australian Stock Exchange 
    (ASX) since 1994.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Revenue model</b><br>
    REITs buy, develop and sell property and share profits with 
    investors/unit-holders from any capital appreciation on the sale of 
    property. Apart from sale of property, real estate funds also make money 
    from rentals on property owned by them. On the basis of their revenue model, 
    real estate funds are generally classified into the following three broad 
    categories.<br>
    <br>
    (a) Equity Funds: Equity real estate funds invest in and own properties 
    (thus responsible for the equity or value of their real estate assets). 
    Their revenues come principally from their properties' rents. In the US 
    these funds are most popular and account for more than 90 per cent of total 
    assets under management.<br>
    <br>
    (b) Mortgage Funds: Mortgage real estate funds deal in investment and 
    ownership of property mortgages. These funds loan money for mortgages to 
    owners of real estate, or invest in (purchase) existing mortgages or 
    mortgage backed securities. Their revenues are generated primarily by the 
    interest that they earn on the mortgage loans.<br>
    <br>
    (c) Hybrid Funds: Hybrid real estate funds combine the investment strategies 
    of Equity REITs and Mortgage REITs by investing in both properties and 
    mortgages.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Important factors in a vibrant real estate fund market</b><br>
    A lower interest rate regime and availability of a large pool of good 
    properties in the market are the two most important factors in emergence and 
    development of a vibrant real estate fund market. Income level and 
    investible surplus in the hands of potential investors, tax incentive 
    available to the real estate funds and investors in these funds, comparable 
    risk return ratio in other investment options like bonds, stocks, equity 
    funds, liquidity and accessibility of these funs to investors are some other 
    factor which impact the development of these funds.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Advantages of real estate funds</b><br>
    The experience of countries like the US, Australia and Japan shows that real 
    estate funds invariably result in improvement in the quality and quantity of 
    finance available for investment in commercial and residential property. 
    Besides, it allows the investors the access to a wider range of savings 
    products on a stable and well-regulated basis. Most significantly, 
    successful operation of these funds could provide tremendous support to the 
    process of structural changes in property markets to reduce costs and 
    improve flexibility and quality for tenants. From the viewpoint of 
    investors, it allows even smallest of investors to access commercial 
    property returns, otherwise available only with significant capital outlays, 
    risk of illiquidity and tax inefficiency. It is also seen to help in 
    improving stability in the property investment market by rebalancing some 
    debt with equity among property companies. These funds are normally seen to 
    be having different cycles from the bond and equity markets. <br>
    <br>
    They therefore make for prudent investment by individuals, pension funds and 
    life assurance companies wishing to reduce risk by maintaining a diversified 
    portfolio. In fact, by investing in mutual funds that operate in the real 
    estate space, an investor can periodically invest (depending on his savings) 
    in the same asset class that he finally wants to make a lump sum investment 
    in i.e. house, office or shop etc. To the corporates, it provides an 
    opportunity to release property assets from corporate balance sheets into 
    professionally managed companies. </font></td>

            posts dull year at box office<br>
            <br>
            </b>The euphoria of King Kong, Harry Potter and Star Wars failed to 
            arrest the box office fortune of Hollywood movies in year 2005. The 
            year witnessed the biggest decline in movie attendance in 20 years.<br>
            <br>
            The domestic revenues at movie theaters are expected to have fallen 
            below $9 billion after hovering around $9.3 billion for the last few 
            years. Many industry experts are blaming the lack of good movies for 
            the dwindling fortune of Hollywood. Some experts say that people 
            have reduced their visits to the movie theatres in favour of the 
            comfort of their home where they watch their favourite movies on 
            home theatre systems only a few months after their theatrical 
            release.<br>
            <br>
            According to an Associated Press-AOL News survey, 73 percent of 
            adults said that they preferred watching movies at home instead of 
            paying a visit to the theatre. No wonder, number of big movies 
            failed to live upto the box office expectations. 2006 is expected to 
            be better for the Hollywood.</font></p>

            <img border="0" src="google.jpg" align="left" width="132" height="52">America 
            Online and Google have announced a $1-billion deal to expand their 
            partnership, in a move aimed at boosting their respective Internet 
            advertising revenues. While complete details of the deal are yet to 
            be made public, AOL and Google said the latter will pay $1 billion 
            for a 5 percent stake in AOL, valuing the company at $20 billion 
            overall. AOL will be able to sell Google's search-related ads to 
            appear on AOL properties. <br>
            <br>
            The terms of the agreement were reached in New York in the Time 
            Warner office suite of CEO Richard Parsons, where he was joined by 
            Google CEO Eric Schmidt and AOL's Miller. The deal includes the 
            prospect of adding more graphical ads throughout the Google network, 
            though specifics remained vague. In addition, Google and AOL would 
            enable users of their respective instant messaging services - Google 
            Talk and AIM - to communicate with each other. AOL also will get an 
            opportunity to have its content featured more prominently on Google.
            <br>
            <br>
            Time Warner chairman and chief executive officer Dick Parsons said 
            he expected the deal would benefit all of his company, not just AOL. 
            &quot;As digital technologies continue to drive industries together, the 
            great value and opportunity inherent in Time Warner's structure and 
            array of premier businesses becomes increasingly clear,&quot; Parsons 
            said. &quot;A critical piece of this strategic alliance will be our 
            content, which we will be making more accessible to Google users,&quot; 
            he added. <br>
            <br>
            Google CEO Eric Schmidt said the move should help connect Google's 
            users to more content. &quot;AOL is one of Google's longest-standing 
            partners, and we are thrilled to strengthen and expand our 
            relationship,&quot; Schmidt said.</font></p>

            OPEC in talks with China</b><img border="1" src="opec.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="124" hspace="5" vspace="2"><b><br>
            </b><br>
            The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opened its 
            first talks with China in December, as the cartel gears up to face stronger 
            competition from Russia to supply China, the world's second biggest 
            oil importer. <br>
            <br>
            Adnan Shihab-Eldin, the acting secretary general of OPEC, and Sheik 
            Ahmad Fahad al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister and 
            president of OPEC, met with Chinese officials in Beijing. Industry 
            analysts expected the discussions to concentrate on increasing 
            Chinese imports from OPEC countries, which supplies about 40 percent 
            of the world's oil.<br>
            <br>
            Analysts also suggested that the talks would allow OPEC to negotiate 
            major investments in China's refining industry, as proposed by 
            cartel members in a bid to secure market share. China's burgeoning 
            economic growth has driven its demand for oil, which has increased 
            at an average of 24 percent a year over the last decade.<br>
            <br>
            From being a net oil exporter in 1993, China has become the second 
            biggest oil importer behind the United States. Of the 6.7 million 
            barrels of oil a day consumed in China in 2004, almost half came 
            from imports, according to industry statistics.<br>

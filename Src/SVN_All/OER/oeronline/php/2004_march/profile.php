                    Ebrahim meets with Fauziya Ghazi Al-Araimi, Group Human 
                    Resources Manager at W.J. Towell, who has an unequivocal and 
                    strong-willed approach to doing business</b></font></p>
                    <p align="justify">
                    <font face="Verdana" size="1">If you want to reach her for 
                    an appointment, call her before 4 p.m. She’s strictly not 
                    available for work after the said time. And she makes sure 
                    her employees too are heading out by that time. “Why should 
                    we work late? I believe that one should have a healthy life 
                    and a good time out of office too. If you don’t have a good 
                    personal life, how can you expect a rewarding professional 
                    life?” asks Fauziya Ghazi Al-Araimi, Group Human Resources 
                    Manager, W.J.Towell. As her designation insinuates, she’s 
                    out there to counsel, motivate, cheer and help her 
                    colleagues and team members lead a fantastic professional 
                    and content personal life. <br>
                    <br>
                    A woman of few words, she’s proud of the fact that she is 
                    able to get cent per cent employee satisfaction in her 
                    company. And, how? “We give our employees the required 
                    leverage and in return we get top-quality work. It’s a give 
                    and take.” Perhaps, handling people comes naturally to 
                    Fauziya, who thrives on her employees’ happiness. And hence 
                    it’s no surprise to see that “the employee turnover in my 
                    company is less than one per cent.” Wow! She adds: “Managers 
                    are coaches to their employees. We should serve as an 
                    example to them. People are in love with their job, so you 
                    call them anytime to work, they’ll rush in. But they also 
                    need to understand that their body needs rest. And only if 
                    they get that respite will they come in fresh the following 
                    day, which also means that there’ll be more fresh ideas and 
                    added enthusiasm at work.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Fauziya is just two-year-old in her current employment, but 
                    her penchant and drive to grow to be of significant value to 
                    the society started a long time back. “I started my career 
                    as any other normal employee 15 years back, and continued 
                    with my studies alongside. But I had the fire in me to move 
                    on, and that’s what brought me to where I am today,” says 
                    this management degree holder from the Cambridge University. 
                    She cites examples of how the right kind of inspiration and 
                    support can reap one reward. Without disclosing the names, 
                    she says there are Deputy Managers in her organisation who 
                    were once drivers. That’s some commendable achievement! <br>
                    <br>
                    Passionate about her job, Fauziya feels the challenge is in 
                    handling her employees the right way. “People have feelings. 
                    I deal with hearts and minds. And unlike machines, people 
                    need to be handled with care. They have emotions and hence 
                    each individual has to be handled independently and 
                    efficiently,” she asserts. The W.J.Towell umbrella serves as 
                    a cover for about 700 employees. “And I deal with all of 
                    them. We get involved with them right from the time we 
                    select and recruit them. We educate and train them. We 
                    understand them,” she says while firmly placing her cup of 
                    tea on the table. <br>
                    <br>
                    For Fauziya, her employees’ problems are her problems. She, 
                    along with her team members, handles personal issues in a 
                    way that is fair to the employee as well as to the company. 
                    She stresses: “Whether it is an expatriate or a national, an 
                    employee is the asset of the company. Without them the 
                    machines wouldn’t work, the office wouldn’t function and the 
                    goals wouldn’t be met.” <br>
                    <br>
                    And how does she get rewarded for all this? “I value the 
                    happiness of my employee more than the certificates and 
                    mementoes that I receive. It’s a great high to see them 
                    smile because when they come into my room, they are all 
                    worried and stressed out, but when they go out, they’re 
                    smiling, and smiling with joy!” She recalls that WJ Towell 
                    has expatriates that have been working for the company for 
                    well over 30 years and Omanis working there for more than 35 
                    years. What’s worth mentioning is that the ex-employees’ 
                    children have started joining the company. “If the 
                    organisation doesn’t place its trust in the employee, they 
                    wouldn’t want to invest their genuine efforts in the 
                    company.”<br>
                    <br>
                    In her last assignment, Fauziya served as the Managing 
                    Director of Sur Plastics, one of her own projects and an 
                    organisation, which she claims was the beginning of her life 
                    in the industrial and private sector. She goes on to say 
                    that as a young entrepreneur, she had put in all the efforts 
                    required to build up a factory.<br>
                    <br>
                    “In two years time, I was chosen among 16 businessmen, as 
                    the Member of the Businessmen Council, which was through the 
                    instruction of His Majesty. It’s a moment I’m proud of.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Fauziya feels good about the fact that she’s ‘Made in Oman’. 
                    “In Oman, men and women enjoy a lot of equal powers, in 
                    terms of opportunities, laws and procedures. <br>
                    <br>
                    All labour laws are equal as it is applicable to the 
                    ‘employee’ and not specifically to the men or the women. Of 
                    course, women are given more liberty in terms of working 
                    hours. It’s just to add to her security,” she says.<br>
                    <br>
                    Though work is a part of her life, that’s not all. This 
                    thirty seven-year-old, mother-of-four, loves diving and 
                    swimming and of course, music. “I love the sea, and so do my 
                    kids. Besides that, I also go wadi bashing and play squash. 
                    And there are times I take to glass painting too.” 
                    Consistently creating something new to look forward to, 
                    Fauziya has learnt to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. 
                    “Everyone has highs and lows in their lives, but it’s only 
                    when you go through one, that you realise the value of the 
                    other. In fact, without the ups and downs in life, I 
                    wouldn’t be Fauziya,” she avers. It is very apparent then 
                    that it’s her strength that remains the one constant and 
                    indelible reminder of the joy in her workplace and at home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Proud, she is of many factors including the 33 per cent 
                    Omanisation they have in the organisation. And 50 per cent 
                    they aim to achieve in the next five years. “Each year we 
                    are considering 10 per cent increment with regard to 
                    Omanisation depending on the number of vacant positions.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Unassuming as she may sound, Fauziya is unequivocal and 
                    strong-willed and has the courage of her convictions. While 
                    her role as a manager is commendable, she clearly stays away 
                    from work when it comes to matters of her family. “I don’t 
                    like to carry my work home. It’s supposed to be the time for 
                    my children and my family.” She also goes on to add how a 
                    good support system like one’s family, could help one move 
                    ahead in life. “But first, you have to get your engine 
                    working.” She has equally strong views when it comes to 
                    marriage. “It’s a company with a partnership. And we should 
                    learn to work things out in tandem.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Unwittingly modest, Fauziya is quite clear about what she 
                    wants in life. She keeps her engine working for herself and 
                    for the betterment of others. All said and done, the 
                    untarnished sophistication in her voice echoes of laurels 
                    but this manager certainly has her head firmly placed on her 
                    shoulders. </font></p>

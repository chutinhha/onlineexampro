            Branding New Identity</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>
            Oman’s companies are inventing new identities for themselves so that 
            they can become the winners of tomorrow. Nayl D’Souza looks at the 
            potential success such changes can bring about</b></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <b>What is corporate rebranding?<br>
            <img border="0" src="cover1.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" width="250" height="170"></b>From 
            the outset we must differentiate between ‘rebranding’ and 
            ‘repositioning’. As companies evolve, it is natural for them to 
            fine-tune their mission statement and scope of business as markets 
            change and opportunities arise. In doing so, they may diversify 
            their operations or reposition themselves to the point where they 
            may need to slightly modify their corporate communications but in 
            such instances there is nothing so drastic as a name change or 
            rebranding involved.<br>
            <br>
            It is also crucial that we distinguish the difference between 
            ‘changing a logo’ and ‘rebranding’. “Changing a logo implies a 
            visual change to a company’s badge which may simply be a cosmetic 
            adjustment,” explains Riaan Muller, Client Manager for Landor 
            Associates. “Rebranding, on the other hand, is driven by business 
            issues, and not only affects the visual manifestations of the brand 
            such as its visual identity, but also has implications across all 
            forms of communications, actions and behaviours to all audiences, 
            whether they be internal or external.”<br>
            <br>
            Whether it be to keep a company’s relevance at any given time, to 
            energise tired emotional brand values, to reinvigorate sales or to 
            improve a company’s bottom line, organisations around the world are 
            clambering for new corporate identities. And this craze<br>
            for rebranding shows no sign of abating. For example, the negative 
            association of the word “fried” in Kentucky Fried Chicken stimulated 
            the move to the name to KFC. Another example most marketers will be 
            familiar with is the forced name change of Gerald Ratner’s jewellery 
            stores from Ratners to Signet after he described the products 
            Ratners sold in a derogatory manner.<br>
            <br>
            In recent years, the Gulf region has also seen a flurry of companies 
            be renamed while many have given their visual identity a face-lift 
            to revive flagging fortunes. Most have also had to decide on a new 
            strategy in their brand delivery, service and promise.<b><br>
            </b> </font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
            </b>The impressive closing ceremony to the Muscat Festival last 
            month was the cue for organisers to begin stripping the city’s 
            highways of related paraphernalia and sponsorship hoardings. Bank 
            Dhofar, Oman’s fourth largest bank and one of several major sponsors 
            of the event, has reaped many benefits of supporting the month-long 
            extravaganza. The bank launched a shorter name, a new logo and a 
            different slogan earlier this year to coincide with the marketing 
            drive surrounding the festival. It was a big moment for the bank – 
            its first new look in 24 years and clearly a radical change in 
            visual identity to boot.<br>
            <br>
            Most of Oman’s banks have been tweaking their corporate identities 
            in ways they feel have been relevant and meaningful to consumers and 
            stakeholders. Bank Dhofar’s new makeover has generated much 
            admiration from the national press. Clearly, the change, which was 
            meant to delicately blend time-honoured banking traditions with new 
            age ideas, will appeal to young and old as it begins to work its 
            charm on the general public and the business community as well. Yet 
            how successful the bank’s transformation has been will ultimately 
            depend on whether the new identity has been correctly crafted, 
            communicated, perceived, understood, accepted and taken to heart.<b><br>
            <br>
            </b>“It is still too early to really know how people feel [about 
            Bank Dhofar’s new identity]. However, the initial response has been 
            very good. No one has told us that they miss the old symbol as our 
            values and work ethics remain the same,” asserts Ahmed Ali Al 
            Shanfari, Bank Dhofar’s chief executive. <b><br>
            <br>
            </b>The initial brainwave to revamp Bank Dhofar’s corporate identity 
            came two years ago from a desire to be seen as modern and in touch 
            with its markets. The project started around the middle of last year 
            – coincidently after the bank’s merger with Majan International Bank 
            and not as a consequence of it. The shortened name is far less of a 
            mouthful than the one it replaces. ‘Bank Dhofar Al-Omani Al-Fransi’ 
            was often shortened to Bank Dhofar anyway. What’s more, the name had 
            become outdated following France’s BNP Paribas decision to dispose 
            of its six per cent minority stake in the bank at the end of 2001.<br>
            <br>
            Bank Dhofar laments that what it has undertaken is cosmetic surgery 
            rather than a re-birth. “This was not so much a rebranding 
            initiative as it was a rejuvenation of an already well established 
            brand. Bank Dhofar’s new identity, from logo to typography to core 
            message, clearly reflects the values that have laid the foundations 
            for our current success while noticeably stating that we have big 
            plans for the future,” explains Al Shanfari.<b><br>
            </b><br>
            Having already secured its first international mid-term loan of $75 
            million (RO29 million) from leading regional and international banks 
            last month, Bank Dhofar’s management can feel pleased that they are 
            capitalising on their bank’s new garb as well as taking advantage of 
            excess liquidity in the market as they plan to undertake ambitious 
            growth of their business.<br>
            <b><br>
            So which companies have rebranded?<br>
            </b>It’s difficult enough to cosmetically overhaul a powerful brand 
            in order to sustain sales, profit and brand loyalty, but it’s a 
            notoriously tricky challenge to rebrand – particularly at the 
            corporate level. The risks are great and the decision shouldn’t be 
            taken lightly.<br>
            <br>
            “Rebranding is usually an expensive, time-consuming and risky 
            activity that should only be undertaken when there is a clear 
            marketing and financial case in its favour and a strong marketing 
            plan in place to support its implementation,” according to marketing 
            guru David Jobber.<b><br>
            </b><br>
            Seemingly, probably the best example of a meticulously planned 
            rebranding campaign is the one developed by Oman Oil Marketing Co. (OOMC). 
            It began in September 2003 as a result of BP’s exit from the Omani 
            petroleum retail market. Ironically, a few months earlier, the 
            erstwhile company BP Oman was beginning to replace its tired looking 
            shield with the new sunflower-shaped Helios mark and a fashionably 
            lower case ‘bp’ on petrol stations. Nowadays, however, the latest 
            sight adorning petrol stations up and down Oman’s highways (79 
            filling stations to be precise when the rebranding is completed by 
            the end of April 2004) is the symbolic combination of mena blue, 
            wadi green, kingfisher blue and platinum shine into a bright, 
            layered, curvy logo and associated wordmark ‘Omanoil’. <br>
            “We are not just rebranding a fuel commodity but the whole customer 
            experience whether it is visiting one of our filling stations 
            throughout Oman or having a business- to business relationship or 
            any interaction with OOMC staff,” explains Paul Phillips, retail<br>
            manager for OOMC. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Hiring professionals can be costly</b><br>
            After deciding to rebrand, OOMC formed an internal steering 
            committee to direct the overall process and decided to bring in 
            worldrenowned companies to assist its work. Accenture was chosen to 
            help the company optimise its infrastructure and management<br>
            processes during the change. Landor Associates was selected to help 
            formulate the Omanoil brand (a company already responsible for 
            sprucing up BP’s logo as well as recently re-imaging the Gulf Air 
            corporate identity and aircraft livery). Finally, AC Nielson was 
            appointed to chip in with qualitative market research. This included 
            10 focus groups with varying demographic mixes conducted in Muscat, 
            Nizwa and Sohar as well as focus group discussions conducted with BP 
            Oman staff, and one-to-one meetings with members of BP Oman’s Board 
            of Directors and key filling station dealers. Clearly, with so many 
            reputable helpers, Omanoil’s rebranding has been an expensive but 
            thoroughly professional procedure.<b><br>
            <br>
            </b>Phillips of OOMC is untroubled by the expense of rebranding 
            because the company has made an allowance for this. “As BP Oman, we 
            paid royalty fees to BP which cease when the brand is no longer used 
            and saving from not paying these fees will help to fund the 
            rebranding,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            Although it admits to having invested a tidy sum in the venture, 
            Bank Dhofar is equally unfazed by the cost of its revamping 
            exercise.&nbsp; Although the bank’s new logo was the outcome of 
            advertisements the bank placed in the local and UAE media asking for 
            designs from professionals and amateurs, the overall corporate 
            identity of Bank Dhofar was implemented by Dubai- 20 21 OER March 
            2004 based Tamra C2 – a company responsible for the development of 
            Emirates Bank International’s meBANK brand. The greatest expense of 
            the project, however, will probably come about from the bank’s 
            efforts to rollout its new identity in branches and on signage, 
            ATMs, stationery and many other items within the next couple of 
            months. “You will appreciate that such an initiative requires that 
            the bank spends a significant amount. While this amount is on the 
            higher side it is an investment into our brand identity that will 
            take us forward for many years to come and is therefore justified,” 
            remarks Al Shanfari. <br>
            <b><br>
            </b>The fact that many revamping and rebranding exercises are being 
            outsourced to companies abroad demonstrates two market realities as 
            far as local business people are concerned. Firstly, companies in 
            Oman are slowly but surely taking the management of their corporate 
            identity more seriously. Secondly, Oman’s burgeoning communications 
            companies (and associated service agencies such as those that deal 
            in market research) which have received criticism of late are not 
            being trusted to lend a hand in revamping and rebranding&nbsp; 
            projects. <br>
            <br>
            This cynicism is a shame and perhaps wasteful because local 
            companies have done corporate identity campaigns in the past. Who is 
            to say that Oman’s local talent with its local roots would do a 
            worse job of communicating to local people? Why do companies in Oman 
            immediately suppose that an international company can do better when 
            creating an indentity? Isn’t it possible that local marketers could 
            create international campaigns that have more impact? Whatever the 
            answers to these soul-searching questions, the Sultanate’s local 
            marketing industry may rue these missed opportunities. Rebranding is 
            a huge global business. Brand consultants Landor Associates 
            estimates that the renaming market alone is worth over £1 billion 
            (RO650 million).<b><br>
            <br>
            It’s time to grow up<br>
            </b>Needless to say, the ad agencies are not the only companies that 
            may need to be given an urgent wake up call. Clients should, 
            evidently, rethink their strategy as well. “Many of <br>
            Oman’s companies are trying to gain international recognition but 
            without the marketing<br>
            budget that international players have. Worse, there is a lack of 
            willingness from the Board of Directors or owners of these companies 
            to invest time in a revamping or rebranding exercise that will not 
            affect the bottom line instantaneously,” says Haythem Macki, chief 
            executive of Fincorp.<br>
            <br>
            Riaan Muller, Client Manager for Landor Associates agrees. He tells 
            OER: “The discussion of revamping or rebranding always seems to 
            revolve around issues of cost which can misrepresent the nature of 
            the activity and the objective. All companies have an image that 
            they can either choose to manage for competitive advantage – or not. 
            Ultimately, as brands influence purchase behaviour and thereby 
            business results, brand management (including rebranding) is an 
            investment.”<br>
            <br>
            There are a myriad of fees and costs involved in a renaming or 
            rebranding programme – from legal fees for trademark searches, to 
            brand consultancy fees, to implementation costs. However, Muller 
            believes it’s important to keep an eye on the wider picture as 
            outlaying incremental costs for a rebranding programme may actually 
            create significant medium to long-term cost-savings.<b><br>
            </b><br>
            Macki of Fincorp is well aware of the costs and savings involved in 
            rebranding. Fincorp was created in May 2003 as an upshot of Oman’s 
            first tripartite merger wherein Al Mawarid Securities Co. SAOG 
            merged with Al Shalman Securities Co. SAOG, and the Investment 
            Banking Division of Oman &amp; Emirates Oman Securities. Although the 
            company emerged as the single largest investment banking operation 
            in Oman after the merger, it faced a tough rebranding challenge. 
            Rather than simply be perceived as a brokerage entity, Fincorp aims 
            to leverage itself as a far-more diversified outfit with a 
            competency to conduct corporate finance advisory services, asset 
            management and corporate research as well as brokerage services.<b><br>
            <br>
            Measuring the success of a campaign<br>
            </b>Success from revamping or rebranding can only be judged over 
            time. An instant snap assessment is inappropriate and likely to be 
            wrong. The results from the rebranding of BP Oman to Omanoil will 
            probably not be known for at least a year when OOMC can assess the 
            effect on the fuel volumes at filling stations assuming that one 
            believes there is brand loyalty in the local market. Early signs, 
            though, are encouraging. Phillips maintains: “We aim to conduct 
            further market research towards the end of the year once the entire 
            network has been rebranded for at least six months so that customers 
            have had the chance to experience the difference for themselves.”<br>
            <br>
            It’s also too early for Bank Dhofar to conduct research to evaluate 
            the perception of its revamped corporate identity. Shanfari echoes a 
            wish in future to measure the effectiveness of the marketing 
            campaign that had accompanied the change and the expectations that 
            have arisen out of the new commitment that the bank has been 
            communicating. But in addition, he says he believes that there are 
            many indicators to rate financial institutions and corporate 
            communications is just one of these. “Our business has much more to 
            it than corporate communications and marketing. I believe that our 
            performance in the past speaks very clearly as to what we are about 
            as a financial institution. We are financially very strong, we have 
            achieved consistent growth, and have had a steady and increasing 
            share price.” <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, having launched the new brand and gained that initial 
            burst of energy, Fincorp has begun conducting seminars for its 
            customers: Fund managers, institutions and high net worth 
            individuals. The events not only build further brand awareness, 
            trust, and customer loyalty but they also enable the company to gain 
            feedback on how well its rebranding has been perceived.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Departures from the norm</b><br>
            One company where a turnaround of fortunes has undeniably been 
            achieved from successful rebranding is that of Gulf Air. Certainly, 
            there has been more to this rebrand than changing corporate 
            graphics. Following James Hogan’s appointment as the airline’s head 
            honcho, one of his primary objectives has been to revitalise Gulf 
            Air – a brand that had been tarnished by years of cost cutting, poor 
            management and, most significantly, a recent crash that had killed 
            143 passengers. <br>
            <br>
            Undoubtedly, the brand has fused some positive stereotypes of the 
            region with a modern, contemporary international feel. Internally 
            the culture of the airline has also changed with the emphasis being 
            to adopt an innovative entrepreneurial attitude matched by a service 
            second to none: Chefs in First Class, the conception and launch of 
            the regions first all economy airline, Gulf Traveller and new 
            service concepts such as Business Plus, a ticket that acts as a 
            passport for on-ground transport, hotels and flights. To date, Gulf 
            Air’s debt mountain has been purged and there are realistic hopes 
            that the airline, in difficult trading conditions, can break even 
            later in 2004.<br>
            <br>
            “For any airline the livery is a key application that acts as a 
            signal of change. For Gulf Air it was fundamental to its ability to 
            prove that it was back in the game. The source of inspiration would 
            come from the Golden Falcon, both an important symbol of the 
            airline’s glory days of unrivalled service and of the power and 
            beauty of the Falcon, an unofficial symbol of the region,” notes 
            Muller of Landor Associates, the company appointed to revamp the 
            airline’s logo and livery.<b><br>
            </b><br>
            Recently, the new Gulf Air lounge at Bahrain’s Manama Airport 
            launched last month has become the latest vehicle to experience the 
            new Gulf Air brand delivering combined work and entertainment spaces 
            in an exquisite setting along with top quality hotel waiter service. 
            Proof that done properly, every piece of communication and every 
            idea within that piece of communication stacks with the brand 
            promise. For an airline, this is the sensory contact (the airline 
            lounge, the passenger jet, the menu, the food tray, and the inflight 
            magazine) as well as the human touch (ticket counters, uniforms, 
            frequent flyer programmes and offices). It’s also the informational 
            impact (websites, tickets, and advertising) to directional contact 
            (signage, billboards and terminals). As a result, every word of the 
            brand, and every voice of that expression, has essentially been 
            singing from the same branded songbook.<b><br>
            <br>
            The need for speed as well as consistency<br>
            </b>Speed is certainly an essential to most companies when they are 
            rolling out a new corporate identity. For OOMC, the speed to which 
            it has moved through its rebranding process has been important for 
            three main reasons. Phillips explains: “First, as soon as the BP 
            brand was no longer used, royalty payments ceased. Second, the 
            retail brand of Omanoil has different core values and aspirations to 
            BP and the sooner these can be endorsed through the new Omanoil 
            brand image across the country, the better. Third, for logistical 
            reasons, when running promotions or sponsoring events, we need to 
            use the new brand identity to reinforce the new&nbsp; image with a 
            clear consistent communication to the public.” <b><br>
            <br>
            </b>A word of warning, however. There is an acute danger of a 
            marketing campaign falling flat if it is rushed or launched 
            prematurely. “Planning the programme and letting it run its course 
            will make it almost impossible for a rebranding programme to fail - 
            especially in this region, where we are still in dire need for some 
            breakaway brands to stand their<br>
            ground against competitor foreign brands,” advises Muller.<br>
            <br>
            It isn’t a rebrand necessarily but the example of Oman Airports 
            Management Company (OAMC) is an interesting one. Since its 
            formation, the company has put the branding of the country’s 
            airports on ice because of the geopolitical climate in the region. 
            The green light to bring in a fully-fledged brand for the airports 
            in Seeb and Salalah could come within a year if the geopolitics 
            remains stable, reveals Colin Hobbs, chief executive of OAMC. Don’t 
            be surprised to see the airport names change and a distinct brand 
            identity materialise. In the meantime, the airports are making do 
            with the company’s initial corporate logo and the wordmark OAMC as a 
            visual identity. “It isn’t an ideal situation but when the time is 
            right our company will launch the new brand,” he confirms. <br>
            <br>
            There are other instances where companies have been slow to brand 
            build. In such cases, a company’s public standing can wane. Just 
            recall the lack of connection and dialogue that Oman 
            Telecommunications Company had before the Omantel logo and wordmark 
            became commonplace. The transformation came only recently in the 
            company’s history but not a day too soon considering the level of 
            competition it is expected to face as the<br>
            telecom sector opens up to increased competition beginning this 
            year.<br>
            <br>
            Earlier this year, Batelco, until recently the monopoly 
            telecommunications provider in Bahrain, unveiled its new corporate 
            identity in preparation for the arrival of its first competitor, MTC 
            Vodafone. The new Batelco logo carries the company name, and 
            underneath it two lines of waves, inspired by the five peaks on the 
            Bahrain national flag. The waves are also symbolic of the sea that 
            surrounds the islands and resemble an analogue speech wave, a 
            communications symbol that is synonymous around the world with human 
            speech. <br>
            <br>
            A day after it announced the new corporate identity, Batleco also 
            moved to make some changes to its product offering, specifically 
            cutting prices on both its pre-paid and contract services. Batelco 
            has also opened new retail sites in a concerted effort to get closer 
            to its customers.<br>
            <b><br>
            Lost in translation</b><br>
            Regrettably, without naming names, many companies in the region 
            could nurture their corporate identity better. They should remember 
            that brands do not belong to corporations but to people. Perhaps, 
            the easiest way to find out how others have depreciated their 
            branding power is by studying the flaws in the identities of those 
            that have revamped rather than rebranded.<br>
            <br>
            Let’s take Bank Dhofar’s new glyph and adage again. Officials at the 
            bank maintain it will help all stakeholders to better articulate 
            where the bank is from and where it plans to move in the future. 
            They could well be right. Firstly, the logo itself can connect more 
            easily to Arabs as well as non-Arabs. How well it does this is open 
            to debate but the intentions for more open communication are there 
            from the outset for all to see. <br>
            <br>
            This level of care to ensure inclusion demonstrated by Bank Dhofar 
            is impressive. Indeed, the positioning statement was also changed to 
            ‘Moving Forward...With You’ to take <br>
            into consideration much more than just banking. Shanfari claims: 
            “The earlier slogan ‘Adding Colour to Banking’ worked for the bank 
            in the past, but we wanted to emphasise the fact that we are moving 
            forward with all our stakeholders and that we are not only committed 
            to our relationships with our customers.” A businessman in the 
            market is less<br>
            impressed with the old slogan because it didn’t translate very well 
            into Arabic, saying: “The Arabic translation of the slogan meant the 
            bank was ‘painting banking’ and not as was probably intended by the 
            invention of it in English that it was adding vibrancy and character 
            to a bland banking landscape.” In fact, even in English the old 
            strapline could have caused cultural difficulties. Should the word&nbsp; 
            ‘colour’ have been spelt the US way or were English connotations 
            chosen on purpose? <br>
            <br>
            Notwithstanding, it would appear that corporate identities in Oman 
            and the wider region are increasingly becoming more culturally 
            relevant with bilingual personalities. They are thinking about the 
            implications of how their brands connect to people emotionally. This 
            has possibly allowed some multi-dimensional brands to become more 
            meaningfully felt and far more evocative communications to be 
            expressed.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Whose line is it anyway?</b><br>
            A slogan or strapline when carefully selected and used appropriately 
            can be important to any company, whether it be Omani or not. A 
            strapline should have attributes that leave the key brand message in 
            the minds of the target audience. It should be memorable, include 
            key benefits, differentiate the brand, help people recall the brand 
            name and&nbsp; impart positive feelings about the brand. <br>
            <br>
            Unlike Bank Dhofar which incorporated its tagline with its new-look, 
            Omanoil has chosen to wait awhile before using its slogan. “A 
            strapline has been chosen and will be used in the future once the 
            new logo is recognised throughout Oman,” counters Phillips. 
            “Initially, we wanted to create recognition with the Omanoil brand 
            corporate identity, the distinctive colours and simple modern image 
            of&nbsp; the new logo and associated wordmark without necessarily 
            complicating the message to the public.”<br>
            <br>
            As a general rule, Landor Associates advises not to use the slogan 
            in conjunction or close proximity to new or revitalised brand 
            identities. “We would not want to have a tagline or strapline 
            detract from a brand new look but it would depend on the brand,” 
            says Muller.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Young, gifted and... rebranded <br>
            </b>Oman’s new corporate logos that have been created in recent 
            times will, more often than not, appeal to young customers more than 
            old. It is very important they take the respective companies well 
            into the future. As Muller puts it, “There is a myriad of 
            stereotypical emblems or icons in Oman and other GCC countries. The 
            problem with these lie in the lack of differentiation, and the 
            strong visual link with the region which can limit<br>
            a brand aspiring to become more than just an Omani brand.”<br>
            <br>
            Traditional thinkers are used to seeing stereotypical icons and 
            emblems of Oman such as the khanjar and dhow among others. They feel 
            comfortable with them. They often like seeing them all fused 
            together to create a logo. But in doing so, they are less likely to 
            create a unique brand identity.<b><br>
            </b><br>
            “As much as it’s a comfort zone for the older generation, it’s not a 
            brand icon or identity that will stand out from the crowd in a 
            competitive marketplace. The younger generation knows this and we 
            often see this disconnect of generations with our clients. Only time 
            and more exposure to alternative, meaningful brand identities will 
            change attitudes,” says Muller. <br>
            <br>
            Today’s main marketing strategy in the GCC is to appeal to the young 
            because the consumers of tomorrow are today’s children. Demographics 
            in the region are uniquely different to other areas in the world and 
            it would be naive to ignore this fact. <br>
            <br>
            Logo appeal: A lesson in graphics <br>
            Ignoring all the other components that make up a brand identity 
            aside from a logo for a moment, it comes as no surprise that the 
            colours being used then are more appealing to youth and the Internet 
            generation. Blues in corporate logos are very popular around the 
            world and Oman has seen heavyweight institutions such as Omantel, 
            the Saud Bahwan Group and the Suhail Bahwan Group tow the line and 
            opt for a stable and solid corporate blue rather than a maverick 
            colour. “We have definitely seen quite a lot of sweeping curves 
            (seems even more so in Dubai) lately, but it would probably be too 
            much of a generalisation to call it a trend or being fashionable 
            currently,” remarks Muller.<br>
            <br>
            “Through the focus groups and one-to-one meetings with key 
            stakeholders, it became apparent to OOMC that Omanis wanted a local 
            company that was more in familiar with the local market and 
            associated with the younger, dynamic Omani population,” says 
            Phillips. <br>
            <br>
            Brand identities should represent and stand for more than the 
            obvious. Lately, Oman has seen many literal representations of 
            objects but the prediction is that we will see more abstract and 
            esoteric logos designed in the future as ideas from the country’s 
            younger generation come to the fore. <br>
            <br>
            Nevertheless, Naseem Javed, a renowned expert on corporate naming 
            issues, argues logos and big colour schemes are the things of the 
            past today. “In this e-commerce age, everyone is forced to type. No 
            one really cares about the logos or colours anymore, just the 
            names.”<br>
            <br>
            When it comes to changing a corporate identity, there is no recipe 
            for what works well and what does not. Brands must be able to stand 
            out in their market crowd. It has already been noted that Oman is an 
            economy where some companies starve brand development and ignore the 
            value that intangible assets have while others put a premium on 
            firmly establishing an image. As the market begins to throng with 
            foreign players with international brands, local companies will need 
            to pay heed. It is likely that merger and acquisition activity will 
            increase in the GCC and therefore brands in the region are set to 
            engage in more rebranding initiatives. More owners and/or directors 
            may also merely realise that it’s time for an overhaul.<br>
            <br>
            Clearly companies will need to decide (internally) if a rebranding 
            is needed and then stick to that action, argues Muller. “Many 
            companies go down the road of rebranding and then, halfway down the 
            road, backtrack on their plans or take an easy way out to either 
            save costs or for fear of the unknown or something different.”<br>
            <br>
            “If you need to spruce up your image and your brand identity because 
            your monopolistic market situation is changing, then you need to 
            have the guts and the courage to see the programme through – even if 
            it means that some situations may be unfamiliar or outside of your 
            comfort zone. You may also need to ask the question whether your 
            personal taste should come into place in light of who your consumers 
            are.” <br>
            <br>
            The truth, according to DNA Design, is that those companies with 
            fully customercentric brands that are being managed to optimise 
            brand interactions in a clever and compelling<br>
            manner will be tomorrow’s winners. Ditto that.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">After the sudden flare up in
the local markets during
the beginning of the year,
the MSM Index remained
relatively stabilised during
last month ending February 15, 2004.
In spite of retrenchment during the initial
fortnight period, the overall local
Index still showed signs of strength
and recouped - closing strongly at
297.09 points, a gain of 1.2 per cent on
a monthly basis. The trend was also
affected that the announcements of the
earnings season of companies which
ended their fiscal year 2003 in
December last year.<br>
<br>
Following are the list of stocks
which lost steam in the initial fortnight
but again recouped its losses and
ended in positive territory during the
over. This suggests that there is an
underlying strong positive sentiment
in the market. The overall volumes
also constantly maintained between
the RO2 million to RO3 million mark.
The overall advances to declines ratio
was at 1.65 with 48 stocks improving
during the period under review.
<br>
<br>
The banking and investment sector
held on to its gains during the
month by notching up a 0.7 per cent
gain - to cross its 400 level mark. This
was largely due to the better than
expected performance along with
their proposed dividend payouts as
against the expectations.<br>
<br>
BankMuscat has reported net profit
after tax of RO27.8 million, up from
RO22.9 million in 2002. Bank Dhofar
has reported RO10.1 million as against
RO8.3 million in 2002. National Bank of
Oman has reported net loss of RO51.8
million, as expected and hence it overall
stock stabilised. However, Oman
International Bank declared its net
profit at RO14.05 million, down from
RO 18.5 million in 2002.

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Also in the limelight was Alliance
Housing Bank which declared their
reported net profit of RO2.633 million
as against RO 1.8 million in 2002. ONIC
Holding reported a huge improvement
in its net profit, but largely on back of
investment gains. Its overall profits
touched RO7.25 million for the nine
months ended December 2003. Stocks
of brokerage companies like Fincorp
and GIS along with several holding
companies continued to be in demand.

The services sector was the top performer
for the past month, gaining the
highest by 4.6 per cent. The impressive
gainers were Oman Fisheries which
reported a strong performance for the
nine months ended December 2003. Its
overall profitability jumped from
RO393,000 to RO991,000. Other services
companies which declared their

results were oil marketing companies
like Oman Oil Marketing Co. (OOMC)
and Shell Oman Marketing (SOM).
While the stock price of SOM stabilised
in spite of a reduction in its
overall profits as the company maintained
its expected dividends, OOMC
saw it stock rising by more than 10 per
cent to touch RO3.890 as they
improved their net profit by 20 per
cent to touch RO2.6 million.
<br>
<br>

review to touch 216.87 points, losing
by 0.6 per cent. The largest losers for
the industrial sector has been National
Gas, Oman Chemicals, National
Pharmaceuticals, Oman Chlorine &amp;
Oman Flour Mills.<br>
<br>
However, specific stocks like Al Hassan Engineering, Cement &amp;
Gypsum Products and Al Fajar Al
Alamia continued to move up on high
volumes on value buying.</font></p>

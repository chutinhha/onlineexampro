                    government's oil revenue is based on an estimated price of 
                    $21 a barrel (2003 Budget: $20). Oman crude was traded at 
                    $29.75 a barrel in world market on January 6, 2004. Oil 
                    production is estimated at 710,000 barrels per day (bpd) 
                    during 2004 compared to 763,000 bpd budgeted in 2003. The 
                    budget oil production in 2004 reflects a decline of 22% 
                    against the Five-Year Plan estimate of 909,000 bpd. <br>
                    <br>
                    Any increase in oil revenue resulting from improved oil 
                    prices world be directed towards reducing the actual budget 
                    deficit. The contribution of oil revenue to total revenue is 
                    budgeted at 57% (2003 budget: 70%). The decline in oil 
                    contribution is on account of an expected fall in the level 
                    of daily production and the revenues budgeted in 2004 from 
                    LNG and oil condensates (RO415 million). <br>
                    <br>
                    The government is also planning to divest 30% of its equity 
                    in Oman Telecommunications Company SAOC (Omantel). The 
                    public issue of Al Maha Petroleum Company is also planned in 
                    2004. <br>
                    <br>
                    Expenditure of RO3,435 million shows an increase of 11% over 
                    the expected actual expenditure of 2003. <br>
                    <br>
                    Investment expenditure is estimated at RO912 million 
                    compared to RO614 million in 2003 budget. The 2004 
                    investment expenditure includes RO255 million budgeted on 
                    investments in LNG condensates and RO281 million on the 
                    government's share in PDO's capital expenditure (2003 
                    budget: RO241 million). <br>

                    <b>On the record <br>
                    HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, Minister of National Economy, 
                    speaks to Lakshmi Kothaneth after announcing the budget. 
                    Excerpts:</b> <br>
                    On GDP growth &quot;As you know, according to the results of 
                    Census 2003, we have to adjust our figures now and revise 
                    that affect on the GDP. If the oil price maintains its 
                    course today, of course GDP growth will be much better than 
                    expected.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>On a $21 barrel forecast for 2004 </b><br>
                    &quot;The conservative forecast for oil is $18 per barrel as has 
                    been applied in our Five-Year Plan. This has moved up by 20% 
                    based on prevailing market conditions. Oman also has to take 
                    into consideration the affect of prices on the resulting 
                    budget deficit at the end of the year. Bearing this in mind, 
                    the budget is neither overly conservative nor optimistic. It 
                    is reasonable.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>On the weakness of the $ </b><br>
                    &quot;The Omani rial is pegged with dollar and whenever there is 
                    erosion in the value of US dollar it will affect the Omani 
                    rial also. We have noticed an obvious impact on the price of 
                    goods imported into Oman from abroad.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>On Omantel privatisation</b><br>
&nbsp;&quot;The current status of the Omantel privatisation is that we are in the 
                    process of divest 30% of Omantel's equity. Officials are in 
                    the process of preparing the necessary documentation and 
                    finalising requirements needed to sell such shares in the 
                    market. The issue will happen shortly. I cannot say when but 
                    the intention is there.&quot; <br>
                    <b><br>
                    On planned state spending</b><br>
                    &quot;There are some important state-funded projects planned this 
                    year. For instance, there is the sewer plant planned in the 
                    Muscat area and the third LNG train in Sur. <br>
                    <br>
                    There is also the 90km Quriyat-Sur road, which is a major 
                    investment costing about RO56 million. Another important 
                    infrastructure project is the dual carriageway from Al 
                    Amerat to Quriyat. It may be in the order of RO24 million 
                    because it might cross a large wadi. Alternatively, we may 
                    need to cut a pass through a mountain. Studies are being 
                    conducted to find out which plan is the most cost-efficient. 
                    The government is considering financing the first phase of 
                    the express road from the Al Qurum roundabout to Bait Al 
                    Barka roundabout. It will become a very important relief 
                    road easing heavy traffic on the Sultan Qaboos Highway. The 
                    investment in this project is huge so we will start with a 
                    first stage of about RO12 million.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>On luring foreign investment </b><br>
                    &quot;It has been encouraging to see a lot of direct foreign 
                    investment flow into Oman. The Ministry of Commerce and 
                    Industry has taken several measures to facilitate this. Some 
                    mega-projects have been signed and many are in the pipeline 
                    but it is too early for us to talk about them. Our 
                    aspiration is also to observe the level of foreign 
                    investment in Muscat Securities Market. Our stock market is 
                    liberal and well regulated. Both Omanis and foreign 
                    investors have been taking advantage of this. I think the 
                    market has gained huge confidence in 2003 and I hope we will 
                    build further on this.&quot; </font></p>

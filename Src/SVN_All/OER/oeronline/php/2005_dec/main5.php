month of November, which is under review, was an important one. All the indices 
made significant lows in the last month (see table). Significantly, Omantel made 
a historic low of RO 1.77.<br>
<br>
Hence the question in investors’ mind is where do we go from here and what 
action should we take? Buy, sell or hold? To answer the questions of these 
investors, we have analyzed the market from a technical anlaysis perspective.<br>
<br>
Technical Analysis is a separate branch of study focusing mainly on the mass 
psychology for predicting the share price movements. Technical anlaysis uses the 
price charts as a frame of reference for identifying the mass psychology and it 
identifies the past price movements as a basis for predicting the future price 
movements. <br>
<br>
If we analyze the MSM 30 Index, we find that the bull market has commenced from 
January 2002. The first phase of the bull market lasted between January 2002 and 
July 2004. During this period, the index rose from 1500 levels to 3400 levels - 
giving a rise of approximately 1900 points. This was followed by a significant 
correction for six months which took place between July to December 2004. </font></p>

<img border="0" src="tab2.jpg" width="289" height="123"><br>
<img border="0" src="tab3.jpg" width="286" height="119"></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The index was more or 
less stagnant between around 3300 level during this period. The second phase of 
the bull market commenced from January this year and the index rose steeply from 
3300 to 5700 in a span of just six months. A correction has started from June 
and it is in progress now.<br>
<br>
The index has completed the first and second phase of the bull market and there 
is likely to be one more phase left. During this third phase, the index will 
probably cross the previous high or is likely to go very close to the previous 
high.<br>
<br>
What is going on now in the market is the counter-trend to the second phase. It 
is normally difficult to predict the duration of such counter trends. Based on 
technical analysis, we may conclude that the counter trend may be at the final 
stages or it may take a couple of more months to complete. <br>
<br>
<b>Recommendation</b><br>
The downside risk from the current levels, on the basis of technical analysis, 
is not very high and the index may drop by another 5 to 10 per cent. Hence we 
advise investors to take advantage of the reliability of technical tools and to 
enter into good stocks at the current levels and hold them till the completion 
of the third phase of the bull market.</font></p>

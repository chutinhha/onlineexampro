            China revalued its currency the Yuan after almost a decade. It was 
            considered common logic that an economy growing at 9 per cent cannot 
            keep such an artificial control of the currency for too long. 
            Beijing’s move from a Dollar peg to a basket of currencies was 
            widely expected. The Asian giant has gone for a deceptively smaller 
            currency revaluation – at 2.1 per cent. But since the plunge has 
            been taken after a gap of ten years, more such small measures could 
            well be on the cards. </font></p>

            <b>Oman gets Arab World Economic Freedom Award</b><br>
            The Sultanate of Oman became the joint winner of the first `Overall 
            Arab Economic Freedom Award 2005', signifying the strong economic 
            fundamentals, which have put the country on a glorious development 
            pedestal. Oman bagged one more award, the `Sound Money Award' for 
            access to sound money. This award measures, among other parameters, 
            the average annual growth of the money supply in the last five years 
            minus the average annual growth of real GDP in the last ten years. 
            The Arab Economic Freedom Awards, a total of six in all, based on 
            the Fraser Institute Economic Freedom Index, are given to 
            governments from across the Arab world in recognition of their 
            achievements in the creation of wealth through the promotion of 
            economic freedom. With regards to freedom of economies, a Canadian 
            institute declared in its annual report the Sultanate as one of the 
            top 20 countries on the international level. Within the Arab 
            countries level, the Sultanate secured the second position after the 
            UAE, based on statistical information on the 2003 economy 
            performances. The index is formed by five main factors namely the 
            volume of the public sector, the country’s legal set up, ownership 
            rights, monitory supply, commercial inter-trade freedom and loans, 
            manpower and business organisation. It is worth-mentioning that Hong 
            Kong topped the international list followed by New Zealand.</font></p>

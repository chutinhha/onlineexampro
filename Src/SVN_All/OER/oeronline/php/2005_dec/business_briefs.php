                    eliminate tariffs and barriers and expand trade between both

                    contribute to economic growth and trade between both

                    <br>
                    The agreement will generate export opportunities for US 
                    companies, farmers, and ranchers, help create jobs in the 
                    United States, and help American consumers save money while 
                    offering them greater choices. In addition to eliminating 
                    its tariffs on US products, Oman will provide substantial 
                    market access across its entire services regime, provide a 
                    secure, predictable legal framework for US investors

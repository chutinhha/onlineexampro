blog culture in Oman, and going by the response his blog site generates, he may 
have already set the process in motion. Mehre Alam tries to find out why, and 
how<br>
</b><br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>S</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ummer 
of 2004. Osamah M. Abdullatif and his wife are in Glasgow to complete their 
post-graduate degrees. They are on course but find something amiss. What is 
that? They finally get the answer. It’s a strong feeling, a burning desire to 
find a venue for self-expression. And that’s how Osamah decides to start a blog. 
An idea is born!<br>
<br>
The couple returns to Oman but Osamah’s passion for the blog continues unfazed. 
Finally his zeal takes a concrete shape. The blog site, http://muscati.blogspot.com, 
is born. “One of the initial reasons I started the blog was to promote a blog 
culture among Oman’s netizens,” says Osamah. </font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="marketing1.jpg" width="200" height="188"></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Blogs, says Osamah, have become 
a credible news outlet, especially in countries that do not have an effective 
media. “I was fascinated by some regional bloggers, especially in Bahrain, 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. By reading their blogs, I found a new perspective about 
those countries. I hope that Omani blogs eventually mature to the point of being 
an equivalent perspective from Oman.”<br>
<br>
However, unlike some other more prolific bloggers, they do not post every day. 
In fact over the past year and a half, they have posted approximately 250 times. 
The topics range from personal experiences, sharing things they like, posting 
pictures, to the occasional serious topic or analysis pieces. “We try to steer 
away from being too serious, except when warranted, and we never write about our 
work or anything that is connected with our day-to-day jobs,” explains Osamah.<br>
<br>
They do not use their names on the blog but they are not anonymous and quite a 
few people know who they are. “I suppose the lack of anonymity does have an 
effect on what we write. It makes you think twice before you write anything. 
It’s much easier for people who write before a blanket of anonymity,” says 
Osamah.<br>
<br>
The blog is getting popular day by day. The blog’s statistics show it. It 
receives an average of 250 to 300 views a day of which over a third are unique 
visitors and about 50 are repeat visitors. “Nothing earth-shattering, but quite 
surprising to see so many people interested to read what you write on a daily 
basis,” asserts Osamah.<br>
<br>
And, thanks to the large increase in the number of Omani blogs over the past 
year, three Omani bloggers got together and decided to launch the Omani Blog 
Awards to choose the best Omani blog for the year. The process is still in the 
nomination stage and the winner should be announced by the year’s end. <br>
<br>
“One can find a link to the awards’ website on my blog. Any Omani who has a blog 
that has at least 20 posts is eligible for nomination. Blogs owned and 
maintained by non-Omanis are also eligible so long as they blog from or about 
Oman,” informs Osamah. And, what about the links? Responds Osamah: “Visit my 
blog.” He recommends Mahmood’s Den from Bahrain, Saudi Jeans from Saudi Arabia, 
and Kuwait Unplugged from Kuwait.</font></p>

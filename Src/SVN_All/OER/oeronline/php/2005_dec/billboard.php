                    The steady ascent of Oman Air as a world-class airline has 
                    reflected the growth of Oman as a major air traffic hub in 
                    the Middle East. As the flagship company of the civil 
                    aviation sector of the Sultanate of Oman, Oman Air has also 
                    played a key role in powering this growth.<br>
                    <br>
                    To reflect its growing prominence as a strong regional 
                    player and the emergence of the brand as the airline of 
                    choice among travellers in the highly competitive Middle 
                    East sector, Oman Air has recently initiated a corporate 
                    advertising campaign aimed primarily at audiences in Oman 
                    and across the GCC.<br>
                    <br>
                    The campaign is based around young children as the central 
                    characters. “Our strategy is to emphasise the fact that the 
                    Oman Air brand stands for care and hospitality with a 
                    personal touch. The universal appeal of children fits 
                    perfectly into this line of thought,” said Mohammed Al 
                    Shikely Senior Manager - Marketing at Oman Air. “Moreover,” 
                    he continued, “our aim was to highlight our specific core 
                    propositions at the same time as the softer aspects.”<br>
                    <br>
                    The strategy seems to have succeeded, as the first series of 
                    advertisements have already generated considerable interest 
                    among audiences in Oman and beyond. “The initial feedback we 
                    have collected corroborates that the campaign has been 
                    extremely well received by potential customers, and the 
                    public in general. There is improved brand awareness and 
                    recall. This is good news as we strive to continuously and 
                    eagerly reaffirm our commitment to make flying with Oman Air 
                    even more rewarding for our customers,” said Mohammed Al 
                    Shikely.<br>
                    <br>
                    Over the years, the airline has continuously charted newer 
                    levels of customer service with several investments in 
                    state-of-the-art technologies and engineering upgradations 
                    to its young fleet. In fact, Oman Air is only the second 
                    airline in the entire Middle East to offer the convenience 
                    of e-ticketing. And e-ticketing itself is only the first of 
                    a whole host of such facilities that will soon be unveiled 
                    and offered to Oman Air customers.<br>
                    <br>
                    Today, Oman Air has carved a niche of its own in the 
                    regional and international sectors with its renowned 
                    tradition of hospitality, thorough professionalism, 
                    extensive air network, convenient connectivity, enviable 
                    on-time performance and excellent safety record. The 
                    advertising campaign is yet another sign that Oman’s 
                    favourite airline is well on the way to becoming the airline 
                    of choice for travellers who expect more when they fly.</span></font></p>

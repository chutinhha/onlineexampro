Time to blog<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#FF0000"><br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Four years ago, blogging was a little-known 
pastime practised only by computer geeks. The idea was to make interactive 
journals available on the Internet that anyone, anywhere with a computer could 
access. Since then, the blogging trend has grown explosively. It is estimated 
40,000 of these online journals are created each day and they cover everything 
from industrial estate to climate change to the latest in Latino style, 
products, entertainment and culture and everything in between. Believe it or 
not, there are over 16 million blogs in existence.<br>
<br>
Simply put, blog is a series of updated posts on a web page in the form of a 
diary or journal, often including commentary on, and hypertext links to, other 
websites. Additions to the blog are posted in chronological order and can 
contain anything from simple text, to music, images and even streamed video.<br>
<br>
For corporates across the globe, blogs are quickly becoming the new darlings of 
interactive marketing – firms have discovered that blogs support branding and 
customer communications, create awareness and customer loyalty. Moreover, it 
offers firms an additional opportunity to sell their product or service. But how 
many Oman-based organizations are benefiting from a corporate blog? <br>
<br>
Apart from the newly-launched PEIE Mirror (http://peie.blogspot.com), a blog 
from the Public Establishment for Industrial Estates, there seem to be few Omani 
organizations tapping into the potential of blogging. In fact, there are obvious 
sectors in the Omani economy that should be developing blogs. If they did, they 
would be reaping rich rewards. <br>
<br>
<b>Radio, TV &amp; Cinema </b><br>
Oman’s radio, TV and cinema businesses are still relatively young and all rely 
on three forms of marketing: advertising, public relations and word-of-mouth. 
The latter has been the most important for all three and has contributed to the 
organic growth we're seeing in these industries. However, none of them have 
blogs and that's surprising. <br>
<br>
For cinema owners, a blog would be a great way to promote upcoming releases and 
little-known movies that are finding an audience. Radio could use blogs to 
promote programs, new music releases, events and a DJ culture. TV could use a 
blog as a marketing device to help push television scheduling on behalf of 
advertisers. The news flow in these industries is steady and blogs would be a 
great opportunity to get that information out to a growing youthful, educated 
and tech savvy Omani audience. Radio, TV and cinema are three key and important 
creative sectors and I’m surprised they haven’t embraced a cheap, interactive 
and non-resource-intensive marketing device like blogs. </font></p>

<b>Supermarkets </b><br>
Contrary to popular belief, supermarkets make us richer. They’re hugely 
efficient, forcing down costs. Groceries (clothes and household goods) are today 
much cheaper than in the pre-supermarket era 20 years ago. That leaves us more 
money to spend on the things we value. Supermarkets enrich our choice too. The 
shelves groan with fruit and vegetables that were unknown 25 years ago - or 
unavailable when they were out of season. Supermarket shopping is big business, 
but why no blogs?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For example, a food smart blog with food-related news, views and advice would be 
a good way to attract and retain customers. There could be a Q&amp;A section where 
folk ask a local chef associated with the supermarket questions on everything 
from health food to preparing a dinner party for 10. Extend this idea to include 
news about slashing your weekly food bill, cheap and easy recipes, menu planning 
ideas, shopping hints and you have a destination for food lovers, and a way to 
extend your brand and increase sales. This isn’t rocket science and in fact I 
have to say how surprised I am that apart from Marks and Spencer’s and ToysRus, 
I receive no e-mail or text contact from the&nbsp; supermarkets and larger 
stores my family and I spend our cash in. Most seem to rely on the fliers they 
put under my gate. Maybe they need to master a few Net basics before <br>
they blog?<br>

<b>Stock Brokers </b><br>
Interest in stocks and shares and the Muscat Securities Market has boomed over 
the past few years. Oman-based investors need professional advice. Indeed, the 
vast majority still rely on word-of-mouth recommendations and full or partial 
service brokers to execute trades, provide guidance and research. <br>
<br>
Stock brokers could easily launch a simple blog that tracks daily market-moving 
events, highlights research and helps investors understand the in and outs of 
stock market investing. A more informed investor is more profitable than his 
uninformed counterpart. A blog can help turn those not so well briefed investors 
into better customers, right? <br>

<b>Travel</b> <br>
Today, most folk are members of frequent flier programs. But how often does your 
airline of preference talk to you? And when they do, what are they selling you? 
That’s right, knock down fares at times of the year when you either can’t or 
don’t want to travel! Let’s face it, they could be communicating a whole lot 
more often as well as whetting our appetite with news on locations, car hire, 
restaurant and hotel recommendations, sightseeing tips, airline regulations and 
flight specials would all be a hit. I’d like to see airlines humanize the travel 
experience. This would certainly foster goodwill with passengers.<br>

<br>
<b>Education</b> <br>
Individual departments and university lectures have blogs, but I haven’t been 
able to track down an Oman-based college or university with a blog of its own.
<br>
<br>
Oman’s higher education sector is booming and colleges are competing each year 
to attract the best students. So how can colleges talk to prospective students 
as well as mums and dads? Blogs. Most colleges run a website, but these tow an 
official and fairly dry line. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, a blog with information about the college, one that could 
include news about its great business or IT departments, and student life issues 
would spice things up and give prospective students a reason to keep checking in 
with the college during the decision-making process. A blog would also provide 
current students with information on campus events, workshops, seminars, career 
fairs, deadlines for course enrolment and other relevant news. Let students have 
a separate voice and use blogs as a way to bring information directly to current 
and prospective students in a straightforward fashion. <br>

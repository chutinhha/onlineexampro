                    strides in the insurance arena since its launch in Oman last 
                    September. Initially, OQIC concentrated on building up the 
                    brand, establishing relationships with major brokers and 
                    corporate entities, participating in government tenders and 
                    looking at other opportunities to develop a platform for 
                    growth. Many of these objectives were achieved as well as 
                    securing some tender business and taking over the insurances 
                    of a number of major corporate clients. <br>
                    <br>
                    OQIC has now established fully operational departments for 
                    underwriting, claims, accounts staffed with technically 
                    qualified, experienced professionals who are committed to 
                    provide customer service of the highest possible order. <br>
                    <br>
                    OQIC management, in its endeavors to develop employee 
                    skills, has drawn up an action plan to educate and train all 
                    of their employees, with full recognition and emphasis upon 
                    Omanisation initiatives. We honor the Omanisation program 
                    and are proud to confirm that we have exceeded our targeted 
                    ratios. As OQIC grows, it will place emphasis upon local 
                    recruitment, assuring prospective staff of proper guidance, 
                    good working environment, and the opportunity to attend

                    that were becoming increasingly critical to the operations

                    a centralised source of information and guidance in the 
                    field. In 1969, the group formalised, incorporating as the 
                    EDP Auditors Association. In 1976 the association formed an 
                    education foundation to undertake large-scale research

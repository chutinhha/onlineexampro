            Peugeot’s 407 has been attracting attention ever since its launch 
            last September with its elegance, technological content and great 
            performance. Not to rest on the laurels, Peugeot has just launched 
            the 407 SW, which draws heavily from the ‘genetic wealth’ shared 
            with the former version while offering different benefits that gives 
            it originality. Innovative, bright, user-friendly and practical, the 
            407 SW offers space and refinement, dynamism and safety.<br>
            <br>
            Elegance and dynamism are the common features of the 407 saloon and 
            407 SW. The 407 SW’s overall length has been increased to 4.763 m 
            while the overall height has been increased by 41 mm. One of the 
            special features of the SW is its panoramic glass roof. Manufactured 
            from tinted laminated glass with a thickness of 6 mm, the glass roof 
            delivers a light transmittance in the order of 20 per cent. <br>
            <br>
            Anti-glare interior rear-view mirror incorporating the 
            latest-generation electro chrome technology makes nighttime rear 
            vision even more comfortable by automatically darkening if 
            necessary. Check out the 407 SW to find out more about the newest 
            car in town.</font></p>

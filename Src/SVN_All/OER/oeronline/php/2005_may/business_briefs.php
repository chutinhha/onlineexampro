                    Michael Kutschenreuter, Chief Financial Officer of Siemens 
                    Communications, visited the Sultanate recently. Excerpts

                    to Oman, Michael. What brings you here, and is this your 
                    first visit to the country?</b><br>
                    Thank you. No, it isn’t my first visit t Oman – I have been 
                    a regular visitor to the Sultanate, and come here at least 
                    once or twice every year to discuss company matters and 
                    relations. I simply love this country and the people. My 
                    visit precedes German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s visit to 
                    the country.<br>
                    <br>
                    At Siemens, we have a strong commitment with to the 
                    Sultanate. We have nurtured strong and lasting relations 
                    with Oman Telecommunications Company (Omantel) and Oman 
                    Mobile through our joint projects. One of our latest 
                    projects is the broadband project – an important project for 
                    Oman as it allows Omantel to provide broadband services for 
                    schools, cyber cafés, leading corporates, hotels, houses and 
                    other places.<br>

                    <b>What are the challenges that multinational 
                    telecommunications companies like Siemens face here in Oman?</b><br>
                    Omantel and Oman Mobile are well– organised companies with 
                    skilful staff. Identifying customer trends is a great 
                    challenge – not only in Oman, but anywhere in the world. We 
                    must know the customer’s needs and fulfil them before they 
                    change.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Will the topography of Oman be an obstacle for expanding 
                    telecommunications network?</b><br>
                    I do not consider that a serious problem. It can be done 
                    easily using the latest equipment. For many years Siemens 
                    has been deploying, successfully, telecommunication 
                    infrastructure .<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What do you think is a right time to privatise?</b><br>
                    Privatisation must happen at a time when investors are ready 
                    for it so as to ensure success and a smooth transition. This 
                    is the way it has happened in many countries in Europe and 
                    other places in the world. It will be useful to learn from 
                    their experiences but it will be more useful to learn from 
                    the experience of the non-successful privatisation projects 
                    around the world. In Oman, privatisation is bound to be 
                    successful as a sound telecommunications infrastructure is 
                    in place and work is well-organised. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Is the number of telecom firms in Oman sufficient for the 
                    market?</b><br>
                    The number of subscribers is increasing every day, and the 
                    telecommunications industry is evolving rapidly. Many 
                    additional services are being created. A solid competition 
                    will allow more services to be offered at reasonable and 
                    competitive prices.<br>
                    <br>
                    One new service is the Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line 
                    (ADSL), which is like a gateway for future technology. 
                    Through this service, new services such as high speed 
                    Internet, online gaming and video-on-demand are possible. I 
                    am optimistic regarding the popularity of ADSL in the 
                    Sultanate – I know that there are only around 54,000 
                    Internet subscribers in the country, but I am quite 
                    confident that this number will grow in the future.</font></p>

                    Ahlia Detergent bags $8.5 million Iraq contract<br>
                    </b><br>
                    Iraq’s Ministry of Trade has awarded a contract worth $8.5 
                    million (RO3.27 million) to supply detergent powder to 
                    Oman’s Al Ahlia Detergent Company. “It’s a good recognition 
                    and an honour to the country’s consumer goods industry. At 
                    present, we export more than 70 per cent of our production. 
                    We have been associated with the Iraqi market since 1999. 
                    Lately, we had executed a contract worth half a million 
                    dollar in Iraq. The new contract, which is significantly 
                    greater than the previous contracts from Iraq, is expected 
                    to substantially improve the performance of the company 
                    during the current year,’’ said Al Ahlia Detergent Company 
                    Chairman Tawfeeq A. Al Lawati. <br>
                    <br>
                    Al Ahlia Detergent Company hopes to increase its popularity 
                    despite aggressive competition from hypermarkets. The 
                    company’s exports declined last year, mainly due to the 
                    stiff competition from international brands and the rising 
                    prices of raw materials. Since 1999, the company had been 
                    making profits, but in 2004, it incurred a net loss of 
                    RO262,364 as against a net profit of RO106,867 in 2003 and 
                    pects to make profits in 2005. j12Al Ahlia Detergent Company

                    appoint Turner Construction as the Project and Construction 
                    Managers for The Wave. Their experience and expertise in

                    Sohar Aluminium is expected to contribute more than two per 
                    cent to Oman’s GDP after start up, according to the 
                    company’s CEO. The project will have significant 
                    socio-economic benefits for the Sultanate, notably in the 
                    area of employment generation, said Anthony Kinsman. <br>
                    <br>
                    Initially, 35 per cent of the estimated 1,000 direct jobs 
                    will be set aside for Omanis, the figure is expected to rise 
                    to 60 per cent of the workforce after five years. Besides, 
                    the project will help in the creation of some 4,000 indirect 
                    jobs. During the construction phase an estimated 5,000-6,000 
                    jobs will be created with a target local content of 35 per 
                    cent. <br>

                    Irish firm bags offshore oilfield </b><br>
                    Ireland’s Circle Oil has bagged a major offshore oil 
                    exploration block in Oman with large reserves potential. 
                    Block 49 has been awarded to Circle Oil by the government 
                    for a six-year period. Situated in the southwest of Oman, 
                    the Block covers an area of over 15,400 square kilometers. 
                    Block 49 extends north to the Saudi Arabian border across 
                    which is located the Rub Al Khali oil basin. The first 
                    exploration period runs for 36 months followed by two 
                    18-month periods. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the first period reviewing of existing data and 
                    aero-gravity with 2D and 3D seismic surveying has been 
                    agreed upon. Major drilling and seismic surveying will be 
                    carried out during the two additional 18-month periods, 
                    reports revealed. As sources put it, the production sharing 
                    agreement includes all aspects of the exploration, 
                    development and production phases. <br>
                    <br>
                    “It gives the company significant exposure in a major oil 
                    producing country where almost all of the exploration and 
                    production areas are held by the larger oil companies. This 
                    acquisition further demonstrates the ability of Circle Oil’s 
                    technical team to secure quality acreage in one of the 
                    world’s main production areas,” said David Hough, chief 
                    executive of Circle Oil plc.<br>
                    <br>
                    Circle Oil is involved in oil and gas exploration, 
                    development and production. The company operates in Namibia 
                    through its wholly owned subsidiary First African Oil 
                    Corporation. In Ireland it is actively engaged in 
                    negotiations to acquire other acreage.</font></p>

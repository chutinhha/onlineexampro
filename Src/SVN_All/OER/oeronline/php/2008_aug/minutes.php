</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<b>Antti Arponen, CEO, Friendi Mobile, who has nearly 12 years of international 
experience in the telecommunications field, speaks to Visvas Paul D Karra of OER 
about global trends which are contributing to an exciting mobile telephony 
market</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="min.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="200" height="221">Towards the end of June, the Telecom Regulatory Authority granted Class II 
licences to five companies as resellers of basic mobile services in the 
Sultanate. Of these five, Friendi Mobile has been the first to announce its 
services. The opening up of the mobile telephony market means it is boom time 
for customers as they will have numerous choices and many alternatives, says 
Antti Arponen, CEO, Friendi Mobile.<br>
<br>
“The Sultanate has an excellent telecom infrastructure. Now you just need to 
provide enough alternatives for the consumer. In Oman there are now only two 
providers, I think the correct number should be many more. I am not saying this 
from a competitive perspective but I am just thinking that a customer needs to 
have more options,” says Arponen.<br>
<br>
Expectations are always high from a new mobile service provider but Arponen has 
hinted that Friendi Mobile has a few aces in its SIM card. Price is the 
uppermost thing on most people’s mind but Arponen thinks otherwise. “People say 
prices will be lowered but we say that it needs to be more relevant. You don’t 
pay for things you don’t need. Pricing is important and, yes, it should be lower 
for the elements you need but it does not mean that a new mobile provider will 
slash all the prices because that is not even beneficial for the consumers.”<br>
<br>
Friendi Mobile is also planning to reach out to customers who actually don’t 
have a mobile subscription. “These people expect certain things. We have 
interviewed a lot of them and know their needs. We definitely have an attractive 
package for them. And also, we need to be where the consumer is,” informs 
Arponen.<br>
<br>
<b>Industry veteran</b><br>
With a mobile technology and a business management degree in hand, Arponen has 
helped mobile telephone companies in establishing operations in North America, 
Asia and Europe. Peronsally, he has been in 12 different countries. Presently, 
Friendi Mobile is in the process of setting up operations in 16 Middle East and 
North Africa countries and Oman is the first of the lot. On the technical 
quality of Friendi’s coverage in Oman, he discloses that Friendi Mobile has been 
busy since the past two years, setting up a technology that is being currently 
used by 130 million customers worldwide, so it’s “battle-proven” high quality.<br>
<br>
“We will introduce many things in Oman. For me personally it will be interesting 
and good fun to see how this market develops in the next two years,” says 
Arponen, who prefers to call himself as a person who introduces something that 
consumers appreciate everyday, of course in a financial okay manner. According 
to him, usability and simplicity are two ways in which a mobile company can make 
itself attractive. It is more about usability and less about technology which is 
constantly changing.<br>
<br>
A product also has to be easily available to a customer. The other element is 
the pricing which has to be simple enough to let the customer know what he is 
going to get. And moreover, a mobile service provider needs to have customer 
service that can solve problems without a customer having to go to a physical 
outlet.<br>
<br>
Friendi is following a successful business model known as Mobile Virtual Network 
Operator (MVNO) in all the countries except Oman. The MVNO model is quite 
clearly an international trend. First there is a monopoly when they build the 
first network. Then in the next phase, they build another or even a third 
network and that has happened in Oman as well. This is capacity building. Then 
the third phase is where companies like Friendi enter bringing more options and 
more choices for the consumer. The technology is working; there is enough 
capacity and now what one needs are the options.<br>
<br>
Arponen further explains: “In countries like Netherlands, the banks are MVNOs 
themselves. Obviously there are the big operators who own the network 
infrastructure in Netherlands, Germany and in most countries in Europe. These 
biggies realise that they don’t have the resources to create a small theme for 
every small segment. So they open the network to other providers so you can go 
and serve your football club or anyone else. It is extremely exciting for the 
consumers and it is extremely exciting for the network operators.. They have the 
major customer base and for the smaller parts they use somebody else.”<br>
<br>
The lanky Arponen, a national of Finland, has lived and worked in London, 
Finland and just before coming to Oman, in Amsterdam over a period of 12 years 
during which time he was involved in establishing and managing mobile services 
for consumers in highly competitive markets.<br>
<br>
The Netherlands, says Arponen, is an advanced market because although The 
Netherlands is a fairly small European country it has an estimated 60 mobile 
service providers. In that country, the banks are mobile service providers 
themselves; the football clubs have something for them; then there are certain 
services for the kids. There is yet another mobile service provider, whose 
profits go to a charity in Africa. Phew! <br>
<br>
<b>Constant change</b><br>
Speaking about other innovative changes in the telecom industry, Arponen says: 
“I think most people would say that the changes have come in the features, 
technology, services and so on, but for me the biggest change is when people 
understand that even though a mobile phone or prepaid card is a high tech 
product, it needs to be simple and it needs to work. Nobody considers an aspirin 
as a high tech product but actually it is. In the past 10 years the mobile 
industry has changed from engineering to consumer understanding.” Arponen also 
feels that simplicity can take many different forms and usability.<br>
<br>
“In some markets you can just go and buy a SIM card from a vending machine. In 
Oman, mobile telephony is still in the phase where you need to think about 
whether to make a call in the morning, evening or in the weekends. On the other 
extreme in some countries, and I am not saying it will necessary happen in Oman, 
there is a facility where you pay a certain amount and eat all you can and not 
worry about anything. It is as simple as that and I think that is the major 
development,” Arponen points out.<br>
<br>
In Arponen’s personal opinion, the innovations come in usability. Earlier, if 
you wanted to acquire a mobile phone service, you had to apply for a 
subscription, then wait for it. Usability is not about how to use a SIM card. It 
starts from an advertisement which clearly. The next stage is where you are 
going to buy it from. It must be from a place near you, not 200 kms away.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Middle East, particularly the Gulf region, is a high growth 
region for the mobile telephony and Friendi has walked in with the promise of a 
new experience.<br>

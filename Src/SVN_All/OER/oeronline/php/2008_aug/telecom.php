rest assured about better pricing and service coming their way in future, 
reports Mayank Singh</b><br>
<br>
Walk into any conference hall or a business meeting and one is sure to see a 
number of BlackBerry smart phones on the table. One cannot fault customers 
wishing to brandish their BlackBerry’s as the device has acquired an iconic 
status worldwide. Oprah Winfrey, Naomi Campbell and Christina Aguilera are among 
a growing list of celebrities who have been hooked on to these smart phones. The 
growth of the BlackBerry market in Oman since Oman Mobile Telecommunications 
introduced the service in December 2007 has been nothing less than spectacular. 
In a short span of eight months over 200 corporations have started using the 
service. These include some of the biggest names in industry like Petroleum 
Development Oman (PDO), Oman Air, Bank Dhofar, BankMuscat, General Automotive 
Company, Oman Shipping Company, Assarain Enterprises and so on. Says Mostafa 
Ahmed Kombor, Corporate Sales Manager, Marketing and Sales Division, “this was 
possible because we were able to convince our corporate customers that the 
service added great value to their business.”</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<br>
<b>Two to tango</b><br>
<img border="0" src="tel2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="266" height="335">Sensing the potential in the market Nawras launched its BlackBerry Service on 
June 21, 2008. Nawras, though, has had Blackberry users on its network since it 
introduced data roaming back in 2005. The entry of the second mobile operator is 
expected to give a huge boost to the BlackBerry market. Says Ross Cormack, CEO, 
Nawras, “We have proved that the competition is good for the market as we have 
seen mobile penetration go up from 32 per cent when we entered the market to 
almost 100 per cent today.”<br>
<br>
The two players are already rolling out the red carpet for customers. In order 
to make the Blackberry service more accessible and economical to business 
customers, Oman Mobile has introduced three different packages to suit different 
lifestyle and business needs – BlackBerry Lite, BlackBerry Unlimited Local, and 
BlackBerry Unlimited International. The BlackBerry Lite package offers a three 
MB usage at a cost of RO9.900 per month. The BlackBerry Unlimited Local gives 
subscribers the choice of unlimited local usage for a fixed monthly rate of 
RO18.500. The BlackBerry International package targets people who travel 
frequently and are interested in remaining connected while roaming. This service 
is available for a monthly fee of RO29.500 with unlimited national and 
international usage on BlackBerry APN.<br>
<br>
Says Kombor, “These plans give subscribers the flexibility of choosing what 
suits them best. And since customers are at the heart of our mobile services, we 
continue to empower them with state-of-the-art services, a variety of choices, 
and exclusive benefits.”<br>
<br>
Nawras has introduced with two subscription plans for Blackberry. One a national 
plan with 20MB free for only RO19 per month and a global plan with unlimited 
local data and free three MB of international roaming data for only RO29 per 
month. The company has also worked out segmentation based on the individual 
needs. Thus there is a BlackBerry Internet Solution for individual subscribers, 
SoHo (small office home office) and SME business. Second, there is a BlackBerry 
Enterprise Solution for corporate and BlackBerry Enterprise Solution Plus for 
corporates who want the best of the two service plans. Says Cormack, “We did not 
want to bring in a device but a service to the market so we looked at how people 
were using BlackBerrys and worked out solutions accordingly.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="tel3.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="276" height="365">Nawras has also been playing up its value added services that are available to 
it’s subscribers. Thus by paying a six month subscription of RO19 a customer can 
avail of WorldMate live Professional Travel organiser. The organiser allows 
subscribers to get travel related information like flight schedules, hotel 
bookings etc. BlackBerry Enterprise Solution Subscribers receive value adds like 
Holy Quran, Instant Messenger Plus, Financial Times News Reader, stock ticker 
and Viigo RSS Reader which gives news updates, weather reports, entertainment 
and sports news.<br>
<br>
<b>Taking off</b><br>
Being the leading operator, Oman Mobile has acquired definite first mover 
advantage in the market. For example starting with three BlackBerry handsets in 
December 2007, the mobile service provider now offers subscribers seven devices 
to choose from. These include – the 8700g, Pearl 8100, Pearl 8120, Curve 8310, 
Curve 8320, 8800 and 8820. The price range starts from RO199 and goes upto 
RO279. Compared to this Nawras offers four handsets – the Pearl 8100, Pearl 
8110, Curve 8310 and 8820. The entry level Pearl 8100 is priced at RO199 while 
the top end 8820 comes at RO279.<br>
<br>
Oman Mobile is quick to point out that its 1800 GSM stations cover 95 per cent 
of the population in the Sultanate. Its coverage also includes international 
data roaming in 49 countries through its 91 partner operators. Nawras feels that 
its EDGE platform provides for better connectivity and its 100 partners in 60 
countries gives BlackBerry subscribers more choices. As claims and counter 
claims fly around it is the customer who is going to be the final arbiter.<br>
<br>
Catering to the high end of the market presents its own set of challenges like 
living upto the expectations of a demanding audience. Aware of this Oman Mobile 
and Nawras are working overtime on providing subscribers with best-in-class 
service. For instance, Oman Mobile has introduced a dedicated call centre for 
BlackBerry subscribers. So instead of dialing the usual 1234 call centre number 
subscribers can now dial 1235 to get their queries answered. Nawras has a 24/7 
help desk and a BlackBerry trained engineer to take care of customer concerns.<br>
<br>
The battle of the eye balls between the two has also been heating up. So, “the 
BlackBerry service ‘enables you to put your office in your pocket and always be 
connected wherever you are’.” Nawras is brandishing its ‘great connection’, 
‘service and great value’ proposition. Both the companies are using multiple 
channels like newspapers, magazines, radio, direct mailers etc to get their 
message across.<br>
<br>
<b>Trickle down effect</b><br>
Though BalckBerry’s started off as a device primarily meant for the corporate 
executives in its early years, the passage of time has seen the smart phone 
become popular amongst other customer segments. Says Kombor, “Our subscribers 
include youngsters and housewives.”<br>
<br>
BlackBerry smart phones are emerging as an important revenue stream for both 
mobile telephone operators and they are leaving no stone unturned to attract 
subscribers. These efforts will lead to an expansion of the market and better 
facilities for customers. </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

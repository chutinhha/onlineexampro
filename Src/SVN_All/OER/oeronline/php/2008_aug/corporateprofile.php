<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>A consistent ability to win big contracts has 
helped Hasan Juma Backer Trading and Contracting to emerge as a major player in 
the infrastructure space, writes Mayank Singh<br>
</b></font><br>
<font face="Verdana" size="1">
<img border="0" src="corp.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="222">The year 1996 was a watershed year for Hasan Juma 
Backer Trading and Contracting (HJB) – the company had won a RO3.3mn project to 
carry out infrastructure work (roads, electricity and landscaping) in Sohar 
Industrial Area’s phase two. The contract was a quantum leap for a company, 
which was seen as a building contractor executing projects in the one million 
rial range. Says Krishnakumar Taori, Group Managing Director, HJB, “It was a 
question of doing things on a bigger scale. We had a team which had experience 
but lacked the culture and coordination of doing things on a larger scale. 
Things improved with time and by the time we finished the job, the client was 
happy.” The fact that the company won and executed the project against stiff 
competition from bigger players gave it the confidence to train its sights on 
bigger projects. <br>
<br>
<b>Higher ground</b><br>
There has been no looking back for HJB as the company has gone onto execute a 
number of mega projects. For example in 2002 it won a tender for the expansion 
of Sur Industrial Estate. This was followed by a RO2-3mn contract for expansion 
work in Raysut Industrial Estate’s phase II and phase III. In 2005 it won a 
RO20mn water works contract – the project was one of the biggest projects till 
date in the Sultanate and marked a milestone for HJB. The project entailed 
linking 20 water locations, tanker filing stations, instrumentation etc. 
“Despite having to deal with challenges like increasing commodity prices, rising 
salaries, we had the determination to do well,” says Taori. <br>
<br>
The experience acquired on the project came handy in 2006 when HJB got an 
RO66.2mn contract from the ministry of housing, electricity and water to supply 
potable water in the Batinah region. Billed as one of the largest water supply 
contracts to be awarded, the project entailed carrying water from the Barka 
desalination plant and supplying it to the five wilayats of – Rustaq, Al Awabi, 
Musandam, Nakhal, Wadi Al Maawil and Musannah. It also required HJB to set up 45 
metre tall pumping stations, 400 kms of water pipelines and transporting water 
to 21 villages. <br>
<br>
The latest achievement for the company has been a RO9.7mn contract to develop 
the infrastructure for a significantly expanded Sohar Industrial Estate (SIE). 
As part of the contract HJB will develop a network of roads delineating plots 
earmarked for industries within the expanded park. In addition, it will also put 
in place the requisite utilities like gas supply links, potable water and sewage 
lines, power supply and telecom cables, various electro-mechanical services and 
street lighting. The contract will enable the Public Establishment for 
Industrial Estates (PEIE) which manages SIE as well as seven other industrial 
and technology parks around the country, to create a dedicated aluminium and 
plastics cluster in Sohar. <br>
<br>
<b>DNA decoded<br>
<img border="0" src="corp1.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="200" height="399"></b>A litany of projects has helped HJB achieve a CAGR (compounded annual growth 
rate) of 30 per cent over the last ten years. The company boasts of a RO125mn 
order book till date. Taori can take a large part of the credit for the growth 
of the company. In 1989 the year when he joined its ranks, HJB’s turnover was 
one million rials. Not only have revenues grown by leaps and bounds but so has 
its staff strength which has jumped from 90 in 1989 to 3000 in 2008. <br>
<br>
Having made a name for itself in the Sultanate the company has in the last five 
years ventured into the Qatar market. Says Taori, “We are doing pipelines, 
reservoirs and water works in Qatar and see a lot of potential in that market.” 
The company has a 400 man operation in Qatar and expects to beef up these 
numbers as it grows. The company is open to the idea of moving into other 
countries in the region as and when the right opportunity presents itself. <br>
<br>
HJB counts good engineering practices, team effort and the determination to do 
something better as its strengths. A major reason why the company has been able 
to finish such projects with effortless ease is because it has developed 
in-house competencies like an engineering team and electro mechanical skills.
<br>
<br>
A hands-on manager Taori is himself involved closely with the company’s planning 
and execution process. A civil engineer and a post graduate in environmental 
engineering by education he remains partial to the stream. Taori has introduced 
brainstorming sessions in the company where the latest technology and processes 
get discussed. These sessions also come in handy in dealing with bottlenecks and 
challenges. And the company has had its fair share of them in the last couple of 
years. The increase in the price of commodities like steel, copper, aluminium 
has impacted the company’s bottomline. For example the price of steel has 
escalated from US$450 per tonne to US$1800 per tonne in the last two years – a 
400 per cent increase. “This unprecedented price rise has put pressure on our 
financials as most of our contracts have no escalation clause,” says Taori. <br>
<br>
The bad news does not end there – the non-availability of crucial raw materials 
has snowballed into a bigger concern for HJB. There is a short supply of 
products like pipes in the global market. The company has been looking at 
alternative avenues to source these products. For instance HJB has had to look 
at new suppliers for ductaline pipes (used in waterworks) from countries like 
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and India. Most companies are also being forced to import 
Chinese cranes as their supply from Japan and Europe are in short supply. <br>
<br>
<b>Taking charge <br>
</b>The company is also investing in in-house capacities to ensure supply. Thus 
it has set up its own asphalt plant in Rusayl and Buraimi. HJB has also put up 
six concrete batching plants in different parts of the Sultanate bringing down 
its dependence on outside sources. Escalating manpower costs is another problem 
confronting the industry. Better salaries and opportunities in the Indian 
subcontinent is putting a strain on HJB’s manpower resources. The increase in 
infrastructure work within the GCC region has made matters worse. HJB has been 
forced to give three raises to its artisans in 2007 instead of the usual one.
<br>
<br>
The industry remains an intensively competitive one with both local and 
international players, but HJB’s local knowledge and impeccable track record is 
something that will remain unbeatable.

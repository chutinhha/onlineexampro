<b>Determining executive compensation can be a complicated task. Pascual Berrone, 
Jordan Otten and Luis R Gomez-Mejia discuss some possibilities<br>
</b><br>
Determining logical executive compensation is a tricky blend of art and science. 
Culture, country, history, social responsibility and, of course, the quest for 
company success, all play a role in structuring executive compensation schemes. 
For much of history, however, shareholder value has been the driving force 
behind how executive compensation plans are created. But is there evidence to 
support the link between executive compensation and company performance?<br>
<br>
Why is executive compensation such a thorny – and critical – issue? Because it’s 
a key factor in any discussion of corporate governance. The goal of any 
governing structure is to minimise “divergence of interests between firm owners 
and management.” Executive pay is clearly a way to control managers’ behaviour 
and ensure that it aligns with the goals of the company.<br>
<br>
The field of executive compensation has long been dominated by “agency theory,” 
which predicts a “positive relationship between executive compensation and firm 
economic performance.” Managers receive pay-for-performance awards in order to 
give them incentive to pursue the shareholders’ values; pay is established based 
on “arm’s length contracting between shareholders and the management.”<br>
<br>
Though this line of thought is pervasive among researchers (it’s often 
considered the “neoclassical” approach), the surprising truth is that little 
evidence exists to support such a relationship between executive pay and firm 
performance. In fact, some researchers attribute recent corporate scandals to 
the overemphasis on maximising shareholder value, without regard for the effects 
on other stakeholders.<br>
<br>
<b>Influence levels</b><br>
In lieu of agency theory, other internal and external influences may actually 
have greater effects on executive pay. These influences work on three levels: 
individual, organisational and institutional. At all three levels, the executive 
compensation planning process takes the social environment into consideration, 
and all three levels treat managerial discretion as a vital element.<br>
<br>
The individual level, in particular, takes managerial discretion into strong 
account. Discretion refers to “the latitude of actions of executives and the 
individual’s set of responses available which influence the context.” Managerial 
discretion turns agency theory’s “contracting” idea on its head: contracts are 
not perfect or completely thorough, and executives’ personal beliefs and 
perceptions give them the power to instigate negotiations around their 
compensation (though they are somewhat limited by “market forces and other 
governance mechanisms”). Managerial discretion can also lead to harmful outcomes 
as managers may choose to act in own self-interest.<br>
<br>
The organisational level addresses corporate purpose and a company’s board of 
directors. According to this approach, shareholder value is not the same as 
long-term value for a company. To achieve long-term value, all stakeholders’ 
interests, not just the shareholders’, must be considered. Discretion is used 
not only by managers but also by the firm and the board for establishing pay 
schemes. This explains why “comparable firms may pay comparable executives 
differently.” At the institutional level, executive compensation is considered 
“socially embedded,” and decision-making is affected by a variety of factors 
including culture, history, norms and values.<br>
<br>
This view holds that corporate governance is “a problem of social action,” and 
that executive compensation depends on societal needs and opinions. Executive 
pay differs widely among different countries, and even within a single country.<br>
With all this in mind, a new question arises: What’s missing in executive 
compensation plans? The answer is social responsibility. In the wake of 
corporate scandals like Enron, in which highly paid but unethical executives 
wreaked havoc on their workers’ lives, business ethics and corporate social 
responsibility have entered the discussion around executive compensation.<br>
<br>
<b>Maximum value</b><br>
The neoclassical economic view of executive compensation, as just discussed, 
focuses on maximising shareholder value, and “any financing or investment 
decision that is not expected to improve the value of the shareholder’s stake in 
the business is not acceptable.” As stated before, such a single-minded focus on 
financial performance can have negative consequences. But what’s the 
alternative? A stakeholder management approach, which asserts that a company is 
“a network of relationships with multiple constituencies,” holds a possible 
solution.<br>
<br>
When diverse stakeholders’ goals are all part of corporate strategy, a firm 
cannot be so single-minded. Indeed, a firm’s CSR becomes “a source of 
competitive advantage”; it “enhances its corporate reputation, improves trusting 
and cooperative relationships, provides access to superior resources, lowers 
liability exposure and enhances social legitimacy”&#8722;all of which strengthen the 
bottom line. Executive compensation is, at this point, an imperfect science. But 
one thing is clear: “relying solely on financial performance measures as the 
only criterion to which to link executive pay may lead to undesired corporate 
behaviours.”<br>
<br>
The effort to link executive compensation to social responsibility as well as 
financial performance is worthwhile, and promises to benefit executives, 
shareholders, additional stakeholders&#8722;and the companies to which they owe their 
livelihoods. <br>

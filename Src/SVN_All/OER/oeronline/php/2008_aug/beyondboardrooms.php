character building and self discovery, says Suleiman Masoud Al Harthy, CEO, 
Taameer Investments Company<br>
</b>
<br>
Suleiman Masoud Al Harthy, CEO, Taameer Investments Co, is the first Omani to 
have climbed Mt Kilimanjaro in Africa. But nobody knows about it because he is 
publicity shy. Despite his family asking him to approach the newspapers with the 
story, he is yet to do so.<br>
<br>
Now he is quietly working towards establishing the Oman chapter of Outward 
Bound, an international organisation which inspires character development and 
self-discovery in people of all ages and walks of life through challenge and 
adventure which includes activities like hiking. Out of the 30 worldwide, Oman 
Outward Bound will be the first in the whole of the Middle East.<br>
<br>
<b>Creating a difference</b><br>
<img border="0" src="bey.jpg" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="5" width="300" height="250">Harthy’s vision is to contribute to the development of youth in the country in 
whatever possible manner. In this regard, he finds that the ideals of Outward 
Bound gel with his values. <br>
<br>
Harthy believes that youth can achieve more than they ever thought possible. 
They should show compassion for others and actively engage in creating a better 
world by removing differences of race, class, culture because all human beings 
are one. Through Oman Outward Bound, Harthy hopes to inculcate the values that a 
good citizen of the country needs through activities like hiking, which is a 
great way for building friendships and have closer bonding.<br>
<br>
For Harthy, hiking is the most enjoyable time and it was this very passion which 
led him to Outward Bound in the first place. “Besides hiking, I watch movies, I 
play tennis, go jogging, reading. During my leisure time I go out with the 
family. I have two sons and two daughters,” informs Harthy. A holder of a 
masters degree in finance and investment, Harthy is one of the few Omanis who 
has a degree in Options and Derivatives, a very niche qualification.<br>
<br>
<b>Home work</b><br>
The unassuming Harthy knows exactly how to balance between work and the bliss of 
home. “I have an office in our house at Qurm, so if I have any urgent work I 
take it home. This way, my family is content to see me at home while I finish my 
work,” says Harthy. He also catches up on his reading at home.<br>
<br>
“Now I am reading an Arabic novel. Besides this, I read autobiographies of top 
businessmen, especially from the UK and US. They tell you how they cope with 
their family life and how they were able to avoid their mistakes and turn around 
the negative aspects into positive advantages,” says Harthy.<br>
<br>
The soft-spoken Harthy says the most important thing for any top executive, 
besides his own career, is to look after the family, especially children because 
they are the new generation who are going to take the country forward. </font></p>

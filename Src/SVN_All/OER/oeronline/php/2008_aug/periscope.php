<b>Telecom scrips in the region offer a good potential, but there is a need for 
investors to choose their stocks carefully. Kuwait’s Zain is one of the most 
successful telecom operators in the GCC and the recent IPO of its Saudi venture 
was a success</b><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#990000">By Matein Khalid</font><br>
</b><br>
Cost inflation, mergers, entry of new operators and multimedia convergence/data 
services have all created opportunities and risks in Gulf and Arab telecoms. I 
believe the correction that began in the Egyptian stock market in April will 
continue, with a potential 20 per cent downside risk in case for the rest of 
2008. Egypt’s valuations are at an unjustified premium to other emerging markets 
and even Gulf countries like Kuwait, Bahrain and the UAE. Yet Egypt has the 
highest inflation rate in the Middle East, at 20 per cent and the most populous 
Arab nation is vulnerable to food inflation, because so many millions of its 
poorest citizens survive on subsidised bread.<br>
<br>
While President Mubarak raised public sector wages by 30 per cent, the fact 
remains that no less than half of Egyptian government expenditure is wages and 
subsidies, meaning that a spike inflation almost guarantees a public finance 
black hole. The fact that Egypt’s inflation nightmare is taking place at a time 
of exceptional credit market stress and a spike in risk aversion among 
international fund mangers means its stock market is at risk of hot money 
outflows. <br>
<br>
<b>Telecom experience</b><br>
This was proven by Telecom Egypt, the incumbent fixed line operator that has a 
45 per cent stake in Vodafone Egypt, where payroll costs soared 17 per cent in 
2008. It is therefore no surprise that Telecom Egypt shares fell from 24 EGP 
(Egyptian pound) to their current EGP16.50 price. Yet I doubt if Telecom Egypt 
falls much below EGP15 because, despite the adverse impact of inflation on its 
profitability, (wage costs are no less than fifty percent of all costs), it is 
one of the cheapest telecom shares in the Arab world with the highest free flow 
yield. Its Vodafone stake is a growth engine, with higher margins, average 
revenue per user (ARPU) and usage metrics than even MobiNil. Telecom Egypt would 
be a buy at EGP15 for a EGP20 target or a point where its dividend yield would 
be almost 10 per cent and its enterprise value/ EBIDTA a rock bottom two times 
The DP World IPO for instance, was priced at 22 times EV/ EBIDTA). <br>
<br>
Etisalat, the dominant UAE telecom incumbent, has lost its monopoly status with 
the establishment of du, the new telecom operator. However, no less than 90 per 
cent of its revenues and profits are still derived from its home market, one of 
the most mature fixed line, mobile and Internet markets in the Arab world, with 
no less than 130 per cent mobile teledensity ratios. This is the reason why 
Etisalat has been forced to expand abroad, including bidding aggressively for 
assets like Altantique Telecom, where it has a 82 per cent stake and licenses in 
several West African countries. Moreover, while its UAE business is an 
extraordinary cash cow, most of Etisalat’s international ventures are loss 
making, though Etisalat Misr and Mobily (its Saudi Arabian venture) have great 
potential. Though the creation of du has not been followed by a classic price 
war, there is also a higher degree of competition in the home market, primarily 
in promotions and bundled services. <br>
<br>
<b>Changing mores </b><br>
<img border="0" src="peri1.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="200" height="467">The next catalyst for Etisalat is a conversion to a corporation governed by UAE 
Companies’ Law, an event that will be a milestone in the history of the UAE 
stock exchange because it will open Etisalat to foreign ownership. Meanwhile, 
Etisalat is 60 per cent owned by the UAE federal government. Another catalyst 
for the Etisalat share price is multimedia convergence, mobile broadband and 
data services as the UAE seeks to build a “knowledge society”. Etisalat also has 
valuable stakes in Qtel, Sudantel and Indonesia’s Excelcomindo and Thuraya 
through its investment in ICOS Satellite ventures. Etisalat now trades at a 
modest price earnings multiple of 11 and offers a dividend yield of three per 
cent higher than one year dollar LIBOR money markets. I believe Etisalat can be 
viewed as a conservative, long term holding at UAE Dhs18 for a UAE Dhs24 one 
year target.<br>
<br>
While Kuwait’s Zain is one of the most successful telecom operators in the GCC 
and the recent IPO of its Saudi venture was a spectacular success in the 
kingdom, Zain’s share price more than incorporates its past success and 
franchise value, with a premium valuation to both its Kuwaiti peer Wataniya. 
Moreover, a third operator in Kuwait will hit Zain’s cash flow and to other GCC 
and Arab world telecoms. I would also take profits on Saudi Zain at 25 Saudi 
riyal, which has risen an impressive 150 per cent from its IPO price on nothing 
else but, to quote Alan Greenspan’s term “irrational exuberance” by speculators. 
Similarly, I cannot justify buying Qatar Telecom (Qtel) at its current Qatari 
riyal 190, even though it has fallen from its recent high of 255 Qatari rials. 
Qtel still derives most of its revenues and profits from its home emirate, even 
though Algeria, Oman and Iraq could become its growth drivers in the future. It 
is also now evident that Qtel paid too much for Kuwait’s Wataniya and Vodafone’s 
entry in Qatar will hit Qtel’s home market cash cow. I am also skeptical about 
Qtel’s recent purchase of Temasek’s stake in Indosat at a moment when a third of 
the Indonesian budget is food and fuel subsidies, making Jakarta shares and the 
rupiah extremely vulnerable to crude oil prices, inflation, social unrest and 
global risk aversion by fund managers. For similar reasons, I believe the golden 
age of investing in Orascom Telecom is now over, with rising mobile identities 
and rising competition in its growth markets of Algeria and Iraq.<br>
<br>
However, it is dangerous to short the Orascom Telecom GDR because its high free 
cash flow leads to share buybacks and there is the tangible prospect that 
Orascom Telecom, the flagship of the Sawiris empire, could very well be a 
takeover candidate.<br>
<br>
Saudi Telecom (STC), the dominant incumbent telecom operator in Saudi Arabia, 
has now lost its fixed line and mobile monopolies as new entrants like Mobily (Etisilaat- 
Etihad) and Kuwait’s Zain Group have entered the telecom market of the most 
populous state in the GCC. Yet Saudi Arabia’s 26 million population also 
attracts telecom operators because half of all Saudis are below the age of 
eighteen, making them early adopters of mobile, broadband and Internet data 
services products. STC has lost market share to Mobily since 2005, with its 
mobile market share falling from 82 per cent in 2005 to 60 per cent now. With 14 
million subscribers, Mobily is now an established second operator in the 
Kingdom’s telecom market, though Zain recently floated its shares in the IPO and 
will cannibalise subscribers from both STC and Mobily. Since Saudi Arabia’s 
mobile telecom penetration rate is above 100 per cent, West Europe levels, 
meaning subscriber growth will be difficult in the kingdom.<br>
<br>
STC is the largest telecom operator in the Arab world. STC also has stakes in 
high growth emerging telecom markets. These stakes include a 35 per cent stake 
in Oger Telecom, founded by Rafik Hariri, who owns mobile and fixed line 
telecoms in Turkey, South Africa, Lebanon and Jordan. In addition, STC has taken 
a strategic stake in Maxis Communications, which owns stakes in India’s Aircel 
and Indonesia’s PT Natrindo Selular. Zain and Mobily will erode STC’s dominant 
market share in the Kingdom. Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent will 
compensate for STC’s slow growth in the kingdom. STC is cheap at 11 times 
current earnings, a significant discount to its GCC peers. STC is a buy below 60 
Saudi riyals for a potential one year target of 75 SR. <br>

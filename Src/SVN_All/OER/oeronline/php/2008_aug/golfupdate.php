<b>A third Claret Jug would have been the fairy tale ending  Greg ‘Shark’ 
Norman would have wished for following his wedding and honeymoon with former 
tennis great Chris Evert. But Norman went on to become the familiar tragic-hero 
again<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="golf.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="201" height="318">Greg Norman’s run for a third Claret Jug came to a disappointing end at Royal 
Birkdale after a final round 77 left the Shark at third place in the month of 
July. Still, the 53-year-old World Golf Hall of Famer made his 26th appearance 
at the British Open Championship something to remember.<br>
<br>
Norman, who lifted the Claret Jug twice before, gave the golfing world four 
wonderful days at game’s oldest and greatest championship. In doing so, Norman 
introduced a new generation of fans to one of the game’s greatest legends. His 
bold third-place finish at the British Open was still a boon for Norman, as he 
has jumped a record 480 places on the world golf rankings. Ranked 646th in the 
world before he teed off at Birkdale, Norman has soared to No 166, the biggest 
single leap in rankings history. Norman, who was No. 1 for a record 331 weeks 
before being usurped by Tiger Woods, is now at his highest ranking since 2003.<br>
<br>
The British Open had all the elements of a fairy tale like few others in golf. 
Norman, 53, married tennis great Chris Evert three weeks ago and was on the tail 
end of his honeymoon when he wound up with a two-shot lead going into the final 
round and a chance to become the oldest major champion. Instead, it ended like 
so many other majors when he was in his prime. The Shark lost his two-shot lead 
after the third hole. He still had a one-shot lead going to the back nine, but 
bogeyed three of the next four holes and had to settle for a 77 and a tie for 
third with Henrik Stenson (71).<br>
<br>
Norman, 53, was the third-round leader at Royal Birkdale and still led with nine 
holes left Sunday while playing with Padraig Harrington. He was rolling in putts 
and lashing the ball with skill and power just like it was 1986 or 1993 when he 
won the Claret Jug. He was challenging the record for oldest major winner, set 
by Connecticut native Julius Boros (48) at the 1968 PGA Championship. But his 
storybook British Open didn’t have a magical ending. He had a final-round 77, 
finishing in a tie for third, and watched Harrington shoot 69 to win his second 
consecutive title. Norman had played a familiar role as the tragic figure. A 
year ago, Harrington was an emotional wreck at Carnoustie after making double 
bogey on the final hole and beating Sergio Garcia in a playoff. Backed by a 
four-shot lead, he was afforded a pleasurable walk along the dunes toward the 
18th green, the only suspense his margin of victory.<br>
<br>
Harrington became the first European in more than a century since James Braid in 
1905-06 to win golf’s oldest championship two years is a row, smashing a pair of 
fairway metals into the par 5s Sunday that allowed him to pull away from 
mistake-prone Greg Norman and hold off a late charge by Ian Poulter for a 
four-shot victory.<br>
<br>
“Padraig played brilliantly today, even though he tried to let it get away in 
the middle of the round,” Norman said.

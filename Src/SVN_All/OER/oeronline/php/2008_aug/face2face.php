<b>As DHL completes 30 years, its Country Operations Manager, Oman, Geoff Walsh 
explains to OER’s Visvas Paul D Karra the reasons that have made DHL a trusted 
name for its customers </b><br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="face.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="200" height="237">DHL has completed 30 years in Oman What do you feel about this milestone?</b><br>
First, the statistics. We are a global company with half-a-million employees. In 
our Oman office we have a relatively small workforce, but more than 80 per cent 
of the employees are Omanis and that is the difference. Many of them have been 
working with us for many years, some for over 25 years. They have seen how the 
country has changed and things are progressing. That makes it special. We came 
here when nobody else was here. We have helped Oman grow and that’s why there is 
a clear difference between us and the competitors. We have been here for the 
long haul but some of the other players are in starting school, if you may say 
that, in the market place.<br>
<br>
<b>DHL charges a premium compared to others. Why do customers still keep coming 
back to you?</b><br>
I think you can liken it to the Harrods Store in London, or you flying first 
class in a major airline. It is the service that counts. It is not just the 
point of sale, it is the act of sale. In our customer service department, we 
first try to understand our business and that is how we interact with our 
customers. Certain key customers are taken care of individually. DHL has at the 
moment something called “first choice” motto. The idea is to make all our 
customers feel they are our first choice. And, also our employees feel that DHL 
is the first choice as an employer for them. So everybody feels it is first 
choice. People come back because of the service. If the service is bad they will 
not come back.<br>
<br>
As much as people would like to call us expensive, we are not. We provide a full 
stream of solutions as we can move by road, by air, by freight. Besides this, we 
have knowledge of the Middle East for a long time and that is why customers keep 
coming back to us.<br>
<br>
<b>Can you shed light on some of DHL’s pioneering services?<br>
</b>I think the biggest thing we have pioneered is the use of ease. We are 
present all over Oman in 16 locations, which includes all the major towns. One 
of the biggest initiatives in the Middle East is our Import Express, so you can 
have an account here and request for a collection from Timbuktu or from Sydney. 
We take care of all the paper work and ensure that you get your shipment. You 
can have one user account and you can do export, import and even door-to-door 
freight service.<br>
<br>
Since the past couple of years, we are also doing the time definite pre-nine, 
pre-12. If you want a shipment to be sent to the UAE by 9 am the next day, you 
pay a small premium and we guarantee to deliver it before 9 am otherwise you get 
your premium back. So, it gives a scale of prices and scale of services.<br>
<br>
<b>How do you view your competitors in Oman?</b><br>
There are the usual global competitors like Fedex, TNT, UPS, etc, and then the 
local ones like Aramex, besides other small players. Our advantage lies in our 
knowledge of Middle East customers because we are here since the last 30 years 
and that stands us in very good stead. We have to give the best service and best 
performance consistently. I think that is what separates us. All our competitors 
get business but if a customer has got something important to be delivered and 
needs to guarantee it reaches there, they will come to us.<br>
<br>
<b>DHL’s logistics chain has acquired a global reputation. What accounts for 
this? </b><br>
Everyone knows that DHL sends documents, parcels, etc. That is certainly our 
main strength. But what we have done is to change. If the customer asks us 
something, we look for solutions. Our strengths are our global network which is 
present in 220 countries and is the biggest in the world.<br>
<br>
We have 250 trailers moving around the Middle East and these go into Africa and 
Europe. Sometimes 10-15 of them pull automotive parts. And then, we charter an 
aircraft if it is needed. We are also the only company in the Middle East which 
has an airline of its own. We have a plane based in Bahrain.<br>
<br>
And then we have our couriers, they are not just delivery or collection boys. 
They do the scanning, they know the importance of the shipment and they get to 
know the customers because of the training we give them. It is a whole package 
oriented towards the ‘first choice’ motto.<br>
<br>
<b>Can you give us the breakdown of the express services you provide?</b><br>
DHL at present is 100-per cent owned by Deutsche Post World Net (DPWN), which 
has consolidated all of its express and logistics activities into one single 
brand. The DHL expertise is pooled from a number of companies acquired by DPWN. 
These companies are Deutsche Post Euro Express for parcel and express services 
in more than 20 countries; Exel for transport and logistics solutions; Danzas 
for air and ocean freight; and Air Express International, the largest American 
air freight provider, integrated into the Danzas group in 2001. All of them give 
the customer a wide choice.<br>
<br>
The differential for us is technology and visibility of the shipment. We give 
our customers track and trace system. We allow them to track their shipments via 
the Internet, their mobile phones or just call the customer service through our 
quality control centres. This is what they care about.<br>
<br>
<b>What is your opinion about Oman as a market?</b><br>
Oman is diversifying from oil to non-oil revenues. This is attracting a lot of 
investments and the country is growing. We have been a significant cog in the 
growth. The big multinational companies, like banks and other manufacturers who 
come into Oman, need infrastructure and DHL can help and support them to get it. 
Being here and supporting the growth is important. It is what I said about 
providing solutions. We want to be everywhere and everything for everybody. We 
want to be everybody’s first choice. <br>
<br>
<b>What are your expansion plans in the Sultanate of Oman?</b><br>
Our investment in Oman is increasing. At the moment I am drawing up the budget 
plan and I know that what I am going to invest now is more than what has been 
invested in the last 10 years.<br>
<br>
We are going to have a brand new country office in Seeb in the final quarter of 
2009. We are looking for a larger warehouse facility in Ghala area. On other 
locations, we have Express centres where people can just walk into, like a shop. 
This is what I call the retail strategy. We want it to be easy to use DHL, as 
easy as walking into a supermarket or a store to buy milk. To be a customer’s 
first choice, we have to be easy to use, we need to be reliable, and have 
quality and consistency.<br>
<br>
<b>How secure is a parcel sent by DHL?</b><br>
We do everything to make sure that every shipment is secure. Every shipment is 
treated exactly the same way. Similarly, all our offices and express centres 
have CCTVs and all our courier boys are vetted and trained to follow strict 
security procedures. Therefore, our shipments are as safe as you carry your own 
luggage on a holiday.<br>
<br>
<b>Has there been any major incident of cargo misplacement?</b><br>
There is no such major incident of cargo misplacement, only delayed cargoes 
because a company like DHL moves millions of shipments every night. They could 
be delayed because of various reasons like lack of space in an aircraft, etc. 
That is why technology is important for us because you can track where your 
shipment is.

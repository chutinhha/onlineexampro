If you purchased Oman Cables Industry shares worth RO100 in June 2005, the 
investment would have been worth over RO1,200 in June 2008. Surprised, well the 
stock has given a return of 1279.2 per cent during this period. Oman Cables is 
not alone in creating phenomenal amounts of wealth for shareholders. Al Maha 
Petroleum, Shell Oman Marketing, Oman Oil Marketing, Renaissance Services (see 
table) are some of the other companies which have given returns in excess of the 
average returns on the MSM. That’s saying a lot as the local bourse has been one 
of the best performing indices in the region. <br>
<br>
<b>Upward incline </b> <br>
The MSM-30 index closed 2007 with a year-on-year gain of 61.9 per cent. In 2006 
it reported a gain of 14.5 per cent, the highest return in the GCC. This came on 
the back of a 44.5 per cent return in 2005. Abdul Kader Askalan, CEO, Oman Arab 
Bank, states in the bank’s Investment Guide for MSM 30 companies, “We expect the 
market to continue to remain in the positive zone driven by factors such as 
strong oil prices, high cash liquidity in the system, positive currency dynamics 
and strong interest from regional and foreign investors.” <br>
<br>
There is no disputing the fact that MSM has been riding high on the overall 
economic growth in the Sultanate. Oman’s nominal GDP grew by about 8.3 per cent 
to $38.6bn in 2007. Says Ajeev Gopinathan, Senior Research Analyst, Gulf Baader 
Capital Markets, “The last three years has seen rapid economic growth and 
positive macro-economic factors due to high crude oil prices. The fiscal surplus 
has led to government spending on infrastructure. This coupled with capacity 
addition by industry and better corporate earnings have translated into 
shareholder value creation”<br>
<br>
A sectoral analysis of the top ten stocks reflects these assumptions. For 
example manufacturing companies like Oman Cables and Raysut Cement saw enhanced 
demand and capacity additions leading to volume growth and better earnings. Oil 
marketing companies like Shell, Al Maha and Oman Oil Marketing rode the crest of 
rising personal incomes and an increase in fuel demand. Renaissance Services 
+reaped the benefits of servicing the global hydrocarbon industry. While a Port 
Services Corporation serviced a larger number of shipments. Banking and 
investment companies like ONIC, National Bank of Oman and Bank Dhofar benefited 
from greater liquidity in the economy.<br>
<br>
<b>Strong foundations</b><br>
A number of other factors have helped generate shareholder interest on the local 
bourse. The growing number of initial public offerings (IPO) have attracted a 
number of new investors to the market. Omantel’s IPO in June 2005 evinced 
interest from 160,000 investors. Bank Sohar and Galfar Engineering IPO’s in 2007 
were oversubscribed by six and 14 times respectively, raising over RO82mn 
between them. The Capital Market Authority’s efforts to put in a sound market 
infrastructure has created a transparent and fair environment. The introduction 
of online trading last year is expected to attract more retail investors. If you 
are ruing a missed opportunity, maybe it is time to place some bets now, who 
knows three years down you may be laughing all the way to the bank.</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
1. The final rankings were arrived at by adding the capital appreciation and the 
dividend yield given by a company’s share. <br>
<br>
2. Companies with a market capitalisation of RO100mn and above as on June 30, 
2008 were used for the survey. <br>
<br>
3. The survey used data for the period June 30, 2005 – June 30, 2008.<br>
<br>
4. Any company which has not been traded for the last three years was not 
included in the ranking. For example a Galfar Engineering and Contracting has 
given a return of 251.8 per cent but it was excluded from the survey as it has 
been trading for less than a year. <br>
<br>
5. The data was compiled and anlaysed by Gulf Baader Capital Markets.</font></p>

<b>Oman Cables Industry has enriched shareholders way beyond their expectations
</b> <br>
<br>
If wealth creation is a major objective for companies then Oman Cables Industry 
(OCI) is its best exponent. Having given a phenomenal 1279.2 per cent stock 
return over the last three years, it is way head of its contemporaries. The 
growth of the company from 2004-07 is reflected in its top line and bottomline. 
Revenues grew by 502 per cent while profits were up by 1006 per cent. The 
company gave a 2:1 stock bonus in late 2006, this was followed by a stock split. 
These two factors further helped shareholder returns. The significant growth 
seen by the company has translated into a growing PE (price earnings) ratio. 
Thus in 2004, the company was trading at a PE multiple of 10.9 which jumped to 
15.4 times in 2008. OCI is one of the top five cable makers in the GCC. OCI has 
a strong local market with over 70 per cent market share. The company exports to 
markets like Japan, France, Germany, US and South Korea. OCI has constantly 
upgraded capacity over the years. </font></p>

<b>Constant capacity enhancements by Al Maha Petroleum Products has translated into 
higher returns</b><br>
<br>
The growth in the economy over the last couple of years has led to an increasing 
number of vehicles on the roads. This in turn, has led to an enhanced demand for 
fuel in the retail and commercial segments. Al Maha’s retail sales grew by 34 
per cent in 2007, contributing to good revenue numbers. Al Maha’s thrust on 
retail expansion has paid good dividends. The company had 110 filing stations in 
2004, which went upto 151 stations in 2008. This makes it the number two fuel 
retailing company in the sultanate after Shell Oman Marketing. The company’s 
revenue has gone up by 125 per cent from 2004-2007. Its profits over the period 
are up by 166 per cent. The growth in the economy is increasing the fuel demand 
in the commercial segment. This led to an 87 per cent growth in the sale of bulk 
fuels during 2007. The aviation sector has been another contributor to its 
growth. The company has also been introducing value added services in the market 
like Al Maha fuel cards. These factors together have enabled the company to give 
a 310.9 per cent return to shareholders over the last three years. </font></p>

<b>The returns on Shell Oman Marketing stock is a reflection of its market position</b><br>
<br>
Shell Oman Marketing Company remains the unequivocal market leader amongst the 
three oil marketing companies in Oman. It has a 50 per cent market share. The 
company has seen an overall growth in all its business segments -- retail, 
commercial, aviation and lubricants over the last three years. Along with growth 
the company constantly emphasises on an efficient supply chain with a focus on 
margins. All these factors are reflected in the 254.3 per cent return that the 
stock has given from June 2005 – June 2008. The company has also given a good 
dividend yield of 8.7 per cent (2005), 6.5 per cent (2006) and 6.9 per cent 
(2007) to shareholders. The company enjoys a high return on equity and assets. 
This shows how effective the management has been in using its assets to generate 
earnings. Over the last couple of years, it has broken the one billion litre 
mark in terms of retail volumes. The average throughput of bulk fuels per site 
grew by eight per cent in 2007 to 9.3 milion litres per annum. </font></p>

<b>Oman Oil Marketing has benefited from RISING fuel demand from retail, commercial 
and aviation segment<br>
</b>
<br>
Oman Oil Marketing Company (OOMCO) has given a stock return of 244.1 per cent 
returns over the last three years. The returns are in line with the growth that 
the company has seen from 2004-2007. For instance its revenue has increased by 
115.6 per cent, while its net profit is up by 144 per cent over the period. 
Financial year 2007 saw the company setting new benchmarks – OOMCO recorded its 
best financial performance in the company’s history. It achieved a best 
loss-time injury free record in 15 years. It recorded the highest Omanisation 
rate of 85 per cent and the best collection of debts for the year. The oil 
marketing company also completed a business re-engineering process. OOMCO is an 
Omani joint stock company engaged in the marketing and distribution of petroleum 
products. It has a trademark license agreement with Oman Oil Company for the 
right to use the trademark Oman Oil. Growth of the economy and an increase in 
the number of vehicles on the road bodes well for the stock. </font></p>

<b>Consistent growth has helped Renaissance Services to give its shareholders 
steady returns over the years</b><br>
<br>
Over the last five years Renaissance Services has grown at a compounded annual 
growth rate of 44.2 per cent in revenue and 33.8 per cent in operating profits. 
This growth finds a reflection in its shares which have given a return of over 
222 per cent from July 2005- July 2008. A strategic shift from a diversified 
business model to a focus on its oil and gas business has led to a large scale 
capacity build up. The company has announced an RO195.5mn investment programme 
for the year 2007-09. In 2007 it invested more than RO44.6mn towards this 
programme. The investment strategy focuses on three core initiatives – 
increasing the size and reducing the age profile of the offshore support vessel 
fleet; developing additional capacity in the oil and gas fabrication and ship 
repair business and expanding the capacity and geographical spread of the 
company’s permanent accommodation for contractors (PAC) facilities. The 
investment strategy and its focus on its core oil and gas business promises good 
shareholder returns in future.</font></p>

<b>A first mover advantage in building capacity and an increase in realisation has

Raysut Cement to post good earnings growth<br>
</b>
<br>
<br>
Raysut Cement carried out two major expansion projects since 2004 and with 
infrastructure and industrial projects worth US$25bn in the pipeline it is 
sitting pretty. The firming up of cement prices and with domestic demand 
increasing by a healthy 19 per cent the company reaped a virtual windfall. The 
company carried out a four year expansion programme from 2004-07 which increased 
its production capacity from one million tonnes per annum to three million 
tonnes. <br>
<br>
The capacity upgradation and better realisations has helped the company give a 
return of 219.7 per cent. Raysut increased the capacity of its on-shore 
receiving terminals in the port of Mukalla and Aden in Yemen to reach 27,000 
tonnes to cater to this emerging market. A timely increase in the number of 
specialised cement carriers which carry its products to various destinations 
through long term charters helped the company offset the increase in freight 
costs in 2007.</font></p>

its inception in 1976, PSC, the governing body of Port Sultan Qaboos has adopted 
a progressive approach in managing, maintaining and monitoring the entire

<b>ONIC Holding has created a good portfolio of investments and the results are

<br>
ONIC Holding has given a return of 140.8 per cent. Its turnover has increased 
from RO17.60mn in 2004 to RO35.49 mn in 2007 an increase of 101.65 per cent. In 
May 2008, ONIC took a 25 per cent stake in Sama Holding Company. Sama Holding 
operates in the high growth aircraft leasing business. In March 2007, ONIC made 
a strategic acquisition of 20 per cent of the shares of FrontierAlt. The latter 
is a vertically integrated financial services company in Canada. The company 
offers a choice of opportunities in restructured products, alternative 
investments and speciality investments. Sensing ONICs growth potential a number 
of regional investments firms have kept a keen eye on the company. For example 
Shuaa Capital took a 35 per cent stake in ONIC in September, 2005. Shuaa sold 
its stake to Dubai Financial, the investment arm of Dubai Holding for Dhs52.5mn 
(RO5.25mn) in April 2007. ONIC sold its 35 per cent stak in Alliance Housing 
Bank to Ahli United Bank in June 2007 for RO50.88mn. Thus ONIC has been on a 
roll in the last three years and its share price mirrors this. </font></p>

improving from 33 per cent in 2006 to 40 per cent in 2007. The bank experienced 
a positive cost of credit in 2007 through collection of non-performing loans. 
NBO was successful in further diversifying its sources of funding by procuring a 
$325mn five year syndicated loan facility from international banks at a 
competitive pricing before to the general increase in market pricing experienced

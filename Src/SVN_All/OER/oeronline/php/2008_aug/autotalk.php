        <b>The new Mazda 6 has great handling, good looks and build quality. 
        writes Malcolm Xavier CRASTA</b></font></p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="car.jpg" width="450" height="325"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">There is no doubt that the first generation Mazda 6 was a hit and set 
        the standard for its class. Now Mazda has, with the all new 6, improved 
        on the existing car taking the standards even further up the scale. 
        There is more power, more handling, more safety and we could go on. Of 
        course, the first right thing that they did was get the looks right. 
        Everything is sharper than it was and truly gives the car a modern touch 
        while still keeping to the old car’s design formula.<br>
        <br>
        There are some very surprising developments in the new Mazda 6. The 
        overall length of the car has been increased by nearly 65mm with a 50mm 
        increase in the wheelbase. This helps to increase the overall legroom in 
        the vehicle. Normally this increase in size along with improvements in 
        equipment and safety should increase the weight of the car by 90kgs 
        according to Mazda, but contrary to this, it has lost 35kgs thanks to 
        the stringent weight saving methods that Mazda has implied on the new 6. 
        They went as far as shaving 1.5kg from the audio system and 6.8kg from 
        the interior trim. Somehow this obsession for weight is very similar to 
        th at found on the Chevrolet ZO6 where even the windshield was thinner 
        than the standard car to save weight. Along with this weight-loss 
        programme Mazda has also improved the body stiffness of the car and has 
        even reduced the wind noise by a significant amount making it one of the 
        quietest cars in its class. The aerodynamics of the 6 has been improved 
        to a class leading drag coefficient of 0.27. Suspension mountings and 
        the suspension itself has been refined for a better ride and reduced 
        body vibrations. And finally the new 6 has an improved steering and 
        taller gears.</font></p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="1" src="car1.jpg" width="450" height="545"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">So what have all these improvements done to the handling? Absolute 
        wonders. The new Mazda has better everything than the existing 6. It has 
        a sharper steering and better balance through corners. The ride quality 
        has been improved by leaps and bounds along with the gears which are 
        fast and precise. Road and wind noise has been cut to a minimum. Brakes 
        are powerful and it remains stable even under heavy braking. Overall it 
        feels that it can match the best Europeans for feel, ride and handling 
        prowess, even when provoked and pushed to its limit. To add to this the 
        existing 2.3litre engine has been bored and stroked to 2.5litres and now 
        produces 168hp at 6000rpm with 167lb ft of torque at 4000rpm. The 
        competition better start getting worried especially considering that 
        Mazda now has a V6 version of the car. We’ll update you if and when it 
        arrives. <br>
        <br>
        This same attention to detail carries over to the inside as well. The 
        fit and finish is easily one of the best in its class with plush 
        leather, high quality plastics and a complete absence of low quality 
        materials. All the controls are in the right places, except maybe for 
        the track controls for the audio system, and are uncluttered easy to 
        use. Even space is above the average of this class but the lack of rear 
        AC vents was a bit surprising considering the levels of equipment 
        available in the car. Of special mention is the absolutely gargantuan 
        boot that can more than easily carry every bit of luggage that you will 
        ever need for your weekend or airport trips. Search as much as you want 
        its hard to complain about this car. It easily improves on every aspect 
        of the existing mode and then some. It has great handling, good looks, 
        build quality to match any of its rivals and to top it all a decent 
        price too. So, if you are in the market for a D-segment saloon, look no 
        further, you have found it.<br>

speaks to legal eagles about the strengths and concern areas in the existing 
framework and the changes that would facilitate foreign investment into the 
Sultanate. Mayank Singh reports </b> <br>
<br>
Having signed the WTO agreement in 2004 and the Free Trade agreement with the US 
in 2007, the government is working on revising the FDI (foreign direct 
investment) rules in the Sultanate. The revision is expected to bring the rules 
in line with the provisions of these international treaties. Says Manal Al-Abdwani, 
director general of planning and follow-up, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 
“We are working on changing the FDI policy and a committee is working out the 
details.”<br>
<br>
As countries across the world vie to attract foreign investments the importance 
of a friendly FDI policy can hardly be overstated. Says Paul Sheridon, Managing 
Partner, DentonWildeSapte, “People who want to invest billions of dollars are 
also looking at different jurisdictions. Most investors come in evincing an 
interest in investing in the Middle East and they look at what each country has 
to offer.” <br>
<br>
<b>Setting shop</b><br>
<img border="0" src="policy1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="236">The existing policy has a number of things going for it. A big plus is the 
Sultanate’s foreign ownership rules which allow investors the right to own 70 
per cent of a business in Oman. The remaining 30 per cent has to come from a 
local partner. A number of other jurisdictions permit foreign companies a 49 per 
cent ownership only. The government also has the right to waive away the 70 per 
cent clause and give foreign companies 100 per cent ownership if it feels that 
the project is in national interest. For example Microsoft Oman is completely 
owned by its international parent company. A number of power projects were 
allowed to come in with foreign ownership in excess of the mandatory 70 per 
cent. Oman changed its foreign ownership law raising the limit for ownership 
from 49 per cent to 70 per cent after signing the WTO in 2004. Says Charles 
Schofield, partner, Trowers &amp; Hamlins, “Companies which are bringing in 
proprietary technology and large investments would like to own 100 per cent of a 
business.” So this is an area where the new policy can bring about definite 
improvements.<br>
<br>
To set up a business in Oman, a company needs to get a commercial registration 
and has to fulfill a minimum capital requirement. The minimum investment being 
RO150,000 which goes up to half a million rials for 100 per cent foreign 
ownership. The promoter has a choice of taking away this sum as soon as the 
company is set up. A business can also be set up by entering into a management 
arrangement with a local partner or company. In the latter case, though an 
investor pays taxes he is technically not registered as a company. This is a 
grey area that the policy can clarify. Says Sheridon, “It would be helpful if 
there was more clarity on the matter as it creates a lot of debate on tax laws.” 
A similar conflict arises in cases where local agencies import and sell goods to 
customers. A number of principals have lately started selling to the end 
customer directly, leading to disputes. <br>
<br>
<b>No free lunches </b><br>
<img border="0" src="policy2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="175" height="246">Though a number of investors assume that Oman is a tax free country, the law 
stipulates a 12 per cent corporate tax on earnings above RO30,000 per annumn 
though sectors like tourism and agriculture are exempt from taxes. “The 
Sultanate is also promoting free trade zones in Salalah and Sohar where it gives 
tax incentives to companies. Oman also has a double tax avoidance treaty with 
countries like France, Britain, US and Vietnam which attracts investors,” says 
Schofield. The fact that jurisdictions like Dubai are working on introducing VAT 
(value added tax) soon, increases the attractiveness of Oman as a low tax 
jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
The Sultanate’s Omanisation policy is something that is looked at closely by 
potential investors. They look at the impact that the policy would have on their 
cost structure and the comparative economic benefits that they can derive by 
setting up a business in Oman. The government though reserves the right to waive 
off Omanisation targets for certain ventures. There are times when questions are 
raised about how this discretion is exercised but there is an overall acceptance 
of the government’s desire to promote employment amongst nationals. <br>
<br>
Though a few investors may have some reservations about Omanisation, the 
Sultanate offers a higher degree of economic freedom. Says Schofield, “The 
average employer would prefer Oman compared to UK or USA as the labour laws 
there are far more restrictive than Oman.” The government has lately granted 
workers the right to form trade unions. Strangely in most cases it is the 
management of the respective companies which are helping workers to form trade 
unions. <br>
<br>
<b>Red tape</b><br>
One area in which there is definite scope of improvement pertains to the 
application process. Currently, foreign investors need to get their documents 
notarised in the country of origin. Says Sheridon, “This is a long drawn out 
process adding to the time that it takes to set up a business in Oman.” There 
are countries which have done away with such a formal process and the new policy 
can bring about a degree of leniency. Once the requisite papers are in place 
then establishing a business in Oman can take anywhere between a few days to 
three weeks time.<br>
<br>
The prevalence or lack of court certainty is another issue that investors look 
for in a country. Schofield explains, “They want to know whether there are 
country specific laws that can override a contract and if so what is the 
redressal mechanism at their disposal.” Aware of this concern a number of 
countries have been working on the problem. <br>
<br>
As the usual court process takes a long time there have been demands for a fast 
track legal system for an expeditious disposal of commercial litigation. “Oman 
can establish a commercial division of the court, with judges who are trained in 
commercial law,” says Schofield. Qatar and Dubai have taken the lead by 
establishing such divisions. Adds Schofield, “The law in most countries is 
surely becoming more international and outward looking.”<br>
<br>
<b>Copyright matters</b><br>
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and copyright violation is not seen as a big 
issue in Oman. This is largely because most FDI in the Sultanate has been in 
tourism and manufacturing. These are sectors where IPR’s infringement is on the 
lower side. Says Sheridon, “Oman has just started appearing on the radar of 
foreign investors, but with its growth rate, IPRs are sure to become an 
important area.” Anticipating this the FDI policy should enshrine adequate 
safeguards for IRP and copyrights. <br>
<br>
There is also a difference of opinion whether the revised framework should be 
more of a code or a law. “Codes are more generalist and it would be difficult 
for us to interpret,” says Sheridon. The revision of the FDI policy has been in 
the works for a while and there is a need to expedite things. The blue print for 
change has gone to the ministry of legal affairs and most investors would be 
keen that it sees the light of day soon. </font></p>

tennis and Bollywood to come up with ‘Smash’</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="newsm1.jpg" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="5" width="145" height="318">James Harbridge, Partner, Trowers and Hamlins, is getting a good response to his 
fiction thriller called ‘Smash’. The book comes as a pleasant surprise, because 
lawyers are generally linked with real life crimes, not fictional thrillers.<br>
<br>
Harbridge has always been a fan of crime writing and professional tennis and has 
added Bollywood films to his list of passions since coming to Oman in 1999. 
‘Smash’ is a wonderful blend of his three loves – writing, tennis and Bollywood. 
Obviously there is an element of escapism in writing this book, admits Harbridge.<br>
<br>
“Certainly there is a part of me that thinks it is a great thing to do and so 
there is definitely an element of escaping into the text when you are creating a 
world of which you would like to be part of. It is part of the motivation,” says 
Harbridge.<br>
<br>
In a sense, Harbridge has mixed business and pleasure. Being a lawyer has helped 
him write the book competently. “The ability to plan and to think how the book 
should develop and to be ruthless in your self-editing and to reread yourself 
critically, all these skills I would never have had, if I had not gone in for 
law. It is all a mixture of mixing discipline with pleasure.”<br>
<br>
Agatha Christie has been a great inspiration for Harbridge. “It feels very 
satisfying to read 225 pages which are around 60,000 words long. There must be 
some skill and some formula to achieve this and I said someday that I should try 
and write one of those books and it will be a combination of tennis and crime,” 
Harbridge said. Released in May by Pen Press Publishers, UK, ‘Smash’ is 
available at Turtles Book Shop.</font></p>

<b>A decade of dedication and hard work has helped Fahad Al Wahaibi to climb up 
the coporate ladder</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="newsm2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="145" height="214">Fahad Al Wahaibi reached a new milestone in his career with his recent promotion 
as Director of Sales and Marketing at the Radisson SAS Residence, Dubai Marina. 
After spending nearly a decade with the Radisson SAS Hotel, Muscat, the 
dedication of the young Omani national was recognised and rewarded by The 
Rezidor Hotel Group taking him to the next level of his career path and 
providing him with an opportunity to develop and gain experience in a new and 
fast-paced market. <br>
<br>
Fahad began his career in the Food and Beverage section as a waiter in the 
popular Olivos Coffee Shop, and worked hard to earn the promotion to a 
management level in various outlets of the hotel. He made a turn in his career 
following this and took on the challenge of the position of Sales Manager which 
led to a further development as Assistant Director of Sales &amp; Marketing at the 
Radisson SAS Hotel, Muscat. <br>
<br>
In Dubai, Wahaibi will be responsible for the sales and marketing operations of 
Radisson SAS Residence, Dubai Marina, which opened on July 1, 2008. This is the 
very first luxury venture of the Radisson SAS Hotels in the Middle East, 
perfectly located in the heart of new Dubai, comprising of studios, one bedroom 
and two bedroom suites with fully equipped kitchen offering luxurious comfort 
and five star customer service. <br>
<br>
“After an enjoyable, challenging and huge learning experience at the Radisson 
SAS Hotel Muscat over the last nine and a half years, I continue to be a proud 
employee of a group that is recognised globally. My new role gives me 
responsibilities where I can combine my passion and experience with the 
resources and development that The Rezidor Hotel Group has provided. I will 
always be an ambassador for my country and thank the management from the 
Radisson SAS Hotel Muscat who have always been so supportive and encouraging and 
acted as great mentors opening the doors to this highly sought after 
opportunity,” says Wahaibi. </font></p>

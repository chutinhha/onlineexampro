            increasingly attractive. OER finds out if the growth is purely 
            cosmetic</font></b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman's market for beauty products is hotting up. The premium perfume segment, in 
particular, is witnessing a battle of the brands. Locally manufactured Amouage, 
a fragrance that positions its product as 'the most valuable perfume in the 
world', has a new competitor in town. Last month, Clive Christian of London, 
which describes its perfumes as 'the world's most expensive&quot;, launched its 
products in two outlets of the Muscat-based Capital Stores LLC as part of a 
broader expansion plan for the GCC having already established a foothold in 
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain. <br>
'Oman is a good perfume market with a long heritage and tradition of 
fragrances,&quot; says Paul M. Griffin, area director, Clive Christian. <br>
'We welcome strong competition as this helps us grow the top end of the 
worldwide perfume market,&quot; says an industry official. <br>
            <img border="0" src="scent1.jpg" align="right" width="99" height="200">The Sultanate exports Amouage to over 20 countries, including Europe, the US and 
countries in the Middle East. It can also be purchased upon major airlines and 
at duty free stores. A selection of rare attars (pure natural oils of exotic 
plants) are also available exclusively at the two Amouage Boutiques in Muscat 
while a more restricted selection at Harrods of London and a few select stores 
in the US. Although the price-range of its perfumes begins at RO28, collections 
of Amouage flasks made in 24-carat gold flasks designed by Royal Jewellers 
Aspreys of Bond Street can fetch prices upwards of RO11,000 (US$28,600). Clive 
Christian did not reveal the price of their most expensive product. <br>
To add confusion to which fragrance is the richest, Joy, a perfume produced by 
the design house of Jean Patou, claims to be 'the costliest in the world&quot;. <br>
Customers having difficulty understanding the difference between a perfume that 
is valuable, another that is costly or one that is expensive are, at least, able 
to find some other element of differentiation between them, assures a local 
shopkeeper. 'Perfumes in the premium segment may be common in price, but their 
blend, fragrance and presentation will usually be very different,&quot; she says.</font></p>

<b>Wealth of beauty </b><br>
The Middle East's beauty products market is estimated to be worth US$3.5 
billion. There is a vast shortage of shared sales data in the GCC, and no 
figures are available for Oman's perfume and make-up retail sector. However, 
there is growing evidence that the Sultanate is mirroring the growth patterns of 
the UAE in this segment. The perfume market is estimated to be worth around RO13 
million (US$33.8 million) where the demand for fragrances is forecast to grow by 
30 per cent by 2008. The sales are also helped by the fact that the UAE is 
developing as a re-export market for domestic as well as foreign brands. Volumes 
of perfume sales in the region fluctuate in seasonal cycles. For instance, 
Ramadhan and Eid promotions entice consumers, as do the various shopping 
festivals in the region. <br>
Until 20 years ago, the Gulf market was dominated by traditional Arabic 
perfumery that blended rare oils and scented spices to create products to match 
the user's skin type and personal preference. Since then, the GCC's economies 
through increasing affluence and trade liberalisation have evolved along with 
their perfume markets. The doors to beauty products from Europe and the US 
designed by fashion houses and lauded by Western celebrities have been flung 
open. <br>
'There is place for both Western and Arabic-made perfumes. What we've noticed is 
that Omani women tend to wear a combination of both,&quot; says an industry 
spokesperson. <br>
Whether foreign or locally made, it is mainly brand perception that decides 
perfume preferences. The region's consumers have become more sophisticated and 
increasingly discerning. They are perceptive to new and effective marketing 
communications and techniques. Omani perfume manufacturers have had to keep pace 
and spend more to enhance brand loyalty and also to popularise exclusive outlets 
in shopping malls. <br>
The outlook for the industry is that yet more emphasis will be made by 
manufacturers on brand-building while retailers will increasingly play a larger 
role in finding new ways to attract, and ultimately, sell those products to 
local consumers.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Retail innovation<br>
</b>Areej, a UAE-based perfume retailer, has brought to Oman its concept of 
delivering the broadest range of major international fragrances together in one 
location. This new approach has paid dividends, but Areej faced many 
difficulties when it set up shop in Muscat City Centre last year. The first was 
to convince the local agents of the leading perfume brands in the country to 
work in partnership with them. The local agents were reluctant to form such an 
alliance at first but, eventually, signed up for it. Today, their products are 
competing directly with each other under one roof. </font></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">'As a result of our sales, the business of each local agent has risen, and they 
receive more support from their principal agents in the Middle East because of 
their improving volumes,&quot; says T.J. Van Rooyen, general manager of Areej. <br>
By using the same sales tactics as those of duty free shops, Areej claims to 
lure more shoppers. 'Duty free offers customers the opportunity to reach the 
product and touch it - the barriers are broken down. Traditionally, stores in 
the region have counters preventing the consumer to interact with products 
directly and don't offer an enjoyable shopping experience,&quot; says Van Rooyen.<br>
The Areej outlets use bright lighting and clinical interiors. Shoppers are 
expected to find the stores fashionable and friendly. It has more floor space 
than a traditional perfume boutique, and there are more trained customer 
attendants on hand also. <br>
'Some of our customers may feel a bit intimidated at first when entering an 
Areej store which is so open and provides nowhere to hide from the beauty 
consultants in the store. But our staff are trained not to hound them and 
provide excellent service,&quot; says Van Rooyen. <br>
'We've also designed large beauty rooms because we respect the need for some 
element of privacy. Some people are happy to take treatment and advice on the 
floor, but many would like to do that in private,&quot; he adds. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Follow the leader </b><br>
Retail and consumer patterns in the UAE's perfume market closely follow those of 
the Sultanate. Considerable potential local consumer spending on beauty products 
drifts towards the Emirates. The market is currently dominated by companies 
including Ajmal, Abdul Samad, Al Quraishi, Malik Al Oud, Al Nourani and Al 
Haramain. There are at least twice as many European brands than native brands in 
the market. <br>
'We have been able to stave off competition by ensuring quality and by promoting 
research and development&quot; says Abdulla Ajmal, in charge of business planning and 
international operations, Ajmal Perfumes. The company was set up 50 years ago in 
Dubai. Today, tens of Ajmal products offer stiff competition to leading European 
brands in perfume stores. The variety in price and selections in fragrances are 
mind-boggling. Ajmal has invested in a sophisticated R&amp;D division which is 
authorised to issue quality certificates on behalf of the Saudi Arabia 
Standardisation Organisation (SASO). <br>
The UAE market beckons brands from far and wide. Several months ago, the 
Brazilian brand O Boticario took a plunge into the highly competitive market in 
the UAE. They did not have any reason to regret the decision, shifting in excess 
of 40,000 beauty products in six months. The company boasts outlets in Brazil, 
Portugal, Japan, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay and has a presence in Saudi Arabia 
and was planning to expand operation into other Gulf countries. <br>
Al Haramain Perfumes has more than 20 exclusive retail outlets in the Gulf 
market, of which 14 are located in the UAE. Headquartered in Ajman, it has 
manufacturing bases in Ajman, Bangkok, Laos and Cambodia. 'Our products, which 
offer fine blends of Arabian perfumes, are popular among Arab nationals. We have 
enjoyed a strong brand loyalty,&quot; says a company spokesperson. <br>
The dominance of Western brands in the region is increasing every year, 
according to V. Saji Kumar, brand manager, Grand Stores, Dubai. All the brands 
have cosmetic segments also, but perfumes rule the roost with a higher 65 per 
cent share in sales. 'The UAE nationals by and large prefer stronger perfumes to 
light ones. Incidentally, that was perhaps the reason why Rochas' Man Intense 
was a big winner in the UAE while flopping in the West,&quot; he says. <br>
At present, the most popular brands in Grand Stores across Dubai are Gucci-EDP, 
Dunhill Desire Blue and the ever-popular Chanel No. 5. Grand, which has eight 
showrooms in the UAE and supplies destination stores such as Paris Gallery. </font>

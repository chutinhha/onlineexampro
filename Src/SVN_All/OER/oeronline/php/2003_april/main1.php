            chief executive, who reflects upon the challenges that were overcome 
            to secure a better deal for the Oman India fertiliser project </font>
            </b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Although the delay in attaining financial 
closure had tested the nerves of many involved, the finance scheme may have 
benefited the Sultanate in developing the US $969-million Oman India fertiliser 
project. Today, this remarkable project-the largest investment project 
undertaken by Indian State-run companies outside of India-is on track to 
commence in July 2005. Apart from showing the world that Oman can develop 
mega-industrial projects, the fertiliser plant demonstrates that the country can 
acquire international limited recourse project financing without diminishing its 
international credit rating. <br>
&quot;The final project agreement structure insulates the project from product market 
price volatility, which helped to gain financing,&quot; says Anthony Smith, the CEO 
of Oman India Fertiliser Company (OMIFCO) SAOC, the organisation developing and 
managing the fertiliser project. <br>
He explains that a problem with the fertiliser project's original structure was 
that not only was it complicated, but downward price movements in the urea 
market would also have adversely affected the project. <br>
Although the original structure seemed reasonable at the time of conception, 
while attempting to close financing in 1999, both urea and ammonia market prices 
were depressed and far below the proposed urea floor price. This would have 
activated subordinated loans from the Gas Supplier and Indian partners involved 
in the deal. To bring back confidence to the financing players, it was decided 
to restructure the project to make it more robust and bankable, recalls Smith.
<br>
The Indian government agreed to off-take the entire urea production at 
pre-determined fixed prices and were prepared to mitigate the market price risk. 
Pre-determined fixed pricing has insulated the project from the uncertainty of 
unpredictable market prices. It must be noted that, in the recent past, urea 
prices have been volatile. <br>
The process of formulating the urea pricing, getting the Indian government to 
approve it, and then recasting project agreements was completed by end-2001. 
During this time, one of the original Indian sponsors of the fertiliser project 
was replaced. <br>
&quot;OMIFCO then encountered more or less standard project financing difficulties,&quot; 
confirms Smith. Project agreements developed among the various parties were 
subject to due diligence and changes required by the lenders. There were 
protracted negotiations on the terms of the finance agreements. The export 
credit agencies also came up with a list of changes they wanted.<br>
The second financing campaign started in March 2002, when the invitation was 
sent to the syndicating banks. The deal was well received by the banks, and 
comfortably over-subscribed. In July 2002, the parties concerned signed all the 
finance documents. Finally, there were about 260 conditions precedents attached 
to drawing down the loans. The procedure to satisfy these conditions took a huge 
effort on the part of the owner, lawyers and lenders. Successful financial 
closure was achieved on October 9, 2002. <br>
Not surprisingly, 9/11 presented OMIFCO with some difficulties. It made the 
finance markets a bit jittery. It caused turbulence in the insurance market, and 
premiums rose dramatically as a result. But these difficulties were also 
overcome. <br>
&quot;Personally speaking, I think there is plenty of finance available for well 
structured projects in Oman, but lenders are, in the current climate, examining 
risks more carefully,&quot; Smith adds. <br>
Overall, the delays had a positive impact on the fertiliser project in two ways. 
Firstly, the preferred EPC contractor nominated in 1997 was selected on the 
price it had quoted in 1996, without any escalation due to the delay. <br>
The project also gained from reduced interest rates. &quot;Had we gone ahead in 
1998-99, the interest rates would have been much higher. Although there was some 
increase in the owner's pre-closing costs because of the delay, there was a 
reduction in interest rates and no overall negative impact,&quot; says Smith. </font></p>

<b>The eagerness of lenders to arrange large-scale finance in Oman looks set to 
continue in the long term. OER reports.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">A major challenge facing banks and export credit agencies (ECAs) during the last 
decade has been to meet the demand for structured finance to support an 
increasing number of privately-funded projects in the world's developing 
economies, particularly the Middle East. In the May 2002 issue of OER, 
Rajshekhar Singh, project finance head, BankMuscat, detailed the factors why 
international lenders have relented in their enthusiasm to eye limited recourse 
project finance opportunities in the region. Although he admits that the 
prospects of a prolonged war in Iraq could potentially dry up sources of finance 
in the short term, he says the outlook remains positive. Indeed, there's over US 
$4.0 billion of local project financing transactions in the pipeline. <br>
&quot;There is enough appetite among the international lending community for project 
finance transactions in the country although there may be some banks in the 
local market that may choose to, instead, focus on retail banking among other 
strategy areas,&quot; says Singh who reaffirms that BankMuscat will continue to play 
a key role in arranging project finance in Oman. <br>
The reason for this optimism is the number of deals being brought to market as 
well as the increase in the volume of finance being arranged through commercial 
loans. He cites the example of power projects concluded in 2001 and Oman LNG's 
refinancing initiative concluded in early 2002, which attracted several 
international and regional banks. Singh also notes that the tenors for project 
financing, especially in the power sector, have lengthened, and the pricing for 
project deals has become finer. <br>
A lender looks at many project-related risks when determining the level of loan 
it will commit. These factors include the project's commercially viability, 
size, and level of debt. Omani banks are limited by how much money they can lend 
while single-borrower constraints ensure prudence is maintained. Regulatory 
norms advised by Central Bank of Oman limit local banks to lend up to 15 per 
cent of the bank's net worth to a single entity or group. There are many 
benefits attached to becoming a lead arranger on an investment project apart 
from the interest income. Firstly, assuming the project is prestigious, it can 
lift the profile of the lender. Also, lead finance arrangers usually generate 
additional revenue from arranging fees and syndication charges from the project 
management company. Moreover, some of these projects may be large, employing 
several hundred people, and it may have spin-off benefits including being a 
preferred banker to the company's employees.</font></p>

                      <b>Any project being financed in Oman will attract a number of legal issues. Imtiaz 
Shah highlights some vital issues and their solutions </b><br>
                      <br>
                      Over the past few years, the Sultanate 
has been one of the region's most active markets for projects financed on a 
limited recourse basis. The Manah Power project, Oman LNG, the recent 
independent power projects and the financial conclusion of the Oman India 
Fertiliser project mark a successful track record of major investment 
initiatives banked in Oman.<br>
Each of these projects has involved large sums of money advanced by a syndicate 
of lenders to the project company. The lenders in each case required robust and 
comprehensive security over the assets of the project company to secure their 
interests in the project. The categories of security available to lenders in 
Oman include: mortgage over land; mortgage over the commercial registration of 
the project company and its assets; mortgage over shares in the project company 
and over other securities; and assignments of receivables.<br>
Each of these categories has certain limitations in relation to the types of 
assets that are chargeable. The following assets are probably not chargeable as 
a matter of Oman law: </font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">A lease over land </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Future contingent rights </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Partners' interests in an LLC</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Fluctuating sums in bank accounts
  </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Further limitations on lenders' recourse 
exist in the law relating to the enforcement of security in the Sultanate. The 
basic rule is that security is enforced through a court order, by way of a 
public auction. It is, however, possible for the lender to ask the court to 
transfer the assets directly to him. <br>
A mechanism that has been suggested by lenders on a number of project financings 
in Oman is the sale and purchase of assets. This comprises an agreement (or 
series of agreements) between the borrower and the lenders' agent under which 
the borrower grants a put option in favour of the lenders exercisable in the 
event of a default. <br>
<br>
<b>Government support <br>
</b>The level of government support that is made available to a project may 
directly impact the project's financial viability. Consequently, most sponsors 
and lenders to recent Omani projects have, to a greater or lesser extent, 
requested the government to support their projects. Examples of the type of 
support that has been sought includes:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Tax exemptions for five or 10 years
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Exemption from Customs duties during 
  the construction phase </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Waiver of fees payable on registration 
  of security or on transfer of the shares </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Waiver of government priority as a 
  creditor </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Confirmation that no changes in the 
  law will adversely affect the project</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">Technical exemptions from certain 
  legal provisions </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Sponsors and lenders will usually prefer 
to have some support in the form of a Royal Decree. While a majority of projects 
in Oman have enjoyed this benefit, recent projects have not had such support, 
thus proving that a decree is no longer a pre-requisite for international 
lenders given Oman's strong track record in implementing projects. <br>
<br>
<b>Equity Support </b><br>
On virtually all projects, lenders will expect the sponsors to contribute equity 
to help fund the project. The extent of such equity will depend on the 
creditworthiness of the sponsors and is usually in the region of between 20 and 
30 per cent of the total project costs.<br>
In Oman, the project company has been either a limited liability company (LLC) 
or a closed joint stock company (SAOC). Particularly in the case of the latter, 
equity is usually provided by way of the sponsors increasing the share capital 
and subscribing for new shares issued by the project company. <br>
In the local context, two particular issues arise. First, the lenders will 
require the equity contributed to be in the 'project currency' (usually US 
dollars) and for it to be placed in an offshore equity reserve account, given 
the uncertainty over bank accounts in Oman. The company may find that the 
Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry (MCI) requires proof that such capital has been 
contributed into a bank in the Sultanate in Omani rials, as this will be the 
denomination of the shares. <br>
This can be dealt with in a number of ways: ministry exemption, maintaining an 
equity reserve account onshore or treating the contribution in US dollars as a 
contribution in kind of the foreign currency. A second issue arises where 
sponsors contribute equity at different times. Any intervening exchange rate 
movement could result in disparity between the agreed sponsor shareholdings. 
This can be resolved by equalisation language in the equity. <br>
<br>
<b>Project insurances </b><br>
The creation and maintenance of appropriate and adequate insurances over the 
project assets will be a major concern for the lenders, as the acquisition of 
the project assets will primarily be funded from their debt finance. In Oman, 
there are restrictions on the extent to which assets here can be insured and/or 
reinsured by insurance companies outside the country. <br>
In practice, partial waivers are obtained from the MCI so that the project is 
insured in Oman but reinsured abroad. <br>
<br>
<b>Foreign capital licences</b><br>
The major lenders on significant projects in Oman have been foreign banks with 
no business presence in the country. This may create difficulty on enforcement 
as such banks will be unable to hold certain assets transferred to them on 
enforcement, in particular interests in land or shares.<br>
In practice, the lenders will appoint an Omani bank as their 'onshore security 
agent' to hold the benefit of security on their behalf. The role of such an 
agent is set out in some detail in an onshore security agency agreement. <br>
A further issue arises where one or more foreign sponsors have contracted to 
provide services to the project company. E.g., these could be in the form of 
manpower, or technical expertise in operating a particular facility. Here, to 
comply with the Sultanate's foreign capital investment law, such a sponsor will 
generally form (with an Omani partner) a local company or, depending on the 
nature of the project, it may be able to establish a fully-owned branch office 
to carry out such services. <br>

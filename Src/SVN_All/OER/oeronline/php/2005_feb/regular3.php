of Education deploys Microsoft technology for countrywide live communications 
and collaboration<br>
</b>Last month, the Ministry of Education in the 
Sultanate of
Oman announced the completion of the first stage of its major
infrastructure upgrade project. The project, which uses
Microsoft Windows Server Systems solutions, will create the
foundation for the state-of-the-art infrastructure that will
eventually connect the Ministry and its staff with every public
school and teacher in the Sultanate.
<br>
<br>
“As part of our goal of providing the highest standards of
education, the Ministry has embarked on this project to connect
all of our staff and teachers across Oman. For such a major project,
we required not only a superior technology platform, but
also a committed partner. Microsoft’s commitment to Oman,
through its local presence, and its proven commitment to the
use of ICT in education through the Partners in Learning
Program, convinced us that Microsoft was the best partner for
this,” said Khalid Al-Siyabi, IT Director, Ministry of Education.
<br>
<br>
The Ministry’s IT department, working with personnel
from Microsoft Oman, deployed Active Directory based on
Microsoft Windows 2003 at the Muscat headquarters, and are
now ready to extend the Directory Service to regional offices
across the Sultanate. The Windows Server System, with
Windows 2003 as the foundation will provide the Ministry
with an integrated server infrastructure designed to help IT
staff to deliver new capabilities and support, while simplifying
and optimising IT infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
The initial phase of the project involved the migration of
the Ministry’s servers from Windows NT to Windows 2003.
Deployment of Windows 2003 took just two months, and the
Ministry has also deployed other elements of the Microsoft
Windows Server System like the Management Suite, Microsoft
Systems Management Server 2003 and Microsoft Operations
Manager which will provide IT staff with powerful tools to
manage a wide range of network administration and management
tasks. For internal communication across the entire staff,
instant messaging is available through the deployment of
Microsoft Live Communication Server. The communications
capabilities will be completed with the roll out of Exchange
2003, which is due to begin in the near future.
<br>
<br>
Over 900 staff in the capital access the Ministry’s network,
and one of the major elements of the project was replacing the
Windows NT directory with Windows Active Directory, to
manage user identities and network structure. The network
will be extended to another 2,000 of the Ministry’s staff that
work across eleven regions in Oman, with the eventual aim of
providing communications for 55,000 teachers in all 1,200
public schools in the Sultanate.<br>
<br>
“One of the biggest reasons that the Ministry decided to go
with Microsoft software was the presence of local support
through Microsoft Oman,” explained Arif Suri, IT Consultant,
Ministry of Education. “The fact that Microsoft is present in
Oman, with a strong team, gives us real confidence. Our IT
staff are also comfortable with Microsoft solutions, as most of
them are Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers, so Windows
Server System is very convenient both in terms of functionality
and features and in terms of maintaining and administering
the network.”</font></p>

the new Nokia 6822 phone</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im18.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="125" height="79">Last 
month, Nokia announced the latest addition to its successful line of messaging 
devices with the introduction of the Nokia 6822. Like its predecessors in 
Nokia’s messaging portfolio, which have been hailed for combining excellent 
voice features with easy thumb typing on a full keyboard, the new Nokia 6822 has 
a unique design that opens into a full messaging keyboard for richer messaging 
and documentation. The new model also has an advanced VGA camera, and 65K colour 
display.<br>
<br>
The compact messaging device supports a wide range of e-mail and instant 
messaging solutions, easy-to-use Personal Information Management (PIM) 
capabilities and wireless data synchronization. The company plans to make the 
Nokia 6822 available in the first quarter of 2005 in EMEA.<br>
<br>
Users of the Nokia 6822 benefit from carrying a single device that is versatile 
enough for both personal and business use. The compact device supports multiple 
email accounts and calendars and can be synchronized from device to PC with a 
few steps. Configuration is easy for email, messaging or Internet browsing via 
over-the-air settings available from most network operators. The phone also 
includes pre-installed mobile applications for private and business use.<br>
<br>
“People love the full-keyboard design and functionality of our messaging 
devices,” said Niklas Savander, senior vice-president of Nokia’s business device 
unit. “To date, more than two million people have adopted this popular format. 
As mobile instant messaging is gaining popularity worldwide as a quick and 
efficient conversation tool, and we expect demand for these devices to increase. 
The Nokia 6822 is a great phone and a great device for messaging at work and at 
play.”<br>
<br>
“Mobile messaging and push email continue to represent applications that will 
provide the greatest purpose and value for a growing class of mobile users,” 
said Andrew Brown, Program Manager for European Mobile Devices at IDC. “The 
Nokia 6822 represents a continuation of Nokia’s line of highly innovative flip 
open full-messaging keyboard devices, that will serve a user’s needs for both 
personal and corporate email as well as offering the latest in mobile phone 
technology.”</font></p>

conditioner sales</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im19.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="81">Global and 
regional digital leader LG Electronics has topped global air-conditioners sales 
for the fifth consecutive year notching up annual sales of ten million units in 
2004. According to leading Japanese market research consultancy Fuji-Keizai, LG 
sold more than 10 million units this year, securing 20 per cent market share. 
Fuji-Keizai estimates the global air conditioner market to be worth $52 million 
(RO20 million). <br>
<br>
The company aims to manufacture more than 12 million units in 2005. LG 
air-conditioners score on account of flexible, compact installation, quiet 
operation and low energy consumption. Kim also attributes LG’s success to 
efficient use of overseas production bases, targeted region-specific marketing 
strategies, its adoption of the world’s best core technologies and ownership of 
its core parts business. Quality training has played its part in LG’s success in 
the regional market. The company’s Air-Conditioning Academy in Dubai has trained 
more than 2,000 specialists to date, and similar academies for installers and 
contractors are run in Saudi Arabia as well.<br>
<br>
“LG is known for its innovative products that enhance consumers’ lives. Our air 
conditioners are designed to combine quality and efficiency, for comfort in all 
seasons. Technology leadership coupled with pricing advantages created by volume 
manufacturing, have led us to make major strides in the regional AC sector,” 
said K.H. Kim, president, LG Electronics Middle East and Africa Operations. <br>
<br>
“We will continue to maintain our number one position by introducing new 
technologies and products to suit market demands. <br>
<br>
We will achieve this by staying ahead of the curve in terms of technological 
development and customer service,” he added. </font></p>

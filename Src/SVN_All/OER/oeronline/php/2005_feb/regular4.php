            choice of Bluetooth-headsets – only Ericsson actively produced them, 
            but it was rather a fashion product than a commercial one. As a 
            result, prices of accessories were very high; they were sold at 
            almost half the price of the phone or even more expensive at times. 
            Today, the situation has changed. A customer can choose a suitable 
            wireless handsfree device among dozens of products, and not only 
            those made by mobile phones manufacturers. The most important things 
            today are convenience of Bluetooth headset, its price and operating 
            time. OER features some of its favourite headsets. </b><br>

            BT250 lets you talk hands-free and wirelessly on your cell phone via 
            Bluetooth technology. (It also works with some non-Bluetooth 
            devices.) The lightweight, contoured device fits securely on your 
            head, works with either ear, looks great, and it’s simple to set up. 
            Weighing less than an ounce, the FreeSpeak BT250 is constructed from 
            a soft, sound-absorbing elastomer material that reduces distortions, 
            resulting in crisp sound quality. The earpiece also features the new 
            Jabra MiniGel, a soft, ergonomic gel tip that channels sound 
            directly into your ear for better reception, improving your ability 
            to hear conversations clearly even in noisy environments. The device 
            works up to 30 feet away from your mobile phone, so you can talk and 
            walk freely even if your phone is inside your briefcase, pocket, or 
            across the room from you. It also provides you easy, intuitive 
            volume controls, and features LED and audible status indicators, and 
            you’ll get an average of up to 8 hours talk time and 240 hours

            and feels more like an accent to your clothing than a piece of 
            high-tech hardware. By using a radio link to communicate with your 
            mobile phone, it eliminates the need for a physical connection and 
            gives you total mobility within a range of up to ten metres. You can 
            use the handsfree to make and receive calls, moving freely while 
            your phone stays put in a briefcase, a desk drawer, or even the next 
            room. Although highly advanced, the Bluetooth Handsfree packs it all 
            down to about half the size of a credit card. The tiny Bluetooth 
            unit is both sophisticated and attractive, and can be worn on your 
            clothing by clipping it onto a pocket or collar, or hung freely from 
            a neck loop as a pendant. And with the interchangeable covers, you 
            can personalise its appearance even further. Quick facts: Size

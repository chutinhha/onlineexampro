                    Oman to get its first iron and steel plant</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="im43.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="99">Last 
                    month, Oman marked the beginning of a new era to augment 
                    industrial growth by signing three long-term agreements with 
                    a leading business group in the UAE to set up the nation’s 
                    first iron and steel plant. The agreements will pave the way 
                    for the UAE business group to set up one of the most modern 
                    iron and steel plants in the world, in Sohar. In three 
                    phases, the project will entail a total cost of $750 million 
                    (RO288.50 million). <br>
                    <br>
                    The agreements included an agreement on seawater intake to 
                    cool the project with the ministry of national economy; an 
                    MoU on gas supply with the ministry of oil and gas; and a 
                    land utilisation agreement with Sohar Industrial Port 
                    Company (SIPC). Al Ghaith Holding, one of the leading 
                    business groups in the UAE, will construct and manage the 
                    project. The plant, which is coming up in the Sohar 
                    Industrial Port, in technical collaboration with Midrex 
                    Technologies of the US and VAI Fuchs of Germany, will be the 
                    third iron and steel plant in the Gulf. <br>
                    <br>
                    For Oman, the agreements were signed by HE Ahmed bin 
                    Abdulnabi Macki, the Minister of National Economy and Deputy 
                    Chairman of the Financial Affairs &amp; Energy Resources 
                    Council; HE Shaikh Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Harthy, the 
                    Minister of Transportation &amp; Communications and chairman of 
                    SIPC board; and Nassir bin Khamis al-Ghashmi, the 
                    undersecretary of Oil &amp; Gas. They were signed from the 
                    Shadeed Iron and Steel LLC (a company of al-Ghaith Group of 
                    Abu-Dhabi) which will implement the project, by Ali al-Ghaith, 
                    company board chairman and Ghaith al-Ghaith, company board 
                    deputy chairman. <br>
                    HE Macki said the project is one of the important projects 
                    to be implemented at Sohar Industrial Port. He noted that 
                    the project would actively contribute to the country’s GDP. 
                    He also said that the steel project with its three phases 
                    would create 585 job opportunities for Omanis. He said the 
                    volume of investments at Sohar Industrial Port would come up 
                    to $9.5 billion (RO3.65 billion) at the end of 2008. <br>
                    <br>
                    HE Shaikh al-Harthy said he was delighted that a major GCC 
                    investor has chosen to invest in Sohar. This investment and 
                    its related cargo flows will further strengthen the position 
                    of Sohar as an Industrial Port and through the economics of 
                    scale will make use of the port more economically for all 
                    present and future users and investors. <br>
                    <br>
                    It took more than seven months for the government, SIPC and 
                    the UAE firm to clinch these prestigious pacts. The first 
                    phase of the project will produce 720,000 metric tonnes of 
                    hot bricketted iron and steel billets per year. In the 
                    second phase, the capacity will touch one million metric 
                    tonnes per year. The total cost of two phases (2007-09) is 
                    estimated at RO350 million. <br>
                    <br>
                    Shadeed Iron and Steel will expand its production capacity 
                    to four million metric tonnes per year at the end of the 
                    third phase (2009-10). The project will occupy a total area 
                    of 116 hectares in three phases. Currently, Oman’s import 
                    bill constitutes significant steel imports. <br>
                    <br>
                    Shadeed steel project will make Oman a leading producer of 
                    iron and steel in the region. Advance Projects Development, 
                    the industrial arm of Al Ghaith Holding, will be responsible 
                    for managing the project and implementing local engineering 
                    and supply. The plant is expected to export iron and steel 
                    products to neighbouring markets like the UAE, India, China, 
                    etc. </font></p>

                    Khalifa bin Mubarak Al Hinaie, adviser to the oil and gas 
                    minister for technical affairs and board chairman of Oman 
                    Gas Co. (OGC), has said the value of the company’s 
                    investment in implemented projects in addition to assets 
                    purchased from the government amounted to $800 million 
                    (RO307.70 million). In a statement last month, he said OGC 
                    planned to invest $100 million (RO38.46 million) in the 
                    coming years for implementing many projects related to gas 
                    transportation and maintenance of natural gas hubs. These 
                    projects included installation of pumps in Fahud to meet the 
                    rising requirement of gas in Sohar Industrial Estate as well 
                    as setting up piplelines to Barka power station. He added 
                    OGC was currently implementing gas distribution network to 
                    factories, which would be set up in Sohar Port at a cost of 
                    $21 million (RO8.07 million), hoping that the project would 
                    be completed by June 2005.</font></p>

                    interest rates on personal loans </b><br>
                    The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) has decided to reduce 
                    interest rate ceiling on consumer loans. The CBO had earlier 
                    decided to cut by one percentage-point the bank’s maximum 
                    charge on personal loans – from 10 to 9 per cent. HE Hamood 
                    bin Sangour Al Zadjali, the executive president of CBO, said 
                    the decision was made as a result of the decline in the 
                    value of the interest rate paid on deposits and the strong 
                    liquidity and profits in the banking sector. <br>
                    <br>
                    He said the reasons behind fixing a rate ceiling on personal 
                    loans were to prevent banks from charging higher rates and 
                    also to allow for competition without letting the ratio of 
                    personal loans exceed 42.5 per cent of the total banking 
                    credit to government and private sectors. <br>
                    <br>
                    HE Al Zadjali said it was the fourth time the CBO had 
                    reduced the interest rate ceiling on consumer loans. In 
                    early 2002, the central bank had cut the rate from 13 to 12 
                    per cent and increased the quantitative ceiling on personal 
                    loans from 35 to 40 per cent of the total bank credit. In 
                    April 2003, the CBO reduced further the rate ceiling by one 
                    percentage point to 11 per cent. <br>
                    <br>
                    The apex bank again cut the interest rate ceiling in January 
                    2004 from 11 to 10 per cent and raised the personal loan 
                    portfolio from 40 to 42.5 per cent of the total credit. HE 
                    Al Zadjali said the CBO revised annually interest rates in 
                    the local markets and elsewhere to decide whether the 
                    prevailing rate on personal loans was appropriate. <br>
                    <br>
                    He said the central bank would factor in operational costs, 
                    the level of risks and returns on shares when it decided on 
                    the loan interest rate ceiling. The executive president said 
                    the apex bank was aware of the negative effects of excessive 
                    consumer borrowing and urged licensed banks to change 
                    policies regarding maximum lending to individuals.</font></p>

                    funds allowed to invest in real estate </b><br>
                    The Capital Market Authority (CMA) has approved regulations 
                    allowing mutual funds to invest in the country’s real estate 
                    market provided they seek prior permission from its board. 
                    This is part of new regulations that were approved by the 
                    board of the regulatory authority to encourage investors to 
                    park their funds in mutual fund schemes, CMA vice-president 
                    HE Abdullah Salim al Salmy said.<br>
                    <br>
                    So far, mutual fund schemes have been investing their corpus 
                    fund in either equity instruments or bonds listed on the 
                    Muscat Securities Market (MSM). In an apparent move to 
                    encourage investment in mutual fund schemes, he said that 
                    the government has given income tax exemption to mutual 
                    funds through a recent Royal Decree.<br>
                    <br>
                    HE Al Salmy said that the new measures, which are circulated 
                    among investment companies, are aimed at regulating mutual 
                    funds in such a way that they could enhance the confidence 
                    of investors. ‘‘The funds of investors in mutual fund 
                    schemes are looked after in a proper manner. These measures 
                    are aimed at making the regulations easy for all parties 
                    concerned with mutual fund schemes – fund managers, 
                    custodians and investors,’’ he noted. <br>
                    <br>
                    Elaborating on the advantages of mutual fund investment, he 
                    said that it would enhance saving habit in the country, 
                    which is necessary for economic development. This, he said, 
                    would encourage those who have small savings potential to 
                    indirectly invest in the stock market, which in turn would 
                    check conspicuous consumption of people. Unlike investments 
                    in real estate, mutual fund schemes are easy to liquidate, 
                    he noted.</font></p>

                    companies) and Multitech LLC, a Suhail Bahwan Group Company, 
                    to the investing public. Priced at RO0.970 per share (plus 
                    20 baizas towards issue expenses), the issue was open to 
                    subscription from Omani nationals and Omani incorporated 
                    entities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Commenting on the success of the issue, Abdul Razzak Ali 
                    Issa, CEO, BankMuscat said: “We are glad that the investing 
                    public came back in such strong numbers to support the AES 
                    Barka IPO. Such investor sentiments can only augur well for 
                    organisations with strong fundamentals and carefully thought 
                    out business models that are planning to go public. With a 
                    number of IPOs in the offing including the much-awaited 
                    Omantel issue, Omani investors have much to look forward to 
                    in the New Year.”</font></p>

                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Dhofar 
                    Power’s IPO this month</b><br>
                    Dhofar Power Company (DPC) is expected to offer 35 per cent 
                    of its stake to investing public this month. PSEG group, the 
                    US-based multinational, has an 81 per cent stake in the 
                    company while the remaining 19 per cent shares are held by 
                    local investors. Sources at BankMuscat, the issue managers, 
                    said that around 10 million shares constituting 35 per cent 
                    of the issued capital of DPC would be on offer through an 
                    IPO before end of February. The offer price is yet to be 
                    finalised. The pricing principle of all independent power 
                    companies is same. <br>
                    <br>
                    The issue is for fulfilling a contractual commitment made by 
                    the founders to the government at the inception of the 
                    project. DPC will be the fourth power firm and the third one 
                    working on a build, operate and own (BOO) basis to be listed 
                    with its peers - Al Kamil Power and AES Barka. There has 
                    been tremendous response to the IPOs that were floated 
                    recently by two other independent power projects. The recent 
                    issue of AES Barka was oversubscribed by 17 times. <br>
                    <br>
                    DPC, which has a 240-MW power plant in Salalah, will 
                    eventually take over the existing power facilities from the 
                    ministry. The Salalah project, which started commercial 
                    operation sometime back, was implemented as part of the 
                    overall privatisation of the power system in that region.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike other privatisation projects undertaken to date, 
                    Salalah power project involves the whole power system, 
                    covering generation, transmission and distribution, and for 
                    the first time will involve a private company selling power 
                    to end-consumers.</font></p>

</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im45.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="100" height="110">The aggregate deposits of commercial
banks in Oman have crossed the RO2.9 billion-
mark at RO2.977 billion ($7.74 billion).
Provisional figures from the Central Bank
of Oman (CBO) revealed, on a year-onyear
basis, the combined deposits of banks
in Oman increased by 6.6 per cent from
RO2.793 billion as at the end of November
2003 to more than RO2.977 billion as at the
end of November 2004. Notwithstanding a
negative 1 per cent growth in time deposits,
provisional figures released by the CBO
indicate approximately 14 per cent jump in
banks’ savings deposits at RO731.58 million
as against RO642.98 million as at the end of November 2003. Year-on-year 
(November
2003-November 2004) analysis shows that the aggregate private sector deposits 
comprising
demand, savings and time deposits have registered a 4.2 per cent increase at
RO2.41 billion compared with RO2.31 billion, a year ago. Despite an impressive
growth in total deposits, total bank credit witnessed only 2.7 per cent growth 
at
RO3.428 billion as against RO3.338 billion. Total bank credit to private sector, 
however
increased by 3.1 per cent to RO3.205 billion compared with RO3.109 billion.
Provisional figures also show a 27.3 per cent increase in aggregate profit at 
RO80.79
million for the 11-month period ended November 30, 2004 as against RO63.4 
million
showed for the corresponding period of the preceding year. The profit should not 
be
interpreted as final as it is subject to changes. Provisions and reserved 
interest show
an increase of 15.3 per cent at 389.67 million as against RO338.04 million.</font></p>

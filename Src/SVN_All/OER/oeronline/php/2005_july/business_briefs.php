                    Diesel prices hiked to prevent smuggling<img border="1" src="bs_br1.jpg" width="120" height="109" align="right" hspace="5"></b><br>
                    HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, Minister of National Economy 
                    and Deputy Chairman of the Financial Affairs and Energy 
                    Resources Council, recently said that the price of diesel in 
                    Oman is much lower than the international market price. He 
                    stressed on the fact that the recent hike in price was meant 
                    to prevent diesel smuggling into neighbouring countries. The 
                    world market price of diesel, the Minister said, is 180 
                    baiza whereas it is 146 baiza in the Sultanate. <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides, a shortage in the volume of diesel has been noted 
                    as consumption rose by 27 per cent, which also added to the 
                    burden, Macki said. </font></p><hr size="1">

                    Renaissance Services (Renaissance) said it is proposing a 
                    private placement of one million shares. The company said, 
                    “The board of directors has proposed to consider allotting 
                    up to one million shares of the company on a private 
                    placement basis.” The private placement will result in more 
                    than 5 per cent increase in the company’s current capital of 
                    RO19.3 million. <br>
                    <br>
                    The move follows the company’s plans to acquire UK’s BUE 
                    Marine, one of the largest ship-owners and marine services 
                    groups in Europe, providing support to the offshore oil and 
                    gas industries worldwide. The acquisition will take place 
                    through Renaissance’s subsidiary Topaz Energy and Marine 
                    Dubai (Topaz). <br>
                    <br>
                    The proceeds of this placement would be partially used for 
                    meeting the purchase consideration and/or funding the future 
                    investments to be made by the company. The private placement

                    capacity</b><br>
                    Oman Refinery Company LLC will soon expand its refining 
                    capacity from the present 85,000bpd (barrels per day) to 
                    106,000bpd. ORC, the leading oil refining company in Oman, 
                    signed a syndicated term loan facility agreement involving 
                    $140 million with a consortium of regional and local banks, 
                    led by Bahrain’s Gulf International Bank (GIB) for part 
                    financing the $320 million expansion project. <br>
                    <br>
                    The expansion is expected to be completed by the end of 2006 
                    or early 2007. The term loan facility will be utilised to 
                    part finance the expansion project. Work on the expansion 
                    started seven months ago. About 60 per cent of the project 
                    cost was met by utilising ORC’s internal resources. Among 
                    the local banks participating in the deal are Oman Arab 
                    Bank, BankDhofar and OIB. Arab Bank Plc of Bahrain, National

                    recently entered the capital market with an IPO (initial 
                    public offering) of 225 million shares at a price of RO1.280 
                    per share, aggregating to RO288 million. This is the 
                    biggest-ever IPO in the history of Oman’s capital market.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The government is divesting 30 per cent of the company’s 
                    paid-up capital of RO75 million, of which, 157.5 million 
                    shares will be offered to Omani individual investors, and 
                    67.5 million shares to specified pension funds and 
                    charitable organisations. The offer closes on July 10. <br>
                    <br>
                    The enthusiasm regarding Omantel’s IPO had been high among 
                    investors since the proposal to transform the company into a 
                    public company (SAOG) was approved at the company’s general 
                    meeting. Sources said more than 500,000 application forms 
                    have already been printed. <br>
                    <br>
                    Though foreign investors cannot subscribe to the IPO now, 
                    there could be buyers three months after the listing. It is 
                    also expected that in future, the government will divest a 
                    significant portion of its stake, at least 10 per cent. The 
                    post-issue shareholding of the government in the company’s 
                    equity will stand at 70 per cent.</font></p><hr size="1">

                    and sound national economy and implement sustainable

                    <br>
                    These objectives were made public by HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi

                    seekers, education, healthcare and other services for

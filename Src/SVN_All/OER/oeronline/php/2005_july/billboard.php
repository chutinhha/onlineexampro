                    Plans To Make A Difference To Customers’. Other regional

                    three months since its commercial launch, to deliver on its 
                    promise to change the mobile communication landscape in the

                    Executive Vice President, PEIE . <br>
                    <br>
                    Al Maskari’s responsibilities include, besides running the 
                    Park’s day-to-day operations, managing the development of 
                    The Knowledge Mine (TKM), the business incubator programme

                    Commenting on his new post, Al Maskari said, “This is an 
                    exciting challenge – it’s one of the most important jobs in 
                    the field of ICT in Oman today, and I’m keen to get started. 
                    KOM has a great track record of working closely with 
                    business, government and academia. Our existing 12,000 
                    square metres of business and incubator space are already 
                    being used to good effect. Growing these areas of activity, 
                    working with a wider range of commercial partners, will be 
                    important to the long-term future of KOM and bring benefits

                    largest-ever showroom right here in Muscat. It was Ghosn’s 
                    first ever visit to the Sultanate to celebrate the opening 
                    of the brand’s flagship showroom at Qurum. A large

                    headquarters in Japan and its regional operations in Dubai

                    distinguished line-up of government and corporate-sector

                    <br>
                    “This impressive facility demonstrates our commitment to our 
                    customers in Oman in providing them with the highest quality 
                    products and most rewarding ownership experience,” said 
                    Ghosn. <br>
                    <br>
                    Suhail Bahwan, Chairman of Suhail Bahwan Group, thanked His 
                    Majesty Sultan Qaboos and the Omani leadership for nurturing 
                    the growth of a vibrant private sector and fostering 
                    economic development for the ultimate prosperity of the 
                    people of Oman. <br>
                    <br>
                    The new showroom – Nissan’s biggest in the entire world – is 
                    itself a splendid landmark that captures the spirit of a 
                    brand that inspires vision and success. This flagship 
                    showroom represents the centrepiece of a rapidly expanding 
                    network of outlets and service centres being developed by 
                    Suhail Bahwan Automobiles across the breadth of the 
                    Sultanate. Set in distinctive sections across the expanse of 
                    the showroom is the complete Nissan family – including the 
                    Sunny, Maxima Altima and 350Z – all in their individual

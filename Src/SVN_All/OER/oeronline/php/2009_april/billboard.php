                  Sultanate in the field of Internet. From a modest beginning in 
                  2005, Oman Web Awards have come a long way in recognising and 
                  promoting the progress made by companies and professionals in 
                  the world wide web in Oman. The 4th edition of Oman Web 
                  Awards, held recently, felicitated different companies across 
                  24 categories to serve as an inspiration, archive and at the 
                  same time reward creators for their skills so that they 
                  continue to improve it. It was also to promote the innovative 
                  spirit of web designers to meet professional and international 
                  standards, to promote intellectual and production 
                  opportunities, as well as to develop an interactive proactive 
                  and reactive community that aims at providing recognition to 
                  this sector in the most superlative way. Furthermore, Oman Web 
                  Awards is an encouragement for all sectors to showcase their 
                  websites and be more involved in the IT. United Media 
                  Services, the parent company of Alam Aliktisaad Wala’mal, did 
                  extremely well at the awards. UMS Interactive put up a great 
                  show at the awards as eight of its clients picked awards in 
                  different categories. www.oeronline.com, again from UMS, 
                  bagged the bronze award.<br>

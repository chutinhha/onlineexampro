                <img border="0" src="auto5.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="236">For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Sequoia, it is a 
                species of evergreen trees commonly called “Coast Redwood”. 
                These trees live for as long as 2,200 years and grow to heights 
                exceeding 115m and with a trunk diameter of 8m at the base, 
                consequently making them the tallest trees in the world. No, 
                this is not a botany lesson, the Sequoia is the name adopted for 
                the latest offering from Toyota. And, true to its name, this is 
                one big monster. End-to-end it stands at over five metres long, 
                over two metres high and weighs in at nearly three tons! The 
                Sequoia was primarily conceived for the American market. It was, 
                and still is, based on the Toyota Tundra pickup Truck and it 
                made its debut, in USA, in 2000 as a 2001 model. From its onset 
                it was very well received and was even nominated for the North 
                American Truck of the Year award for 2001.<br>
                <br>
                For the purpose of this review we decided get the two minor 
                annoyances out of the way first and then get to the good stuff. 
                The first on the list, and also the most obvious, is its sheer 
                size. As most buyers will already be aware of what they are 
                getting into, it is but a minor issue. But do keep in mind that 
                it is much larger than it initially seems, as we found out the 
                hard way while trying to find a parking spot in Ruwi. To its 
                credit, it does have one of the smallest turning circles in its 
                class making navigation of tight spots that little bit easier. 
                The second, and only other, annoyance is that some of the knobs 
                in the centre console are closer to the passenger than the 
                driver. Shorter drivers may find this to be a bit inconvenient.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="auto4.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="230">Aside from the above, the rest of the Sequoia is “all good”. It 
                was a smart move by Toyota to leave the looks of the Tundra 
                intact. It gives the Sequoia a very imposing and masculine look 
                that is perfectly suited for a vehicle of its class. Its 
                exterior is perfectly complemented by the stylish interior. The 
                two-tone dash is a funky addition and the large knobs and 
                buttons are ergonomically placed and easy to operate. The huge 
                external dimensions of the Sequoia, has ‘huge’ space benefits on 
                the interior. The head and legroom, for all three rows, are 
                easily some of the best you will find in this class of vehicle. 
                In fact the third row is so spacious that six-footers can easily 
                sit in comfort for long journeys. This is further complemented 
                by the comfortable seats and great driving position, even short 
                drivers won’t have a problem
                getting comfortable. <br>
                <br>
                To add to this, Toyota hasn’t spared any expense with the 
                features either. Even the basic version comes equipped with 
                three-zone automatic climate control, full power options 
                including power drivers seat, 14-speaker 6-CD changer audio 
                system, all-round airbags and the entire bevy of acronym filled 
                drivers aids. Head higher up the option tree and leather, 
                moonroof, power folding third-row seats, a DVD player and 
                various other options become available to you.<br>
                <br>
                On the road there is particularly special to expect. The 
                steering feel is good and, like the transmission, is responsive 
                without ever feeling too urgent. In a way, it is like a very 
                well trained horse; it does what you want it to when you want it 
                to regardless of terrain and without much fuss, just so long as 
                your expectations are within its limits. But we have to admit, 
                it was a lot more stable through corners than we initially 
                expected it to be. </font></p>

				<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">But, as we mentioned earlier, we saved the best for the last. 
                That honour has to go to the engine. The monster of a 5.7litre 
                V8 produces a colossal 381hp and 544Nm of torque. While people 
                may argue that these are net figures and that the true figures 
                are lower, there is no denying the performance that it is 
                capable of. While there are no official figures, there have been 
                tests in which the Sequoia has hit 60mph (96kmph), from 
                standstill, in under seven seconds! Regardless of these figures 
                being true or false, it definitely feels that fast and that on 
                its own deserves praise. Just don’t expect to save much fuel if 
                you attempt to test the performance for yourself.<br>
                <br>
                Overall, it seems that Toyota has a winner on its hands. It is a 
                good vehicle through and through with only a few, easily 
                overlooked minor issues. If you are in the market for a 
                full-size SUV, you should definitely check the Sequoia out. 
                Chances are that you will not be disappointed.</font></p>

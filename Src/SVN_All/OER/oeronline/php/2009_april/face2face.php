            <img border="0" src="face.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="354">Managing the financial resources of country is a delicate balancing 
            act when viewed through the prism of a global economic situation, 
            which presently lies shattered and distorted into an ugly 
            recessionary scenario.<br>
            <br>
            Financial experts say that Oman has adopted a prudent approach to 
            sustain the economy against the backdrop of a slump in oil prices 
            and crippling global financial crisis. But the last word is with the 
            person who holds the crucial position – His Excellency Ahmed bin 
            Abdulnabi Macki, Minister of National Economy and Deputy Chairman of 
            the Financial Affairs and Energy Resources Council. Excerpts of an 
            interview with HE Macki.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>From a macro-economic point of view, what effect 
            will there be on the national economy due to oil prices falling 
            below $40 per barrel?
            </strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            The recent sharp decline in crude oil prices can be expected to 
            reduce government revenue from oil, but this is expected to be 
            atleast partly offset by rising government revenues from other 
            sectors of the economy, for example the major industrial projects in 
            Sohar like the refinery and petrochemicals.<br>
            <br>
            The broader economy will also benefit with contributions from 
            private sector projects like methanol and income associated with 
            tourism and other sectors including transport and communications; a 
            consequence of the government’s drive to diversify the economy.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>
            <img border="0" src="face1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="393">Is there any benefit for the Sultanate from the 
            global slowdown?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            The fall in oil prices and the slowdown in the global economy have 
            already caused a slowdown in commodity and food prices which are 
            expected to help reduce inflationary pressures.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>What is the impact on the projects that were 
            planned before the price of oil went down?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            The macro-economic effects of the lower oil prices and the global 
            slowdown can be expected to have both positive and negative impact 
            on the economy. Obviously, Oman may receive lower oil revenues, but 
            the sharp increases in costs associated with new projects that 
            affected this region in recent years are already being moderated and 
            the inflationary affect of the rising cost of construction 
            materials, food and other key imports is expected to moderate 
            further and should provide benefits to the economy. In addition the 
            government is committed to continuing major strategic projects, 
            which if necessary will be funded from surpluses. The government’s 
            prudent policies place Oman in a strong economic position to 
            continue growth and development.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>What are your comments on the 2009 budget which has 
            been presented by you?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            As in previous years, the government has maintained a prudent 
            approach in developing its budget and while there have been a number 
            of fundamental reviews of government expenditure and revenue there 
            has not been the need for any significant changes in the budget. You 
            will recall that the 2008 budget was based on an oil price of $45 
            per barrel and this year’s budget is again based on $45 per barrel.<br>
            <br>
            The government expects that Oman’s economy will continue to grow in 
            2009, albeit not as rapidly in recent years. The government is 
            committed to achieving sustained economic growth and all major 
            strategic projects will proceed as planned. <br>
            <br>
            The government is continuing its efforts to diversify the economy 
            and create new employment opportunities through the creation of new 
            industries. Housing, education, health and other important social 
            programmes will also continue to executed.</strong></font></p>

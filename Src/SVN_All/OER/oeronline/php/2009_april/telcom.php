            <img border="0" src="tel.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="237">It was only in June of last year that the Telecommunications 
            Regulatory Authority (TRA) of Oman granted Class II licenses to five 
            companies to operate as resellers of basic mobile services. Injaz 
            International, Kalam Telecommunications, Majan Telecommunication (Renna), 
            Mazoon Mobile and FRiENDi mobile were the five companies. Since 
            then, it was only FRiENDi mobile and Renna who have showed signs of 
            activity sending a signal to mobile users that more choices are in 
            the offing.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">On March 3, FRiENDi mobile invited people to pre-book their 
            preferred mobile number free of charge. You could get the number of 
            your choice be it your car number or your birthdate or even your 
            name. And there was no limit on the numbers you could book. Both 
            Renna and FRiENDi mobile are waiting for the nod from Oman Mobile, 
            their host operator and the TRA to begin operations.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Positive signs<br>
            </b>Since launching its free booking of preferred numbers, FRiENDi 
            mobile was overwhelmed with responses both online and offline, 
            insomuch that the servers of FRiENDi mobile slowed down extensively 
            calling for internet capacity augmentation to cope up.<br>
            <br>
            Antti Arponen, CEO of FRiENDi mobile disclosed that the slowing down 
            of the FRiENDi mobile website is a positive thing because it shows 
            how people are eager for a new mobile service. “I used to walk into 
            my office at 6.30 am and find that around 3,500 people are trying to 
            log in to the website to book a number. It was only a gut feeling 
            before but now it is true. It was four years ago that Nawras had 
            launched its services and people needed something new,” Arponen 
            said.<br>
            <br>
            “FRiENDi mobile has become the first ever mobile operator in Oman to 
            allow customers to pre-book their numbers. The company could just 
            have gone ahead and announced that their SIM cards are ready for 
            sale at the customer outlets. But we did the extra thing and this is 
            how we will differentiate ourselves from our competitors,” says 
            Arponen.<br>
            <br>
            As for Renna, it seems that it is not unduly worried over the 
            developments in the market as they know their target group. Renna’s 
            branding and advertising strategy is ready, the SIM cards and 
            recharge cards have already been placed at over 250 exclusive 
            outlets, the signboards are being put up at all the dealer shops and 
            the distributor network is ready to go.<br>
            <br>
            “Even our offer prices have been finalised and our SIM card prices 
            have already been printed. We are just waiting for a go ahead from 
            our host operator and TRA. We are actually in the middle of training 
            our sales and customer-relations staff,” disclosed Niklas Nielsen, 
            CEO of Renna when Oman Economic Review caught up with him.<br>
            <br>
            “After several months of preparation, it is fascinating to see our 
            own operator logo ‘Renna’ in the mobile phone display. Our Chairman 
            Ahmed bin Saif Al Rawahi made the first call on Renna’s own systems 
            which is a milestone and a truly memorable moment in the company’s 
            history,” Nielsen said.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Competition</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="tel1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="217">Out of the two incumbents, Oman Mobile and Nawras, the former is a 
            host operator for both FRiENDi mobile and Renna. This leaves Nawras 
            as the only significant challenge for the new players. Says Arponen: 
            “FRiENDi mobile has no hidden agenda of stealing anyone’s customers. 
            All those who have booked their numbers with us are new customers to 
            us, regardless of their past history. At some stage people will say 
            they have enough mobile providers to select from, but nothing at the 
            moment provides any notice to say that consumers think they have 
            enough already.”<br>
            <br>
            Nielsen says that it is more a matter of choice and a time will come 
            when people will talk in terms of how many SIM cards a person owns 
            rather than which SIM cards. “Hopefully, consumers will have more 
            choices. But with our value added services and our slogan of being 
            easy, economical and efficient, we hope to be seen light on the 
            wallet and draw our target audience to us,” says Nielsen.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Price or service war?</b><br>
            The general market opinion is that it will ultimately boil down to a 
            price war between FRiENDi mobile, Renna and Nawras with the new 
            operators expectedly announcing lower call rates than the existing 
            prices.<br>
            <br>
            “We are not here to start a price war but price ofcourse is an 
            element but not the only element in our strategy. We do expect the 
            per minute rates to go down. International call charges will also 
            drop. We see more bundle offers and in the future you may even have 
            VoIP. But at the moment, we will try to target customers who are not 
            the core segment of our host operator. Along with attractive prices, 
            we will draw customers with our value added services,” Nielsen says.<br>
            <br>
            Arponen calls it a pricing structure rather than a price war while 
            saying that it will not do Nawras or somebody else for that matter 
            any good to re-position their whole business just to match FRiENDi 
            mobile’s call rates and services. “Not everyone wants to be a 
            FRiENDi mobile customer because only certain segments will see 
            FRiENDi mobile as a better fit. We are not for the corporate 
            customers, for example,” declares Arponen.</font></p>

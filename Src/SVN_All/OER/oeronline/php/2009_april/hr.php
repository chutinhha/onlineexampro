                and careful thought she decided to do an MBA course to upgrade

                <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Keeping up with the times</b><br>
                As businesses get more complex, there is an increasing
                need to broaden ones knowledge base to take on the challenges of 
                a globalised work place. Says Mohammed al Hadhrami, section head 
                customer service front, Nawras, “In an industry like ours 
                (Telecom) it is really important to keep track of the changes 
                taking place within the industry and outside.” Chawla recalls 
                that when he started his career some 15 years back there were 
                hardly any specialised courses in communications and Public 
                Relations (PR). The availability of focused courses is an 
                incentive for executives to sharpen their analytical prowess.<br>
                <br>
                Persuaded by his senior managers Ali Said Al-Hashmi, SM, core 
                planning, Omantel, took up the Strathclyde University MBA 
                course. A masters in telecommunications from Sultan Qaboos 
                University (SQU), the course has given Ali a cross functional 
                perspective. “Since I am in a managerial position, my technical 
                background would not have helped me, but an MBA has given me a 
                better understanding of various functions like HR, finance and 
                marketing,” says Ali.<br>
                <br>
                Undertaking these courses gives professionals a chance to 
                interact with their peer group from other sectors giving them 
                valuable insights into the working of other industries. Says 
                Ali, “In my class there are CTO’s, vice presidents and 
                departmental heads from various sectors. This gives me a flavour 
                of what others are doing, a variety of opinions helps you to 
                understand things better.”<br>

                Beyond the workplace</b><br>
                The benefits of pursuing a higher education is not just limited 
                to the workplace, but manifests itself in various ways. Says 
                Ilham, “I have been given more responsibility by my family and 
                friends (after the higher education course) as they have greater 
                belief in my decision making abilities.” There are others who 
                feel that it helps them manage their affairs better. Says Wafa 
                al Ajmi, account relationship manager, project finance, 
                BankMuscat, “It adds to your growth not only at work, but also 
                improves one’s interpersonal skills.” After working for three 
                years in BankMuscat’s Trade Finance department, Wafa went onto 
                pursue an MBA from the University of Nottingham in 2007 to get a 
                better grasp of various verticals.<br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="hr3.jpg" align="left" width="175" height="242">While there is no denying that an education adds to an 
                executive’s growth, going in for such a course throws up its own 
                set of challenges – like sacrificing quality time spent with 
                one’s family, taking time out for classes and course work and 
                financial expenses.<br>
                <br>
                Ilham confesses, “With two kids, family commitments and a full 
                time job it was difficult to accommodate various priorities.” An 
                evening course meant that she had to spend three hours, two days 
                a week in attending classes. Add to this the number of hours 
                spent on course work and tutorials and the burden gets quite 
                onerous. “It took me two-and-a-half years to finish the course, 
                but as it was becoming progressively tougher, I decided to 
                finish it as fast as possible,” adds Ilham.<br>
                <br>
                Salwa who was going back to her studies after a long gap, faced 
                other teething problems, “Initially it was difficult to 
                understand the language and there were times when I used to 
                wonder whether I was learning English or doing an MBA.” It took 
                her a semester to get comfortable with the technical jargon. “It 
                was a difficult time as I ignored my two children and family. 
                Initially I used to feel embarrassed as my children’s school was 
                right next to my institute,” she adds. Better time management 
                and giving up on leisure time is a trade-off that is required to 
                pursue an education<br>
                <br>
                <b>Financial burden</b><br>
                Doing a degree course can set one back by a few thousand rials 
                and more. For example, a masters degree can cost RO3,000 while 
                the bill for an MBA can be as high as RO8,000. Though some 
                companies like Omantel, BankMuscat, PDO and Nawras partially 
                fund such courses on a case-to-case basis, the onus of footing 
                the bills usually rests with the executive.<br>

                      Says Najla al Mayahi, market intelligence specialist, 
                      Nawras, “I see this as an investment in myself, something 
                      that I am doing for my own sake.” Najla is doing a diploma 
                      in management from ILM, England and plans to acquire a 
                      masters degree in management from Majan College. Says 
                      Ilham, “If you brought a car or a mobile phone it 
                      depreciates in value, but an investment like this adds to 
                      your life.”<br>
                <br>
                Most people would argue that a higher degree is a sure shot bet 
                to gain the next promotion. While the lure of a promotion or a 
                salary raise is surely an influence, most people aver that their 
                desire for self growth is a greater motivation than the next pay 
                raise. Says Annurag, “Even if someone told me that I will not 
                get anything out of it, I would still do this as it is a 
                personal choice.” Adds Wafa, “While the desire to get promoted 
                may be one of the drivers, it is not the only motivation.”</font></td>

                      A slowdown may be the best time to upgrade ones skills as 
                      it helps executives to be better prepared when the cycle 
                      turns. A downturn is usually followed by a sharp recovery, 
                      so as and when things improve there will be a greater 
                      demand for talented people.
                And the people who are better skilled are the ones who are 
                likely to benefit the most. Says Ali, “A crisis for one is an 
                opportunity for others.” Omani youth are gradually realising the 
                importance of upgrading their skills. Says Ali, “I have brought 
                three friends to join the course.” This portends well for the 
                future of corporate Oman. </font>

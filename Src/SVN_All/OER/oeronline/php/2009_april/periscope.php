            <font face="Verdana" size="1">It is fatal to rely on price/earnings 
            ratios amid economic recession, a credit crunch and the beginning of 
            a commercial banking provisioning cycle. This is particularly true 
            in the GCC since low disclosure and creative accounting makes 
            forecasting earnings difficult in boom times, impossible in a bear 
            market. However, if the analogy with US, European or emerging 
            markets indices is any guide, it is not unreasonable to assume a 50- 
            70 per cent fall in earnings from their 2008 peak. If so, it is 
            dangerous to assume that the GCC equities index is cheap at nine 
            times trailing earnings, even through the current valuation metrics 
            are the lowest since 2002.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Lack of data</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="peri.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="310">Apart from epic earnings risk during the world’s first synchronised 
            global recession in living memory, it is imperative to remember that 
            many GCC listed companies were founded in the past decade and there 
            is simply not enough statistical data points to make accurate 
            judgements on margins, EPS growth or even correlations to local 
            indices (correlations among GCC markets, of course, have risen 
            dramatically since the 1990’s due to the proliferation of regional 
            funds). Margins are even more difficult than earnings to forecast 
            because borrowing costs, accounting treatments and treatment of 
            impaired assets vary so dramatically among countries, sectors and 
            even blue chips. This is the reason price to tangible book value and 
            cash flow metrics might prove a far more reliable proxy for 
            valuation than proforma earnings.<br>
            <br>
            It is obviously not prudent to invest in high beta shares (banking, 
            insurance, commodities, property developers) during a deep global 
            recession, particularly if there is debt on the balance sheet. Yet, 
            since the volatility of all major global equities markets have 
            surged since the collapse of Lehman Brothers (and are unlikely to 
            drop any time soon!), it is best to seek deep value themes across 
            the GCC equity market universe. This is the reason I believe telecom 
            firms with low (ideally no) balance sheet leverage who pay dividends 
            from operating earnings and are not exposed to high risk, non GCC 
            emerging markets are probably the only safe haven in the current 
            financial storm. Consumer goods is a naturally defensive sector and 
            it is no coincidence that liquidity flows into GCC consumer shares 
            have surged. In essence, fear, not greed, rules the roost in the GCC 
            equities markets.<br>
            <br>
            It is also important to stay clear from GCC firms whose 
            profitability is linked to oil prices, property values, construction 
            and bank borrowing, which have been the kiss of death for the global 
            financial markets since summer 2008. Strong cash flows, low price to 
            tangible book value, recurrent earnings, conservative leverage, 
            international best practices disclosure are non-negotiable criteria 
            for investment in the current bearish market scenario. It is also 
            prudent not to buy shares exposed to the mood swings of global fund 
            managers or the global business cycle as domestic consumption themes 
            will clearly outperform. It is even prudent to pay valuation 
            premiums for domestic consumption shares (telecom, utilities, food) 
            that have predictable cash flows and no refinancing risk.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Betting on Saudi Arabia</b><br>
            I believe Saudi Arabia will be the best performing Gulf stock market 
            in 2009. Why? One, the recent cabinet changes by King Abdullah 
            suggests a deepening commitment to economic reforms in the kingdom, 
            highlighted by Riyadh’s accession to the WTO, liberalisation of 
            capital markets and a strategic policy to attract FDI. Two, regional 
            asset allocators continue to overweight Saudi shares in a GCC/ MENA 
            portfolio. This is the reason Saudi Arabia has consistently 
            outperformed Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) GCC index 
            since November. Three, Saudi interbank rates are barely 1 per cent, 
            the lowest in the Gulf. This demonstrates that Saudi banking has the 
            least systemic risk in the region and banking counterparties do not 
            hold cash. Four, Kuwait, UAE, Qatari banks are all plagued by losses 
            on loans related to property and equities. Kuwaiti real estate loans 
            are a third of all loans. UAE’s mortgage banks Amlak and Tamweel are 
            no longer operational. The Qatari sovereign wealth fund was forced 
            to buy the toxic assets of Qatari commercial banks. Bahraini banks 
            booked huge losses on subprime mortgage CDO’s and credit default 
            swaps in the US. However, Saudi bank loan books are not as hit by 
            property losses as elsewhere in the Gulf. Mortgages are a mere one 
            per cent of GDP. Loan deposit ratios means Saudi Arabia is the most 
            underleveraged banking system in the GCC. Saudi banks are least 
            dependent on offshore wholesale funding in the Euromarkets as the 
            medium term note market is still not open to emerging markets bank 
            borrowers.<br>
            <br>
            There are no structural property/finance issues in Saudi Arabia, 
            unlike Dubai’s external debt or Kuwaiti investment companies. Five, 
            the current rise in oil and gas prices to $45 Brent is bullish for 
            Saudi Arabia, which will do its best to ensure Nigeria, Iran, 
            Venezuela and Angola boost compliance with past OPEC production 
            cuts. Saudi Arabia does not want a spike in oil prices nor will it 
            allow a free fall, as in the 1980’s when Sheikh Yamani punished 
            overproducers by flooding spot black gold markets with Ghawar Light. 
            While I would avoid high beta, globally exposed Saudi shares like 
            SABIC or Al Rajhi, I believe defensives in telecoms (Saudi Telecom) 
            or domestic consumption (Savola) should outperform GCC banks, as the 
            liquidity data from the GCC stock exchanges suggests. The MSCI Gulf 
            index trades at 9 times trailing index, largely incorporates the 
            $600bn wealth destruction in the GCC and the epic fall in oil 
            prices, corporate earnings and global economic growth. It is not 
            inconceivable that most Gulf states will run current account 
            deficits if oil prices slide to $30, as happened in the 1990’s. 
            However, the Tadawul could then bottom at 3000- 3200 and trade in a 
            range as high as 5000. It is still premature to overweight Gulf 
            equities or any equities, I am convinced that Saudi Arabia will be 
            the winner stock market in the Gulf in 2009.<br>

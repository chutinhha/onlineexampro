            middle of a global financial crisis is an interesting time to 
            conduct a banking survey. While the period under review 2005-2008 – 
            in which the economy has performed exceptionally well does not take 
            into account the travails that the banking industry has undergone in 
            the last two to three quarters, it provides a useful context to 
            assess the outlook and challenges facing the industry. <br>
            <br>
            On an 
            initial reading, there appears to be few causes for serious concern. 
            Growth has been robust, asset quality has been very good, 
            productivity and efficiency measures have been strongly positive. 
            Regulatory barriers have worked well in keeping the sector insulated 
            from the troubles faced by the financial sector globally. “Banks in 
            Oman have done well and have not been impacted by the global 
            economic crisis,” says AbdulAziz M Al Balushi, CEO, Ahli Bank.<br>
            <br>
            Most 
            Omani Banks have established a strong franchise to raise low cost 
            deposits. The ability to grow that base is critical to their 
            effective management of the balance sheet for maintaining adequate 
            liquidity, lower their cost of borrowing and subsequent higher net 
            interest margins and finally for establishing a diversified risk 
            based asset product portfolio. In the next few years, banks need to 
            concentrate on effective channel management, offering value added 
            services, building brand recall and recognition to support their 
            growth.</font></p>

            <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            ability of Omani banks to remain resilient to the global meltdown 
            deserves kudos. At a time when banks around the globe have 
            collapsed, or have been resurrected, banks in Oman have stood tall. 
            The banking sector in general has shown good growth in net profits 
            and deposits, despite prevailing economic conditions.<br>
            <br>
            According to Global Investment House, the combined profits of all 
            listed banks in Oman, increased by 9.2 per cent in 2008, from 
            RO179.7mn in 2007 to RO195.9mn. This is despite the GCC region 
            witnessing a sharp downturn in performance from banks. According to 
            the monthly bulletin, published by the CBO, credit growth in 2008, 
            moved-up sharply to RO9.25bn, as against RO6.51bn for 2007.<br>
            <br>
            The 
            credit growth in 2008 clearly suggests that banks are not wary to 
            lend and the growth of the economy would continue, riding piggy-back 
            on such lending. Interestingly banks in Oman have no exposure to the 
            US mortgage market and are well capitalised to brace the economic 
            storm. A large part of the credit for this must go to the Central 
            Bank of Oman (CBO), for ensuring that stringent guidelines are in 
            place. “I think it has been a case of adopting prudent measures by 
            the CBO, and at the same time ensuring compliance,” says Dr Mohamed 
            Abdulaziz Kalmoor, CEO, Bank Sohar.<br>
            <br>
            The 
            Central Bank often intervenes to ensure sufficient liquidity in the 
            system, as also ensuring that banks meet the guidelines in terms of 
            capital adequacy and other provisioning. At the end of December 
            2008, the aggregate deposits of commercial banks increased by 32.1 
            per cent to RO8.6bn.</font></p>

            news is that Oman’s economy will continue to grow at a good rate 
            compared to the rest of the region and this augurs well for banks. 
            All in all, according to analysis done by OER, banks in Oman have 
            been resilient and doing well compared to peers in the region. And, 
            if banks have done well during difficult times, they are sure to 
            witness buoyant times, when global recovery happens.</font></p>

            of the banking sector during the year 2008 witnessed growth in all 
            major banking aggregates. Total assets of commercial banks,

            the possibility of some indirect effects on liquidity and to ensure 
            greater flexibility for banks in their credit deployment, the CBO 
            reduced the reserve requirement for banks from 8 per cent of deposit 
            liabilities to 5 per cent. The CBO also eased the lending ratio 
            limitation for banks from 85 per cent to 87.5 per cent with effect

            global financial crisis, which started in mid-2007, has magnified 
            into a global systemic crisis and several countries in the world are 
            either directly or indirectly facing the challenges of the 
            contagion. Given the generally adverse outlook of a significant

            an open economy, could be expected to be affected, though 
            moderately, with the international developments on certain fronts. 
            Sharp corrections in stock markets all around the world have also 
            seen some corrections taking place in the MSM. The large decline in 
            oil prices from $147 per barrel in July 2008 to about $45 currently 
            will result in corresponding decline in the country’s oil revenue, 
            exports and GDP. With an international credit freeze, access to 
            credit from global markets will be limited for banks and corporates.<br>
            <br>
            Different channels as outlined above suggests that a country like 
            Oman, despite having strong fundamentals, sound banking system, and 
            an appropriate policy environment, cannot be fully shielded from the 
            effects of the ongoing financial and growth crisis. At the same 
            time, there is nothing alarming and certain preemptive steps have 
            already been put in place by the authorities.<br>
            <br>
            The 
            government has already revised the assumed oil price for the 2009 
            budget to a conservative figure of $45 per barrel, in contrast to 
            the earlier assumed price of $55 per barrel and intends to keep the 
            development projects fully ongoing and on track.<br>
            <br>
            Oman’s 
            financial system, which is largely bank dominated, remains insulated 
            from the direct effects of the global financial crisis, since our 
            banks are neither exposed to the toxic financial assets nor to the 
            distressed global financial institutions.<br>
            <br>
            The 
            global financial crisis, and its manifestation in the form of a 
            global credit squeeze, has, however, some indirect effects on 
            liquidity, which the CBO recognised and responded proactively with 
            appropriate liquidity enhancing policy measures.<br>
            <br>
            On 
            receiving feedback from some of the commercial banks about possible 
            tightening access to US dollar liquidity in international markets, 
            and the associated concerns about rollover of short term US dollar 
            liabilities, the CBO opened two windows in consultation with the 
            government ensuring access to dollar liquidity of up to $2bn to the 
            local banks. While the first window is in the form of a swap, the 
            second window is in the form of direct lending against eligible 
            promissory notes.<br>
            <br>
            Further, 
            to ensure greater flexibility for banks in their liquidity 
            management and credit deployment, the CBO also reduced the reserve 
            requirement for banks from 8 per cent of deposit liabilities to 5 
            per cent. The CBO decided to ease the lending ratio limitation for 
            banks from 85 per cent to 87.5 per cent with effect from January 1, 
            2009, to avoid the possibility of any regulatory induced credit 
            contraction in particular towards the productive sector, so that the 
            economic growth remains unhampered. The liquidity situation in the 
            market is being constantly monitored and necessary measures, both 
            prudential and regulatory, will be taken by the CBO as and when 
            needed, depending on development in the overall economic conditions.</font></p>

            prices and the slowdown in global economic activity, could influence 
            the banking outlook in 2009.<br>
            <br>
            However, 
            it must be noted that the banking sector in Oman, had hardly any 
            exposure to the toxic assets and the crisis affected financial 
            institutions of the advanced countries. As a result, there has been 
            no direct adverse effect on our banks from the global financial 
            crisis. Global credit freeze and increased risk aversion, however, 
            imply that access to foreign capital may not be as easy as it used 
            to be before the crisis.<br>
            <br>
            As 
            outlined earlier, the CBO took proactive measures to ensure US 
            dollar liquidity access for our local banks.<br>
            <br>
            The CBO 
            is optimistic that our banks will continue to perform well in 2009, 
            although the focus of the banks may shift from fast expansion to 
            consolidation, with greater emphasis on risk management and asset 
            quality.</font></p>

            growth and sustainability. Ahli Bank has seen a transition from 
            being a housing bank to commercial bank during this period because 
            of which we have excluded the bank in our ranking.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, the newly established Bank Sohar also has been excluded. 
            The data was sourced from the published financial statements of the 
            banks, CBO reports and other published reports. Ranking based on 
            growth is done by calculating the CAGR growth of gross loans, 
            customer deposits, networth, fee income, operating profit and pet 
            profit during the period 2005 to 2008. Ranking for sustainability 
            was done by finding out the four year average of three major 
            factors, asset quality, productivity and efficiency. Asset quality 
            was ranked based on non performing assets to the gross loan amount (NPA/GL) 
            and loan provisions to non performing assets (provision
            coverage). <br>
            <br>
            Productivity is ranked based on operating profit of the bank to its 
            no. of branches and no. of employees. Efficiency considers net 
            interest margins (net interest income/average interest bearing 
            assets), cost to income ratio, return on average assets and return 
            on average equity. In Cost to Income ratio, we have excluded the 
            depreciation expenses. The rankings have been done on each of the 
            parameters to arrive at the sum of ranks for growth and 
            sustainability. Sustainability includes the sum of ranks in asset 
            quality, productivity and efficiency. The final rank has been 
            arrived by adding the growth and sustainability scores. In case of 
            equal rankings the bank with larger asset size has been given better 
            rank.</font></p>

            <br>
            “BankMuscat has identified its people (staff members) as its most 
            important asset. Aimed at low-cost deposit mobilisation, the launch 
            of the new al Mazyona Savings scheme with two daily prizes totalling 
            RO11,000 was a major initiative in 2009. BankMuscat recently

            placed the Oman Integrated Tourism Projects Fund, achieved its final 
            close at $259mn against the targeted fund size of $200mn. This is 
            the largest Oman-centric fund by a long distance,” says AbdulRazak 
            Ali Issa, Chief Executive Officer
            of the bank. <br>
            <br>
            Outlining the other initiatives Issa says, “BankMuscat is currently 
            the only acquiring bank on the national e-payment gateway launched 
            by the Information Technology Authority. With a major focus of

            consumer banking, wholesale banking and international operations 
            contributed to the strong performance. Explaining the other reasons 
            for a stellar performance Issa says, “The bank was successful in 
            attracting low-cost deposits. It also launched several innovative 
            services for the largest banking family in Oman. We launched 
            priority banking service to meet the special needs of customers in 
            this segment. In 2008, the focus was to improve the reach of 
            channels to all customers. To this end, the bank expanded its mobile 
            banking services to customers of both the telecom service providers 
            in the country. The bank undertook two major initiatives during 2008 
            to participate in the government’s vision to promote e-services in 
            the country. The bank is focused on its vision of attracting over 
            one million satisfied customers by 2010.”<br>
            <br>
            In 
            project finance, BankMuscat has played an integral part in several 
            large-scale financial closures. These include projects in key 
            sectors such as oil and gas, LNG and chemical carriers, 
            petrochemicals, power and water and tourism projects. In addition, 
            the bank has also participated in several overseas syndicated 
            transactions, which has increased its profile in the market.<br>
            <br>
            BankMuscat views industrial development of Sohar and Salalah as 
            strategic opportunities. In Salalah, the bank has been mandated for 
            financing the expansion of the port and is involved with two large 
            projects in the free zone. <br>
            <br>
            “The 
            major projects in Sohar in which BankMuscat is involved are Oman Gas 
            Company, Oman Refinery and Petrochemicals, Sohar Power, Aromatics 
            Oman, Sohar Aluminium, Oman Aluminium, Oiltanking Odfjell Terminals 
            and GIPI Steel pipe project. BankMuscat has been the lead

            every household. “The vision to reach every household in the country 
            has helped the bank to grow its customer base to exceed 750,000 
            customers, mainly by growing the number of retail customers. Several 
            product innovations were launched during the year, chiefly deposit 
            units under the brand name ‘Sanadat Al Edhekar’ and now the new Al 
            Mazyona savings scheme offering daily prizes of RO11,000,” says Issa.<br>
            <br>
            The bank 
            launched for the first time in the country an installment facility 
            on credit cards. Instead of the usual minimum balance payment 
            collection on the amount spent through the card, the bank collects 
            the total purchase amount of select items in equal installments, 
            thereby providing customers the ability to plan their cash flows. 
            “To meet the specialised needs of different segment of home loan 
            customers, variants of the home loan product was also launched. A 
            significant re-launch was car loan under the brand name ‘Sayyarati’. 
            To complement the popular Hayatuna family protection plan, motor 
            insurance was re-launched through a tie-up with a new insurance

            preferential shares worth RO12mn and by issuing bonus shares worth

            OAB 
            prides itself as the first choice for project finance. The bank has 
            developed a strong corporate finance model over the years. For 
            example, it starts gathering information about a company which may 
            require project finance. Executives from the bank approach such 
            companies trying to guage their requirements. It then offers them a 
            host of services. For example for Sohar Aluminium it set up an 
            onsite branch for the project. The bank has the unique distinction 
            of financing 90 per cent of the projects in Sohar. It recently lent 
            Renaissance Services a huge sum of loan. “Our association with Arab 
            Bank (its parent company) and our relationship with international 
            banks helps us to offer our clients the best service.”<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#CC3300"><b>Retail 
            focus</b></font><br>
            The bank 
            has strengthened its presence in retail banking over the last couple 
            of years by offering loans a portfolio of offerings like – Al 
            Madmoon education loans, Al Dar home loans, Markabatti car loans, 
            bankassurance etc. OAB is gearing up to increase its lending to 
            small and medium enterprises. The bank is drawing up a programme for 
            SME banking and hopes to get cracking on this front this year. 
            Despite such efforts the bank is conscious about its social 
            responsibilities. “We do not market personal loans as aggressively 
            as other banks as we believe that people should borrow money 
            prudently against their salary,” says Askalan.&nbsp; As a result the 
            bank’s retail loans as a percentage of its total lending is lower 
            than other banks. <br>
            <br>
            In 
            hindsight, the policy has paid off for the bank, as in these 
            troubled times, the bank is sitting pretty. Its non-performing 
            assets (NPA’s) for 2008 stood at 1.6 per cent. The bank takes 10 per 
            cent of its profit and puts it in the general reserve fund and 10 
            per cent in the legal reserve fund. <br>
            <br>
            Taking 
            into account the macro picture, Askalan says, “There is no serious 
            situation in Oman. There are certain banks which have been affected, 
            as they have invested outside, but not to a serious extent.” 
            Probably, international banks can take a leaf out of OAB’s banking 
            model.</font></p>

            committed to deliver the best to our customers,” says Babicci. <br>
            <br>
            The last 
            few years have seen Bank Dhofar having a significant presence in 
            project finance. It has already funded projects like Mirabat Beach, 
            Octal etc. Going forward, the bank plans to increase its presence, 
            as and when opportunities arise. “Over the past five years project 
            financing has been on the increase in Oman as well as the rest of 
            GCC. Recognising this, Bank Dhofar has created a specialised 
            department to deal in this niche segment early on and thus had 
            participated in major project/infrastructural financing in the 
            country. Currently, project finance/syndicated loans forms a 
            substantial part of our total corporate lending. Bank Dhofar by 
            virtue of an increased capital base and the expertise built over the 
            years, is now in a position to lead arrange the financing for medium 
            size projects,” says Babicci. <br>
            <br>
            According to him, the advantage Bank Dhofar has over large foreign 
            banks lies primarily in the understanding of the local environment, 
            local laws and regulations and other peculiarities of the market. 
            For project finance, Bank Dhofar will look at opportunities in the 
            oil and gas, tourism and construction sectors. “Going forward, over 
            the long term we envisage a host of lending opportunities in the 
            infrastructure, oil and gas, construction and tourism sectors taking 
            into account the large government sponsored projects on the anvil as 
            well as those privately sponsored. However, against the backdrop of 
            the current global economic and financial crisis we expect a 
            slowdown in the launching of new projects especially in the first 
            half of the year,” says Babicci. <br>

            <img border="0" src="cover18.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="228">On the 
            retail front, the bank will continue to grow its network and garner 
            low cost deposits. Bank Dhofar already has 52 branches and products 
            that are tailor-made to meet customer requirements. The future 
            emphasis would be on people, processes and technology. <br>
            <br>
            “We are 
            now continuously working on enhancing our customer service and 
            therefore to deliver this we are focusing on our People, Process and 
            Technology. We have enhanced our Human Resource management and 
            improved their capabilities through training and development.&nbsp; We 
            are simultaneously improving our business process and hence are in 
            the process of a comprehensive “process re-engineering” project, to 
            enhance our service quality. We are currently improving our 
            technology via implanting a new core banking system to provide a 
            faster turnaround time to our customers,” disclosed Babicci.<br>
            <br>
            To 
            augment resources, Bank Dhofar in December 2008, raised money 
            through a rights issue and the bank’s capital has gone up to 
            RO188.43mn. The enhanced capital is expected to enable the bank to 
            strengthen operations and provide for growth. “We have an ambitious 
            strategic plan and this additional capital is part of that strategy. 
            The bank visualises a significant expansion in the economy and 
            credit creation. This fund-raising exercise will enable the bank to 
            play a vital role in this process thereby increasing the asset base, 
            strengthening the capital adequacy and improving the profitability,” 
            says Babicci. <br>
            <br>
            The 
            banking sector, has been one of the worst effected in the present 
            global economic crisis. However, according to Babicci, the banking 
            sector in Oman continues to be resilient. He attributes the 
            soundness to prudent measures introduced by the Central Bank of 
            Oman, though he admits that there are some challenges. “The current 
            slowdown is a challenge not only for Bank Dhofar, but the country 
            and the world,” says Babicci.</font></p>

            Bank of Oman (NBO) is witnessing an aggressive growth on all fronts, 
            at a time when the banking industry around the globe, is reeling 
            under the effects of an economic recession. The main initiatives at 
            the bank have been to significantly improve and deepen its footprint 
            in the business.&nbsp; In the recent past, the bank had opened very few 
            new branches and this has been radically addressed during the course 
            of 2008 and the early part of 2009 by the opening of eight branches 
            to-date, with a further four scheduled early this year.&nbsp; This 
            represents a 20 per cent increase in distribution capability, and 
            clearly highlights the bank’s significant investment in 
            distribution, in order to serve customers better. <br>
            <br>
            “We 
            recognise that for many of our customers or potential customers, 
            bricks and mortar still represent a preferable distribution point to 
            access financial products and services.&nbsp; As well as this, the bank 
            has also invested heavily in technology and, in the course of the 
            next few months, will be launching a completely revised call centre 
            and interactive voice response system and a new branch front end 
            system with anti-money laundering capability and Customer 
            Relationship Management. In addition, the bank has been upgrading 
            significantly its Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity systems 
            and processes in order to ensure that our service to customers is 
            maintained 24 x 7 in the event of any physical dislocation in 
            communications, for example,” says Murray Sims, Chief Executive 
            Officer of the bank. <br>

            also invested in its International Banking division by supplementing 
            its research and brokerage capabilities and has launched a suite of 
            new products in retail banking such as the region’s first vertical 
            Platinum Card; revised Al Kanz Savings Scheme; Bancassurance 
            products; a dedicated telesales and direct sales channel; launch of

            Wealth Management service with three distribution points opening in 
            the next few months.&nbsp; NBO continues to invest heavily in its 
            national staff and has been the recipient of a number of awards, 
            most lately being recognised by the GCC Ministers of Labour and 
            Social Development in their 25th Session in Doha, Qatar, at which 
            the bank was honoured as the leading banking institution in the 
            Sultanate for Omanisation and Human Resource Development. “This 
            continues to be a focus of key attention. With the assistance of our 
            strategic partner, Commercial Bank of Qatar, the bank has also 
            significantly upgraded its risk management processes and systems and 
            late last year, the bank was the recipient of the Hawkamah Union of 
            Arab Banks’ Award for Best Regional Bank in Corporate Governance,” 
            adds Sims.<br>
            <br>
            NBO has 
            posted good financials in 2007 and 2008.&nbsp; According to the CEO, some 
            of the reasons for the growth, include the fact that the bank has 
            increased significantly its lending, both in personal and corporate 
            terms, on the basis of sustained effort and customer relationship 
            management and also taking advantage of the buoyant economic 
            conditions experienced in the Sultanate during the period.&nbsp; “There 
            has been an intense focus on all key business income drivers, which 
            has reaped rewards in the improvements noted at the operating profit 
            level,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            During 
            the course of 2008, NBO participated successfully in a number of 
            syndicated projects. However, with the recent global slowdown and 
            the very limited availability of dollars for long term financing, it 
            has been more challenging for the bank to actively assist in 
            providing long term infrastructural dollar based syndicated or other 
            types of financing.&nbsp;
            “As markets return to stability and with the continuing support of 
            the regulator, Central Bank of Oman, who have taken a number of 
            proactive measures in this regard, we see Project Finance as being 
            an important continuing source of both fee and interest income for 
            the bank, in the years to come,“ says Sims.<br>
            <br>
            NBO 
            plans to take advantage of the demographics of the Sultanate of Oman 
            to continue to grow. “Approximately 50 per cent of the population is 
            aged 21 or less. We see this as a very positive factor. When these 
            individuals come on to the job market, it will lead to increased 
            demand for retail financial services across the spectrum.&nbsp; The 
            investments that we have made in distribution, sales, marketing, 
            products, wealth management etc., are all indicators of the very 
            considerable importance that the bank places in this area,” he adds. 
            According to Sims the recent rebranding of the bank has been well 
            received by all stakeholders of the bank – from the staff to the 
            customers to the regulators and shareholders of the bank.&nbsp; “This 
            also clearly highlights the importance that we now place on 
            developing our business within the Sultanate of Oman and where we 
            see the bank enjoying its best competitive advantage as opposed to 
            overseas,” he says.</font></p>

            conditions witnessed the world over. “Recessionary market forces 
            whenever experienced will always represent a challenge for a 
            financial institution.&nbsp; At NBO, we are reacting to these changed 
            market circumstances by significantly increasing our focus on risk 
            management, but at the same time, making sure that we are there for 
            our longstanding, loyal customers to assist them through potentially 
            difficult times ahead,” Sims reveals. <br>

            NBO has 
            over the years, given good returns to shareholders. In fact, with 
            the exception of the performance over the last six months, NBO has 
            been amongst the top tier performers in Oman from a shareholder 
            value perspective. Despite the current correction in the overall 
            market, the cumulative return over three years (Dec 31, 2005 to Dec 
            31, 2008) is 18.84 per cent.</font></p>

            while maintaining a thrust on being a good corporate citizen. <br>
            <br>
            “The 
            founding fathers were adamant that we build a solid and robust 
            institution, one that serves the local economy. The first thing that 
            we had to do was to chalk out a distinctive strategy. Within that 
            strategy we had to achieve the overarching objectives, while taking 
            into consideration the gaps in the market. To remain competitive and 
            penetrate the market one needs to identify such gaps and 
            opportunities, along with the customers needs and requirements,” 
            says Dr Mohamed Abdulaziz Kalmoor, CEO, Bank Sohar.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>

            </b>Bank 
            Sohar has penetrated the market with a sense of urgency and Dr 
            Kalmoor explains: “It was important to do so for a number of 
            reasons. We carefully studied the experience of other banks in Oman 
            and noted that those banks which did not develop beyond their 
            infancy stage had difficulty in withstanding competition. They 
            ended-up being acquired by other banks.”<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, as a fledgling in the banking sector, Bank Sohar, had a 
            two-phased strategy to brace competition. The first was to achieve a 
            minimum size and the second was to consolidate its position. “There 
            has to be a minimum critical mass, for both operations and scope. 
            This helps a bank like us, to establish a footprint from a 
            competitive standpoint. This results in much needed economies of 
            scale and scope,” he says. <br>
            <br>
            According to Dr Kalmoor, the achieved scale of operations have also 
            helped build confidence of investors, bankers and customers within 
            the country, as well as players outside. While clearly, achieving 
            economies was one of the objectives, the moot question for Bank 
            Sohar, would be whether it has achieved that critical mass. “We 
            believe that we have achieved the critical mass. We are now number 
            four, across the banking sector for loans and branches and number 
            five as far as assets are concerned. We were able to achieve this 
            within a short period of time,” says the CEO. <br>

            2008, the bank built a total customer credit exposure of RO644mn and 
            customer deposits of RO638mn servicing a total of 42,571 customers. 
            The savings deposits have built up to RO74mn. Bank Sohar was able to 
            increase its market share consistently during the year and has 
            closed the year with 6.64 per cent of private sector credit and 6.77 
            per cent of private sector deposits as computed with industry data 
            for November 2008. The reasons for a good financial performance, has 
            been manifold. These include: a right strategy, right people and a 
            customer driven attitude. “Everything starts with strategy. We 
            understood the market dynamics, the landscape within which we were 
            operating and then positioned ourselves, in a manner that enabled us 
            to achieve our objectives.&nbsp; Also, we had the right people, with the 
            right expertise and right mindset. We went in for products that were 
            in line with the desire of the customers,” says Dr Kalmoor.&nbsp;

            clearly, the phase of achieving economies of scale and scope at Bank 
            Sohar has been completed, the bank is now looking at consolidation 
            and other areas of operations. “It’s not that size is not important, 
            but we are now looking at diversity. Our attention now is towards 
            that,” says Dr Kalmoor. The bank is looking at a host of areas to 
            grow. On the liability side, it is focusing on the composition of 
            deposits, particularly low cost ones. <br>
            <br>
            Banks 
            need to balance high risk and returns, to save against a 
            deterioration in the quality of assets. However, the Bank Sohar CEO 
            is confident with the present quality of assets. “Our assets quality 
            remains healthy. On the corporate side, it was not a question of 
            going in for customers who did not find any lenders. Our portfolio 
            is mostly populated with high networth customers and large 
            corporate. We have never compromised with credit risks. 
            Unfortunately, people think that because we grew very fast, we must 
            have taken high risk assets. I don’t understand why that should be 
            the case.&nbsp; Why can’t one take the view that growth and penetration 
            can be had on the back of competitive advantages. It is possible to 
            penetrate the market, without compromising on risks,” says Dr 
            Kalmoor. <br>
            <br>
            The last 
            two years, have seen a sharp growth. However, the bank does not 
            intend to match the same growth in the years to come. “This is a 
            year of consolidation. We do not wish to see the same growth that 
            took place in the initial two years. We started from zero, in order 
            to achieve the critical mass that was needed. Growth this year will 
            be&nbsp; more tempered,” Dr Kalmoor states.<br>

            <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While, 
            the global economic conditions remain precarious, Bank Sohar is 
            expected to withstand the challenges. The CEO remains optimistic 
            that Bank Sohar would report net profits this year. “In Oman, we 
            have been impacted relatively less. I think the issues facing the 
            Omani economy, has been the twin markets of real estate and stock 
            markets. The real estate market had shot-up, owing to speculation. 
            The international environment also punctured the real estate and the 
            stimulus from private players, has thereby weakened,” says Dr 
            Kalmoor. According to him, the impact on banks has been in terms of 
            impairment of investments; and local banks reliance on foreign banks 
            for dollar funding, which has dried-up. <br>
            <br>
            Clearly, 
            Bank Sohar has had a good performance, considering that it has been 
            a newcomer to the market. With a clear strategy on consolidation, 
            the bank is expected to continue its strong presence.</font></p>

            merely a mortgage bank, to a full-fledged commercial bank – it’s 
            been a metamorphosis of sorts at Ahli Bank. Alliance Housing Bank, 
            as Ahli Bank was called before its transformation on January 5, 
            2008, operated merely as a housing bank, with the balance sheet on 
            the assets side hardly diversified. Understanding the systematic 
            risks associated with merely one area of operation, the bank decided 
            to convert itself into a full-fledged commercial bank and 
            rechristened itself as Ahli Bank. As a consequence, Ahli United Bank 
            BSC picked a 35 per cent equity stake in the bank. <br>
            <br>
            “A few 
            years back, as Alliance Housing Bank, we appointed KPMG to help 
            analyse planned diversification. We had different options, like 
            continuing as a mortgage bank, or a full-fledged commercial bank 
            without a strategic partner or conversion to a commercial bank with 
            a strategic partner. After careful consideration the board decided 
            to choose the latter, after thwarting a takeover bid from BankMuscat,” 
            says AbdulAziz M Al Balushi, Chief Executive Officer of Ahli Bank.<br>
            <br>
            According to Al Balushi, there were several reasons for choosing 
            Ahli United Bank.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            “At that 
            point in time, the board looked at all options. Firstly, Ahli United 
            Bank made the best possible offer. Moreover, if we were to merge 
            with BankMuscat, there would be no fresh liquidity into the system. 
            Ahli United Bank brought fresh liquidity and along with it fresh 
            employment opportunities and a wider array of products to the 
            market,” he says. While Ahli United Bank has a 35 per cent stake in 
            the bank, the remaining 9.99 per cent is held by IFC Washington. <br>
            <br>
            <font color="#CC3300"><b>The 
            initial challenges </b></font><br>
            The last 
            couple of years have seen several challenges at Ahli Bank. Since 
            June of last year all the products and processes have changed and 
            the bank has geared itself, to meet the challenges of the market 
            place. “We had many challenges during the initial phase of business 
            activities. The challenge was in systems, procedures, people, adding 
            more banking products, rebranding and addition of branches. For a 
            new bank it is even easier. For us, we had to interface existing 
            products and transfer data. Some banks take two years to do it, we 
            took only three months,” says Al Balushi. <br>
            <br>
            Pertinently, despite the transition the bank has reported a sharp 
            growth in net profits, especially considering it is a fledgling to 
            commercial banking products and services. Not only has net profits 
            catapulted in comparison to previous years, the asset portfolio has 
            been balanced and the non-performing assets are down to negligible 
            levels. Net profits for the year ended 31st December 2008 have grown 
            by a whopping 167 per cent, while loans and advances for the same 
            period grew by a robust 57 per cent. The commendable financial 
            performance has been attributed to several reasons.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;“We 
            realised that there was a mismatch between deposits and advances. We 
            grew deposits by 110 per cent, while simultaneously adopting prudent 
            measures. We were allowed to invest in equity and real estate, but 
            we decided to stay away. As of today, we do not have any exposure in 
            equity – direct or indirect. We were also conservative in lending to 
            non residents. Within one year we changed our portfolio from merely 
            mortgage loans, which was 100 per to about 40 per cent; as such we 
            diversified our risk,” says Al Balushi. <br>
            <br>
            Among 
            the other aspects that led to the stellar financial performance was 
            a change in the systems. The bank has also managed to grow its fee 
            based income, which would remain a key area going forward.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            “Our 
            strategy was to grow the fee based income which should not be less 
            than 30 per cent of total income. Last year the fee based income has 
            grown substantially. Our non performing assets (NPA) were the best, 
            if not in the Middle East, then at least in the GCC region. NPA’s 
            were 0.19 per cent which is almost negligible. We are conservative 
            as a bank, but, when I say conservative, I do not mean that we don’t 
            lend. We look at opportunities, while weighing risks,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            And sure 
            enough the bank is conservative, as can be gauged from their 
            investment portfolio which is strongly aligned towards risk free 
            investments. Presently, 95 per cent of investments comprise 
            sovereign instruments and the remaining five per cent fixed income 
            securities. <br>
            <br>
            According to Al Balushi, the exposure to other forms of assets may 
            increase, however, for that to happen the bank would wait for an 
            opportune time. Besides, investments in high risk-reward instruments 
            would happen in proportion to increase in the size of its balance 
            sheet.</font></p>

            forward</b></font><br>
            The 
            management of the bank is clear on where the future lies and the 
            areas for sustained growth and profitability. “Every business to be 
            successful has to have a strategy and mission. What is important for 
            us, three years down the line, is to achieve 10 to 15 per cent 
            market share, while ensuring that the return to shareholders is not 
            less than 20 per cent. While on the non financial side we want 
            customers to consider us as the best bank in Oman. In terms of 
            employees the attrition rate should be zero for performing 
            employees. As far as service is concerned we would like to have the 
            best possible products,” says Al Balushi. <br>
            <br>
            With the 
            challenges of deteriorating economic conditions around the globe, 
            problems are manifold, and Oman is not completely decoupled from the 
            global problems. “The big thing is to mitigate risks as far as 
            possible. It may be some problem elsewhere that might surface. But 
            we are not an island, and it could boil down to us,” says Al Balushi.
            <br>
            <br>
            According to him, the other challenge would be to grow the deposit 
            base. The erstwhile Alliance Housing Bank had no deposits and 
            depended on the interbank market. “We have already witnessed a sharp 
            increase in our deposit base. A challenge would be to continue to 
            grow this deposit base substantially,” says Al Balushi. <br>
            <br>
            One of 
            the advantages that Ahli Bank does possess in meeting challenges, is 
            the strong promoters in Ahli United Bank, which has a good presence 
            in the Middle East Region. In the past, the promoters have helped in 
            adding new systems and bringing on loads of expertise to Ahli Bank. 
            Going forward,&nbsp; the bank is able to use the synergy that might arise 
            in underwriting deals for cross border transactions etc.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            While 
            clearly, Ahli Bank is a novice as far as full-fledged commercial 
            banking operations is concerned, it’s been a commendable performance 
            since transformation. With strong promoters and a sound management 
            team, the bank is expected to perform well in the coming years.&nbsp;

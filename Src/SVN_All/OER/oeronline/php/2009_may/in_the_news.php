            Global warming, acid rain, ozone depletion, coral life degradation, 
            carbon emissions, draughts, wildlife fires… the catastrophic 
            consequences of human apathy and neglect towards the environment can 
            go on and on. As the world wakes up to the follies of mankind, Going 
            Green has become the global metaphor to save the world from the 
            deleterious effects of industrialisation and modernisation. Economic 
            experts have suggested that creating a green economy is going to top 
            the agenda of most corporates by the turn of this decade as every 
            company worth its salt strives to contribute its mite to protect and 
            restore what is left of the Earth and our environment. <br>

            Oman Economic Review Green Awards (OERGA) 2009 is an effort to raise 
            consciousness about environment protection and sustainable 
            development in the Sultanate. As the country’s first Environmental 
            Awards, OERGA is a call to action for behavioural change to save 
            planet earth for the generations to come. <br>
            <br>
            Born out of the unwavering belief that our Earth is a shared 
            resource and therefore a shared responsibility, these awards will 
            recognise and promote voluntary contributions across a broad 
            spectrum of activities both from individuals and companies. Says 
            Sandeep Sehgal, CEO, United Media Services, “OERGA will raise 
            awareness about the green issues facing the Sultanate and will 
            provide a good opportunity to showcase the positive commitments of 
            Oman’s corporate world to this country and its people, culture and 
            environment. It will also highlight the moral responsibility being 
            shared by every company and individual towards this precious planet 
            that we call earth.” Businesses – large and small; institutions – 
            educational, health, or governmental; and individuals – 
            independently or as leaders of a collective whole, all play a 
            crucial role in environmental protection and preservation. OER Green 
            Awards 2009 is a platform to honour and appreciate such outstanding 
            environmental vision, endeavours, initiatives and achievements.<br>

            While the misdeeds of the past cannot be undone, we can certainly 
            join hands to save our future. For further information visit

            The Culinary Guild of Oman held its second ever meeting at the 
            Crowne Plaza hotel on April 18. Present at the meeting were some of 
            the best chefs in Oman from various leading companies and 
            restaurants, including Al Bustan Palace Hotel, Intercontinental 
            Muscat, Oman Air and more. The primary objective of the conference 
            was to set the foundation for the first ever Chefs Guild in Oman. 
            United Media Services is a strategic partner of Oman’s Chef Society. 
            One of the key points discussed was the way chefs were viewed by 
            society at large. The consensus was that chefs were seen as mere 
            cooks and it was imperative that they got the recognition they 
            deserved. It was felt that this would go a long way to help smaller 
            restaurants gain respectability. Another key point was to involve 
            the guild strongly with various colleges and institutions and to 
            assist them in bridging the gap between a professional chef’s 
            expectations and the college curriculum.</font></p>

                by Future Match Human Resources Consultancy (FMHRC) to its 
                clients?</b><br>
                Broadly we provide three services. One, being a consultancy firm 
                we do all HR interventions on behalf of our clients. Second, is 
                providing leadership and sales consultancy work. We are a 
                licensee of Predictive Index (PI), a renowned assessment tool in 
                the GCC. PI offers a wide selection of programmes that assess 
                personalities and measures people’s work related behaviour and 
                their motivating needs. The tool takes out the guess work out of 
                the process making it more scientific. PI worldwide is a 
                53-year-old company with a rooster of 7,500 clients out of which 
                76 are Fortune 500 companies. There are companies in the market 
                which provide either training or assessment, but we have a 
                system that bridges the two competencies and provide tailormade 
                solutions that fit the company’s exact needs. Third, we do 
                executive search for our clients focussing on senior management 
                and specialised positions. </font> <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
                <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What are your strengths as an 
                HR consultancy firm?</b><br>
                Though we have an international product and know-how, we also 
                have an understanding of the local market, being close to the 
                local culture our consultancy has a practical edge. We have four 
                consultants whose job is only to service clients and to solve 
                their problems. Our success lies in the success of our clients. 
                To give you an example, we worked with an electricity company 
                which got privatised as a result of the unbundling of the 
                sector. The challenge was to implement a private business model, 
                in an organisation which had a public sector ethos. We explained 
                to the concerned ministry that the people within the 
                organisation will need a certain transition time to adapt to the 
                new culture. Over time the requisite changes came about. This 
                was largely because of the local understanding that we had.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <img border="0" src="consultancy1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="148"><b>Though most companies talk 
                about people as their biggest strength, are they ready to make 
                the requisite investments to develop their HR capabilities?</b><br>
                We do not hear the same message across the board. The government 
                talks about developing its HR, but when it comes to 
                implementation there is still a lot that needs to be done. In 
                the private sector there are banks and oil companies which have 
                well developed HR systems, but in a number of other companies we 
                find that though people are given titles like HR head, but they 
                continue handling chores like leave applications and salary 
                transfers. Though people talk about HR as assets and partners, 
                when it comes to investing in scientific training, they are not 
                ready to spend. Companies spend thousands on cleaning windows 
                and drapes, but not on their people. We live in an information 
                age but companies continue managing their human resources as if 
                they were in an industrial era. So there is a need for a major 
                mindset change. Twenty or 30 years ago, employees looked for 
                companies that paid them a good package, but today’s employee 
                expects&nbsp; the company to provide them with learning and 
                development opportunities, career progression opportunities and 
                coaching and mentoring.&nbsp;In most cases, if they don’t get it, 
                they will turn to companies that will provide them with such 
                opportunities.&nbsp;<br>

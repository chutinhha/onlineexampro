                  this market the same year the MINI brand celebrates its 50th 
                  birthday. The new edition to the MINI family boasts of some of 
                  the most advanced and sophisticated suspension technology. 
                  Tougher bodyworks, an invisible rollover bar behind the rear 
                  seats, which can activated in the event of a possible rollover 
                  and strengthened A-pillars make for the best protection 
                  possible in the event of a collision. Even while driving at a 
                  speed of up to 30 km/h, the soft top folds back fully 
                  automatically in just 15 seconds. This is a car simply cut out 
                  for open air driving in any weather condition. It provides the 
                  driver with an unique Openometer which records the time spent

                  new, fourth model series – following the 911, the Boxster/Cayman, 
                  and the Cayenne sports utility – is of great strategic 
                  significance to the Company. Introducing the four-door 
                  Panamera, Porsche is making a strong move into the luxury 
                  performance segment. In this way Porsche is reaching brand-new 
                  groups of customers while at the same time offering existing 
                  customers of the marque a whole new range of options. Apart 
                  from the PDK (Porsche-Doppelkupplungsgetriebe) or 
                  Double-Clutch Gearbox and the first Start-Stop system in 
                  conjunction with automatic transmission, the technical 
                  innovations the Panamera is introducing for the first time in 
                  the luxury performance class include Porsche’s new adaptive 
                  air suspension with additional air volume on-demand in each 
                  spring as well as active aerodynamics featuring a rear spoiler

                  Kia Opirus topped the large car segment in the Strategic 
                  Vision Total Value Index (TVI). “In a tough economic climate 
                  it is good to see that consumers are recognising the Opirus 
                  for everything that it has to offer,” said Michael Sprague, 
                  Vice President of Marketing, Kia Motors America. “Knowing that 
                  the Total Value Index considers not only the overall ownership 
                  experience but also what buyers feel the economic impact of 
                  their purchase will be is a testament to Opirus’ quality and 
                  value.” Strategic Vision calculates the TVI by taking into 
                  consideration statements that owners make about value, 
                  including expected reliability, expected fuel economy, price 
                  paid and expected resale value. They then incorporated the 
                  importance of the variables that make up the ownership 
                  experience.<br>

                    Touching new horizons&nbsp;</font>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>With the deadline for the application of WTO regulations nearing, the pharmaceutical industry in the Middle East and Gulf is undergoing a revolution of sorts. As both the regions witness mushrooming of new companies, Oman takes initiatives to boost its own pharmaceutical industry by establishing a manufacturing unit and formulating a fresh drug policy. OER reports&nbsp;</b></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the Arab world, the pharmaceutical industry, with more than 200 companies, is a complex paradigm composed of stiff competition, escalating trade barriers, and new drug policies. Gripped with an effervescent desire to start its own research and development someday, the industry is caught between rapid self-expansion and a mounting pressure from the multinational companies (MNCs) that are demanding an open drug market, much before the provisions of the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement are applicable. But amidst a host of conflicting issues, a country like Oman is talking about a big industrial change by getting its first pharmaceutical company onstream, and has announced the construction of another two.<br>
                    “Oman, predominantly, has been importing pharmaceutical products from the US and Europe, but for the last few years generic brands from the neighbouring Gulf countries, Egypt, Jordan and India have made a significant dent out here. Ours is the first manufacturing plant that has been built with a total investment of nearly US$25 million and meets the stringent requirements of UK MCA as well as US FDA. We are producing oral solids and liquids in the beta-lactum plants as well as the main plant,” says Suresh Punetha, CEO of National Pharmaceutical Industries (NPI), Oman.<br>
                    As per Punetha, the consumption of pharmaceutical products within the Arab market is around US$6 billion, out of which the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region accounts for US$1.6 billion. “Saudi Arabia has a (private sector) market size of around US$1 billion, followed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at US$350 million, Kuwait - US$160 million, Qatar - US$80 million, Oman - US$ 60million, and Bahrain - US$30 million,” he says.&nbsp;<br>
                    While Saudi has the largest number of generic brand manufactures such as Spimaco, Tabuk, Al Jazeera, Dar al Dawa, and Riyad Pharma, UAE’s flag is held high by Julphar, in Kuwait there is Kepisco, and in Oman there is NPI. So far, Qatar and Bahrain do not boast of any significant manufacturing facilities. Also, new manufacturers each are expected to venture into UAE and Oman respectively. Julphar is planning to put up another unit within UAE and is one Gulf company that has been performing consistently well. The company, in all has five plants - three in UAE, one in Germany, and one in Ecuador. In UAE, a new US$14 million plant has been built in the form of a joint venture, and in Oman another manufacturing unit called the Oman Pharmaceutical Products Company (OPPC) is in the offing at the Raysut Industrial Estate in Salalah. In addition, one more pharmaceutical plant is expected at Nizwa, where already a formulation unit named Nizwa Pharmaceutical Industry exists.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="../../images/2002_may/pillsinhand.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="147"> OPPC is a 100 per cent subsidiary of the Ajay Group of Industries that has selected the southern city for its location, keeping in mind Salalah Port’s growing importance and the potential of the free trade zone around it.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    OPPC is expected to produce hormones, calcium supplants, antacids, painkillers and antibiotics. The factory, being built at a cost of RO10 million, has a technical collaborator by the name of Elder Pharmaceuticals in India. “Elder will provide us the manufacturing process know-how, but we’re looking at many parties in Europe for a product-wise collaboration,” says general manager Rajendra Bhandari in an interview to a local daily. Bhandari estimates a 10 per cent annual expansion of the Gulf market.&nbsp;<br>
                    “OPPC’s tentative production breakdown is: tablets - 800 million, capsules - 300 million, and ointment tubes and liquid bottles - 20 million each. The raw materials will be imported from approved sources in Europe, India, the US and China,” says Bhandari, and expects calcium supplements and hormones to be among the fast-selling items.<br>
                    Striking a different note, Punetha of NPI informs that the market size of pharmaceutical formulations in Oman is approximately USD 60 million, and around 80-90 per cent purchases are done through floated tenders by various institutions.&nbsp;</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Talking about the entire Arab world, Jordan and Egypt are over 90 per cent self sufficient in terms of pharmaceutical products, whereas the rest of the countries are producing less than 20 per cent of their requirements. The Egyptian drug industry is the largest producer and consumer of pharmaceuticals in the Middle East and North Africa region. Valued at US$1.5 billion in 2000, the Egyptian drug market has grown over the past decade, with the local consumption rising at an annual rate of 14 per cent. Thirty pharmaceutical companies currently serve Egypt’s 69 million population, eight of which are public and the rest privately owned. Local production currently satisfies approximately 94 per cent of the local market’s demand.&nbsp;<br>
                    In Jordan, the pharmaceutical industry is second only to the mining industry in terms of export earnings. In the year 2000, exports exceeded US$175 million dollars and reached more than 60 markets worldwide. For the past 40 years the Jordanian industry has grown to 17 companies and has become export driven. With a capital investment of over US$400 million the pharmaceutical industry has become an important source of foreign currency. With 70 per cent of its sales accruing from exports, the domestic pharmaceutical industry meets more than 40 per cent of the demands of the domestic market by value and more than 60 per cent by units.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Competition and markets</b><br>
                    Rising competition remains a major issue facing the Arab pharmaceutical industry, as it shuns the prospects in the regional as well as potential global markets. In addition to this, most of the companies in the Arab countries rely on foreign markets for their raw materials. Reports suggests that 90 per cent of the raw material used by the local pharmaceutical companies is imported from outside the Arab nations.<br>
                    Furthermore, the operating pharmaceutical plants lack adequate scientific research and development centres. Today, the combined efforts of all the pharmaceutical factories in the Arab world are still incapable of financing the development of a single pharmaceutical prescription, with an estimated price tag of US$410 million. In Egypt alone, with local drug industry focusing on manufacturing rather than on research, 85 per cent of the raw materials are imported from France, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom.<br>
                    Official sources have estimated the average per capita annual spending on pharmaceuticals in the Gulf states at US$60. Recently published statistics estimate the output of the total Arab pharmaceuticals industry at US$6 billion, employing more than 70,000 workers and specialists.<br>
                    By far the GCC market is clearly bifurcated into government and private business. The government institutions, of course, are the major market because healthcare is free for most of the Gulf countries and the private market caters mainly for expatriates and those citizens who do not wish to avail government hospital facilities. As per an industry source, in Oman the total pharmaceutical market is divided between the government sector - 70 per cent and private sector - 30 per cent. In Bahrain the market is almost equal for both the sectors - 50 per cent each, for Qatar, government business constitutes 64 per cent, whereas private sector forms 36 per cent, in Kuwait government accounts for 65 per cent, private - 35 per cent, and in UAE, the government business is around 45 per cent and private - 55 per cent.<br>
                    The marked increase of pharmaceutical business in the private sector of UAE is due to the fact that the country has recently decided not to provide any more free medical assistance to the expatriates. Naturally, this has affected the insurance business in the UAE, as medical premiums have risen on an average 25-30 percent in 2001 owing to rising expensive medical claims. Also, it may be worthy to note that over 80 per cent of the UAE population is expatriate. “Market trends are slowly changing. Saudi Arabia and UAE have a significant private market. In Oman too, private sector is being encouraged to invest more in the health care sector,” says Punetha.&nbsp;<br>
                    Moreover, a recently published survey estimated that the Saudi Arabia’s private health market, presently valued at US$1.06 billion per annum, is expected to grow to US$3.46 billion in the next two to three years. This expansion is inclined to occur following the imposing of the cooperative health insurance system on expatriates. Official sources have reported that 80 private hospitals are presently operating in Saudi Arabia. The total investments in these hospitals are valued at US$1.6 billion. The Saudi state and military hospitals have recently begun to receive patients both through the local insurance companies as well as directly. Unlike the private hospitals, the state-owned and military hospitals usually do not operate on the basis of profits, losses and costs, thus offering medical and health services for relatively low fees.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The pharmacy factor</b><br>
                    As far as pharmacies are concerned, Oman has a total of 300 pharmacies, Bahrain has 65, Qatar has 95, Kuwait has 170, and UAE has a total of 600. There are more than 3,000 pharmacies in Saudi Arabia, which on an average sell US$266 million worth of pharmaceutical products annually. And in Oman, pharmacies sell around US$17 million worth of pharmaceutical products, with the largest network being that of Muscat Pharmacy. Generally, pharmacies in most of the Gulf countries do participate in government tenders besides running their private sales outlets.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Pricing and internal developments</b><br>
                    The cash-rich Middle East and Gulf countries, for long had been the target of the European and American multinationals, which have established their pathway through local agents. But things started changing in the local market at the advent of patent and intellectual property regulations under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Even today, almost all the Arab world countries prefer to register non-patented drugs from an MNC instead of patented ones, simply because of the royalty factors. Observes an industry source, “The respective governments of the Gulf countries have been paying a huge price to import pharmaceutical products. It makes every sense for a country like Oman to have its own production unit as this will save enormous costs for the government in the long run.”<br>
                    Recently, Oman followed its Gulf neighbours and formulated consumer-friendly drug policy that aims to reduce the prices of medical products, and at the same time establish a price control regime.<br>
                    Presently, the annual pharmaceutical import in the Sultanate is estimated at RO26 million, with the government providing free healthcare to Omani citizens, procurement of medicines is done through joint tenders floated by the GCC states. For emergency requirements, local pharmaceutical distributors directly supply to government hospitals. The GCC states are pursuing a uniform strategy on drug price control in view of joint tenders issued for purchase of pharmaceutical products.&nbsp;<br>
                    The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Oman has issued a decision in October 2001, defining the registration of pharmaceutical companies, products and pricing. According to the decision, a drug can be registered only after furnishing details about its ex-factory, wholesale and retail prices in the country of origin. A product’s suggested export price in the currency of the country of origin as well as in US dollars will have to be indicated, besides export prices in the GCC states. After weighing all these factors, the ministry fixes the prices, which are marked on the packaging of products. “Most of the Gulf countries has price controls, and Oman has followed suit. The private customers who form a small market have been benefited significantly,” explains Punetha.<br>
                    It might be worthwhile to note here that although the GCC countries are moving towards economic integration, and customs union is something that has been looked at immediately, not all of them have the same structure. For instance, Oman and Bahrain charge five per cent customs duty, while Qatar and Kuwait have a four per cent duty, and UAE zero per cent. Moreover, Oman provides a 10 per cent price preference to Omani nationals for local goods and services. Additionally, the government considers quality of product or service and support as well as cost in evaluating bids. For most major tenders, the country typically notifies firms either already registered in Oman or pre-selected by project consultants.<br>
                    “As far as registration of foreign products in Oman is concerned,” a source observes, “there is a condition that the same products should have been registered in UAE earlier. And if one has to register its products in UAE, then, as per the rules those products must already be selling in a minimum of two European markets already. Well, the aforesaid rules might sound stringent, but these are the ways of protecting one’s industries.”<br>
                    In a statement issued last year by the Saudi Ministry of Health, annual medicine imports of the Saudi National Guard hospitals, military and private sector hospitals reached up to US$606 million. The Saudi government supports the private sector to invest in establishing medicine production facilities and in developing medical plants. “Locally produced medicines have the same quality as imported ones, due to the existence of statutes that ensure the safety and effectiveness of a medicinal product,” says the statement. International companies wishing to introduce drugs and pharmaceuticals or herbal medicines must register them with the ministry prior to placing them on the market. The registration must be done through a local Saudi agent, and the duration of the process varies from six to 18 months.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Middle East and the WTO</b><br>
                    A big problem, at the moment, bothering the MNCs, in dealing with most of the Middle East and Gulf countries is the issue of intellectual property rights. Of the GCC countries, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE, are already members of the WTO. All four of these countries entered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO under simplified procedures and with minimal negotiations. Saudi Arabia applied for WTO membership in 1993, and converted this application to WTO accession early in 1996. An observer to the WTO since April 1995, Oman now has joined the organisation.<br>
                    Although the GCC and its member countries lack comprehensive rules and regulations to ensure effective intellectual property protection, some progress has been made in the recent years. Saudi Arabia enacted patent and copyright laws in 1989, the UAE enacted copyright, trademark, and patent laws in 1992, Bahrain enacted copyright law in 1993, and Oman has enacted a copyright law in 2000. The GCC secretariat has declared the protection of intellectual property rights to be a priority and is working to facilitate this in the six member states, especially in the area of patent protection.<br>
                    In the context of the pharmaceutical industry in Gulf, the issue of intellectual property assumes significance, since it tends to affect the sector in a big way. Not long ago, Oman had held an international seminar on the subject of intellectual property rights, and the outcome was quite positive. But as mentioned earlier, the very dynamics of the market force the local companies to take a different stand and manufacture the drugs within their own countries, and keep their costs low.<br>
                    <img border="0" src="../../images/2002_may/lion_Biotech-laboratories.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="225" height="179">Finally, the fate of the pharmaceutical industry in the Arab world depends on the turn the government policies of the individual countries take. For instance, there is a news that Saudi Arabia is considering making medical insurance compulsory for its expatriate population, and there are rumours that Oman may think of such a step too. Decisions like these do affect the intrinsic elements of the health care industry and may influence long-term changes in its structure, which ultimately may result in a change within the pharmaceutical industry. As more and more Arab nations adopt free-market principles, marked changes are bound to happen in the health care sector, and this in turn will define a new way of doing business for the pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp;<br>

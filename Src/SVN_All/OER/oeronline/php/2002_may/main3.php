You’re now thinking about putting your money somewhere else, right? Residential property may unleash the long-term rewards you desire without necessarily taking huge risks or having to make difficult decisions, according to industry officials.&nbsp;<br>
                    While land values have significantly increased in Oman during the last decade, the residential property market has not been particularly buoyant for the past three years. But the consensus in the industry seemingly suggests a bullish outlook. Properties in Muscat offer a high regular income from letting, and property buyers have the chance to gain a small capital appreciation in a few areas. This return on investment may increase dramatically if the property market finally opens up to expatriates and foreign institutions. Above all, the property market is highly regarded as a safe and stable investment in the midst of uncertainty with volatile stock, gold and oil markets following September 11. The property market is unlikely to crash because interest rates have been relatively low for sometime. This has made the cost of borrowing considerably cheap which could ultimately stimulate property transactions across the Gulf.&nbsp;<br>
                    “The gap between the cost of borrowing and the cost of lending in Oman is one of the biggest in the world. There is a wide disparity. Therefore, locals are investing in property where they can get a good return on investment. Anyone with money seems to want to put it into property to achieve that magical ten per cent return they are looking for,” says Christopher Steel of Hamptons International.<br>
                    Adnan Haider Darwish, acting general manager of Oman Housing Bank (OHB), agrees, saying: “There is about an eight per cent rate of return on property these days and over the long term this figure could reach ten per cent - especially in Muscat - because of rising property demand due to population growth.”&nbsp;<br>
                    “Though the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) currently offers some reasonable stocks below book value, Omanis must also consider buying property, purchasing bonds and putting some money in savings schemes,” he adds.<br>
                    There’s no doubt that the requirements of the country’s younger generation are changing fast but family tradition is still a factor in determining the demand-supply situation in the housing market. “Typically, three generations of a family live on one property and children stay at home until they are in a position to buy their own house,” says Laurie Cowell, general manager of Alliance Housing Bank (AHB). This fact is reflected by official statistics of the Sultanate’s Ministry of National Economy, published recently in the Central Bank of Oman’s Al-Markazi gazette.&nbsp;<br>
                    Oman’s average household size is estimated to be around 8.5 persons. There is a growing evidence to suggest that this figure will significantly decrease within the next few years as young Omanis decide to flutter away sooner from the family nest because of changes in lifestyle, improved finance options and a wider choice of properties.<br>
                    “This trend is more true in Muscat than other cities in the Sultanate where traditional models of lifestyle exist and are more resistant to change,” adds Cowell. Indeed, in Muscat the average household size is thought to be 7.9 persons while in Dhofar the average is 9.7 persons. In comparison, the average size of an expatriate family living in the Sultanate is only 3.1 persons.&nbsp;

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
                    The Sultanate has 289,339 households in total, and Omani families living in urban areas amount to around 69 per cent while the remaining 31 per cent are classified as having a house in rural areas. Some 86 per cent of Omanis own the houses they live in while 11.2 per cent live in rented accommodation.<br>
                    Yet, about 56 per cent of the 85,919 expatriate families in the country live in houses provided by their employers while another 42 per cent of expatriates working in Oman directly rent property themselves. Most expatriate looking to buy a property in the Sultanate have to wait. There are some indications that a relaxation of the rule preventing foreigners buying property outright is in the offing. Property investors from outside the Gulf have access to some one-off exceptions to this rule. Oman opened up its real estate market for investment to Gulf nationals in early 2000 with an expectation that the property market will move upwards. Although this has so far failed to pick up, interest from Arabs, with an eye on a holiday home in Muscat, is gradually increasing.&nbsp;<br>
                    “We are involved in the development of a residential area for foreign ownership,” says Cluttons’ general manager Michael Lowes, who prefers not to name the project though he says its not the new golf course planned close to the airport or the Shangri-La resort, both of which are offering villas with long-term leases to foreigners. “A suitable property investment atmosphere would be aided by the implementation of relevant laws, systems and administrative procedures in place to welcome investors. There still needs to be a lease structure and a legal framework in place while estate management of such projects would also need some attention to reassure potential customers.” Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have recently followed Dubai and Bahrain to allow outright property purchases by foreigners.<br>
                    To a great extent, property let in the Sultanate to expatriates tends to drive capital values, particularly in traditionally attractive rentable areas like Qurum. “The movement in the market is largely defined by the expatriate lettings across all sectors from the one-bedroom flats in Wadi Al Kabir to much sought after villas in Shati Al Qurum,” adds Steel.&nbsp;<br>
                    When looking at property lettings, there is an outward geographic shift where residents prefer to live in villas located in Azaiba and Ghubra where new accommodation can be rented for the same price as older stock in the traditional areas of Medinat Sultan Qaboos and Qurum. There has been a trend of redeveloping older properties in this area causing an uptrend in land values while new developments face a challenge in securing a return on investment within an acceptable timeframe from completion. Property developed specifically to cater towards the expatriate rental segment sells faster than older poorly maintained lettings which can actually erode in value.&nbsp;<br>
                    According to Hamptons, two-bedroom apartments can offer notable returns. For example, by renting this type of letting in Oman’s prime residential area - Shati Al Qurum - locals can produce an annual yield of RO4,200 (US$10,920). Moreover, a four-bedroom villa rented in the Qurum area can earn an annual income of RO9,600 (US$24,960). This extra revenue may seem low when comparing rents for similar-sized flats in prime locations of other international cities but it’s huge when you consider that this is over 64 per cent of the estimated average annual income of an Omani national, some RO5,148 (US$13,384). Having said this, properties in this bracket fetch an average price of about RO70,000 (US$182,000) which the average local entrepreneur may not be able to afford although housing loans above this amount are available in the market.&nbsp;<br>
                    Looking at the overall level of borrowing against GDP per capita, the general perception is that borrowing is high but it is not clear how much of this debt is related to housing and what constitutes other goods and household facilities purchased such as private vehicles, holidays, medical treatment and mobiles, opines Cowell.<br>
                    “My personal belief is that housing is certainly the largest single element in individuals’ private loans. There is also a general tendency in Oman for people to borrow much more on personal consumer goods than is generally the case in developed economies,” he adds.<br>
                    This trend is mirrored when looking at consumption patterns, the average family in the Sultanate spends some RO97 (US$252) on housing each month. For the average Omani family this represents 19.5 per cent of average monthly spending while for the average expatriate family this represents about 26.9 per cent of average monthly expenditure.<br>
                    At present, there are many other reasons why people may choose to invest in property and macroeconomic variables play a major role in this. There has been ongoing build-up of activity in the housing market in recent times when you look at the number of families and young people entering the workplace. The increasing new demand for homes is also attributable to factors such as the economy gradually working out the problems of two or three years ago which saw weakness in the MSM. By international standards, the cost of housing construction has also remained low.<br>
                    “The cost of cement, brick and labour tends to be relatively cheap which leads to larger demand for new houses to be built rather than moves to pre-owned property. Therefore, no real inflation has been present in the building industry but there have been some significant changes in land value. Rural areas have tended to be driven by oversupply while urban areas - notably popular areas in Muscat where demand has been steady - have witnessed some land price hikes, says Cowell.<br>
                    In terms of property sales, land prices in Azaiba, Seeb and Al Hail areas have risen because of general population growth in the area and the completion of recreational, medical, school and retailing facilities. The typical purchaser today is prepared to pay a premium for property with an open aspect (views) and is less influenced by the actual building than the plot size, its position and neighbourhood, state Hamptons in a recent property review report. Front row properties with sea frontage command a price that is 10 to 15 per cent higher than lettings out of sea view.&nbsp;<br>
                    Muscat Municipality is aiming to improve infrastructure, and a residential zone adjacent to the airport similar to that established in Shatti Al Qurum will be developed quickly. “Companies developing deluxe and luxury homes and villas in this area would do well as such projects could be highly successful,” forecasts Darwish. “Also, in the future, I believe it is inevitable that we will see more Omanis living in two-bedroom apartments, particularly in Muscat, where it will become increasingly more difficult to build villas and the choices will be fewer.” There isn’t a natural progression whereby an Omani will buy a one-bedroom apartment and work up towards a large three-bedroom or four-bedroom house. The average family tends to wait until they can afford a family home outright.<br>
                    There is a huge business opportunity to establish a house-building company in Muscat, says Lowes. Such a business would eliminate the hassle, time and stress of dealing with contractors and authorities when building a house. “The tradition in Oman is to simply build your own house but in the UK this is very rare and you mostly find people buying off-the-peg, so-to-speak.” An EU study last year found that housing markets in Europe are adopting policies to promote increasing owner-occupation.&nbsp;<br>
                    In the meantime, Oman remains good value for first time buyers and local entrepreneurs alike. The average residential letting that Hamptons deals with is more than RO600 per month. The mid-market price range for the average family in Oman renting a house is between RO500 and RO800 per month for a medium-sized villa, according to Cluttons. You can’t rent any comparable property in any of England’s main cities and even comparable houses in Abu Dhabi and Dubai command much higher rents.&nbsp;<br>
                    The price of a house is dictated by the land it sits on and there is very little value attributable to the concrete structure put up on it. “Generally, if you’re looking at a standard plot in the central area of Qurum, you’re looking at RO70,000-80,000 but we’ve sold larger plots for villa developement at RO400,000-500,000,” says Steel. By and large, in international terms, the Omani real estate market has plenty of bargains on offer and is Ôrelatively cheap’. The average price of a house in Muscat is around RO30,500 (US$79,300).&nbsp;

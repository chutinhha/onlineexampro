                    <br>
                    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tough times prevail for the local banking industry, as banks face an uphill task to clear the heap of bad loans off their books, and return to a robust health. The year 2001 was the most painful year for the industry as the bad loans fiasco weighed down the profitability of most of the Omani banks. In fact, the bad loans were steadily piling up for a long time, and many international banking experts have been critical of how they have dealt with the massive non-performing assets till the last quarter of 2001.&nbsp;<br>
                    For the first time in the history of the country’s banking sector, two banks fell into red. The first bad news that hit the market was the second largest bank’s net loss. National Bank of Oman (NBO), the second largest bank in terms of assets plunged into a RO7.5 million net loss in 2001 as against a net profit of RO8.27 million in the previous year. While the youngest bank, Majan International Bank (MIB) made a net loss of RO7.2 million as against a net profit of RO1.875 million in 2000. In line with the Central Bank of Oman’s (CBO) directives, banks strictly followed the borrower-by-borrower provisioning method.&nbsp;<br>
                    Though BankMuscat, the country’s largest commercial bank in terms of assets made the highest profit at RO7.75 million for FY01, there was a 52 per cent fall compared with RO16.27 million registered in FY00. Oman International Bank (OIB) made the biggest fall. The bank recorded an 80 per cent decline in its net profit at RO1.97 million as against RO9.94 million in FY00.&nbsp;<br>
                    The fourth largest bank, Bank Dhofar, was the only bank to record a growth in net profit. The bank’s net profit increased by 11 per cent to RO6.13 million in FY01 as against RO5.52 in FY00. Oman Arab Bank (OAB), which is regarded as the most conservative bank witnessed a 10 per cent fall in net profit by touching RO6.05 million as against RO6.8 million in 2000, RO76,000 less than Bank Dhofar’s net profit.<br>
                    Undoubtedly, provisioning will restrict the overall profitability of banks for the time being. But, as experts point out, the adequate loan-loss provisioning policies of the banking regulator would ensure the country’s banking system to become more transparent in the years to come.<br>
                    The market had hoped that all banks might skip dividends for the year 2001. However, except those which made losses, others declared dividends. BankMuscat and OIB announced dividends of 10 per cent and five per cent, respectively. Bank Dhofar announced a 10 per cent cash dividend and five per cent bonus and OAB a cash dividend of 20 per cent.&nbsp;</font></p>
                    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="../../images/2002_may/pg26.jpg" width="400" height="229"></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BankMuscat had paid a divided of 20 per cent in 2000. The bank had been paying an average cash dividend of 22.50 per cent since 1997 till 2000-end. Though NBO skipped the dividend for the year 2001, it had been paying out an average cash dividend of 16.25 per cent since 1997. It had paid a cash dividend of 15 per cent for the year 2000. The bank had paid out a total of RO47.5 million in dividends and bonus shares over the past six years.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Bank Dhofar had paid cash dividend of 10 per cent and a stock dividend of five per cent in 2000. The cash dividend for the year 2001 absorbed RO3.4 million. Bank Dhofar’s policy to issue bonus shares and gradually strengthen its capital-base is most encouraging. Though the year passed by was a difficult year for Oman International Bank (OIB), the largest local bank in terms of savings deposits and share capital, it announced a cash dividend of five per cent. The bank had been distributing an average of 11.75 per cent dividend since 1997 till 2000-end. It can be seen from the bank’s previous balance sheets that it has been continuing a practice of declaring the whole profit as dividend for a long time.<br>
                    BankMuscat has provided RO26.1 million provision for bad loans in FY01 as against RO11.81 million in FY00. The bank recovered RO2.58 million from bad loans in 2001 compared with RO1.7 million in 2000. The total non-performing assets (NPAs) as of 2001-end stood at RO113.75 million. Till the end of 2001, the bank had provided over RO83 million, covering 73 per cent of the total bad loans.&nbsp;<br>
                    Though the gross interest income declined by five per cent to RO108.7 million from RO114.6 million, net interest income grew by five per cent to RO49.6 million following an 18 per cent fall in the interest expense. The fall in interest expense is attributed to the fall in interest rates.<br>

The operating cost declined by five per cent to RO27.37 million as against RO28.82 million in FY00, resulting in an increase of 19 per cent in the operating profit at RO34.5 million (RO28.8 million).&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The total assets stood at RO1.35 billion in FY01 as against RO1.34 billion in FY00. However, as of March-end 2002, the assets stood further higher at RO1.45 billion compared with RO1.35 billion as of March-end 2001. The total loans and advances as of 2001-end stood at RO1.09 billion as against RO996.6 million in the preceding year, recording an increase of 10 per cent.&nbsp;<br>

 As of March-end 2002, loans and advances stood higher at RO1.17 billion compared with RO1.039 billion as of March-end 2001, showing an increase of 13 per cent. In 2001, customer deposits grew by five per cent to RO890 million compared with RO849.9 million in FY00. Shareholders’ funds rose by 17 per cent to RO127.13 million compared with RO108.67 million in FY00.

The total interest income declined by 10 per cent to RO25.20 million as against RO28.046 million. However, the net interest income rose by 26 per cent to RO13.78 million as against RO10.93 million. The reason for increase in net interest income was a 39 per cent fall interest expense. The operating profit rose by 47 per cent to RO9.75 million from RO6.65 million. The shareholders’ funds registered an increase of 32 per cent at RO128.27 million as against RO97 million. BankMuscat is set for further growth as it has initiated fresh strategies to expand operations abroad.<br>

                    NBO’s provisions for non-performing loans rose to new high of RO31.51 million in 2001 compared with RO10.5 million in FY00. NBO’s provisions and bad loans stood the highest in the entire banking industry and made a loss of RO7.5 million. The bank had posted net profits of RO13.3 million, RO15 million and RO10.6 million for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The bank posted an operating profit of RO26.6 million as against RO23 million in 2000, an increase of 16 per cent. Of the total RO135 million (2001-end) NPAs, the bank has provided RO101 million till March-end 2002.&nbsp;<br>

                    The net interest income rose by 19 per cent to RO33 million in 2001 compared with RO27.8 million in the previous year. NBO’s total assets rose from RO243 million in 1992 to RO951.4 million in 2001, recording an increase of 16.7 per cent. The total deposits grew from RO442.7 million in FY00 to RO547 million in FY01 and long-term deposits reached RO67.5 million.

The bank had posted the highest net profit of RO16.7 million in 1997 and since 1998, the profit has been showing a declining trend.&nbsp;<br>

The bank continued to remain the largest in terms of low-cost deposits.&nbsp;<br>
                    Though the low-cost deposits were the largest in the banking industry, the total deposits declined by 9.99 per cent to RO489.47 million compared with RO543.857 million in the previous year. The reasons for the fall is because of the 80 per cent fall in certificate of deposits (CD) at RO7.525 million as against RO39.6 million, and a 23.6 per cent fall in time deposits at RO193.97 million compared with RO254 million. The bank has a paid-up capital of RO62.897 million, the highest in the sector. Shareholders’ funds stood at RO87.96 million as against RO94.1 million, a fall of over six per cent. Retained earnings declined from RO9.7 million in 2000 to RO3.17 million in 2001. The earnings per share work out to RO0.031 (RO0.158). In terms of branch network, OIB was the largest bank before the BankMuscat-Commercial Bank merger. The bank has eighty-two branches in Oman and four overseas branches at Mumbai and Kochi in India and Karachi and Lahore in Pakistan. OIB has been functioning without a chief executive (CEO) for a long time.&nbsp;<br>

                    <b>Bank Dhofar</b><br>
                    Bank Dhofar Al Omani Al Fransi was the only local bank, which recorded a growth in net profit for FY01. Though the provisions for bad loans made during the year soared to RO3.8 million as against RO1.16 million in FY00, the bank has registered an 11 per cent jump in its net profit for FY01 at RO6.133 million compared with RO5.528 in FY00.&nbsp;<br>
                    It is encouraging to note that even after providing full provisions against the single largest bad loan exposure, which hit the entire banking sector, Bank Dhofar has reported a considerable growth in net profit. What was more significant was that the bank’s total bad loans as of 2001-end stood only at RO3.6 million, which was of course the lowest in the industry.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Till the end of 2001-end, Bank Dhofar had provided RO14.7 million provisions. During the year under review, the bank’s operating profit rose by 36 per cent to RO10.6 million compared with RO7.8 million in 2000. There was over 41 per cent increase in bank’s net interest income and a nine per cent fall in interest expense. The net interest income rose from RO10.87 million to RO15.39 million in 2001.&nbsp;<br>

The interest expense declined to RO11.44 million in FY01 from RO12.57 million in FY00. Profit before tax (PBT) rose by over eight per cent to RO6.73 million compared with RO6.212 million in FY00.&nbsp;<br>
                    The share capital rose from RO32 million in FY00 to RO33.6 million in FY01 because of the bonus issue. During the year-ended December 31, 2001 the bank issued 1.6 million shares as bonus to the shareholders. The earnings per share (EPS) work out to RO0.18 compared with RO0.17 in FY00 and the book value (BV) per share works out higher at RO1.26 compared with RO1.24. The capital adequacy ratio stands at 13.8 per cent compared with the statutory limit of 12 per cent stipulated by the apex bank.&nbsp;<br>
                    The total assets of the bank stood higher at over RO337 million compared with RO272.5 million, indicating an increase of nearly 24 per cent. Loans and advances rose to RO257.6 million compared with RO212.7 million in the previous year, showing over 21 per cent jump. Deposits grew by over 27 per cent to RO268.4 million compared with RO210.8 million. The low-cost deposit (savings account) soared by nearly 55 per cent to RO31.4 million compared with RO20.32 million. The total shareholders’ equity increased to RO42.65 million compared with RO39.84 million, showing an increase of over seven per cent. Retained earnings increased to RO539,000 from RO140,000.&nbsp;<br>
                    Meanwhile, the proposed merger between Bank Dhofar and Majan International Bank (MIB) looks favourable for Bank Dhofar’s future growth if it pays the right price. Bank Dhofar has a 6.2 per cent stake in MIB. Looking back at the track record, Bank Dhofar has been recording a considerable growth in its overall operations since 1997. Bank Dhofar’s net profit, assets, net interest income, shareholders’ equity, EPS, and book value have grown steadily.<br>
                    During the year under review, the bank acquired 16 branches of erstwhile Commercial Bank of Oman. The goodwill of RO3.5 million on the acquisition is being amortised over a period of 10 years. The bank has amortised RO350,000 during the year 2001. Dhofar International Development &amp; Investment Holding Company holds a 34.3 per cent stake in Bank Dhofar, which according to sources constitutes nearly 67 per cent of the company’s total investments. Lately, BNP Paribas sold off its 6.3 per cent stake in Bank Dhofar as part of the French bank’s worldwide strategy after the September 11 incident. The 2.1 million Bank Dhofar shares were sold to the Civil Service Pension Fund.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Oman Arab Bank (OAB)</b><br>
                    The 17-year old OAB, a member of the Arab Bank Plc. of Jordan has provided RO2.58 million provisions for bad loans as against RO334,000 in the previous year. Arab Bank has a 49 per cent stake in the bank, and Ominvest has a 50.99 per cent stake in the bank. The bad loan provisions provided during the year stood the lowest in the industry. The bank’s competence has been reflected in its performance.&nbsp;<br>
                    Compared to any other bank, its bad loan exposure with the much-publicised local customer was too small to compare, as it stood at a mere RO600,000, and the bank has fully provided for the loan loss. This shows the strength of the bank’s conservative lending polices. The bank has posted a net profit of RO6.05 million for the year FY01 as against RO6.8 million during FY00.&nbsp;<br>
                    The bank’s gross interest income rose by eight per cent to RO24.13 million from RO22.36 million. While the interest expense stood lower at RO10.95 million as against RO11.73 million. Net interest income for the year rose to RO13.18 million as against RO10.63 million in the previous year. The net operating income increased by 20 per cent to RO18.7 million from RO15.6 million in 2000. Total operating profit rose by 39 per cent to RO10.4 million compared with RO7.5 million in FY00.&nbsp;<br>
                    Total assets increased to RO320.09 million from RO276.22 million, showing an increase of 16 per cent. Loans and advances rose to RO230.7 million compared with RO227.4 million. The customer deposits increased to RO240.45 million compared with RO207.49 million in FY00, showing an increase of nearly 16 per cent.&nbsp;<br>
                    OAB’s low cost deposits (savings account) soared by about 51 per cent to RO43.15 million as against RO28.59 million in FY00. The total shareholders’ funds rose RO39.15 million compared with RO38.42 million in FY00, showing an increase of 6.96 per cent. The year 2001 was a successful year for OAB when it comes to project financing as it was associated with the Barka Power Station, Barka Water Transmission, Al Kamil Power Station, Ghubra Desalination Projects etc.<br>
                    To sum up, the stringent provisioning has prevented banks from distributing unearned profits in the form of dividends, while provisions set off against profits are retained in the system, to act as a cushion against any potential loan losses. The high cost of providing provisions against bad loans has weakened the profitablity of banks. This, as market experts believe may clean up banks’ balance sheets in the coming years. with increased trade liberalisation, banks will have to equip themselves to deal with a more competitive regional and domestic environment as the emerging focus is largely based on serving consumers’ needs. Besides provisioning being a constraint, the business environment in the past was somewhat bleak due to slow down in the global economy.&nbsp;<br>
                    It is worth mentioning that banks have adequately built the necessary reserves, both in terms of statutory as well as regulatory. Therefore, the capital currently maintained by the banks in general is considered to be adequate to meet any impairment in the system. The market is optimistic about the future of Oman’s banking sector. The optimism, however, comes with a warning that the profitability will continue to remain under pressure if banks fail to safeguard their assets in a prudent manner.&nbsp;<br>
                    The banking regulator should ask banks to step up monitoring of risky clients, and provide loan-loss provisions for companies whose businesses are not picking up. While banks gear up to guard against corporate failures by tightening credit lines, corporate survival could be at stake if banks get burned. Though the year that passed by was the worst, the year 2002, already looks somewhat promising.&nbsp;</font></p>

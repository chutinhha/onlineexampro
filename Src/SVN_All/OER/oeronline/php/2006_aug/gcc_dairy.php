</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">The Blooming Oil Boom</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>World Bank report: Economic growth is on a roll since 2003 — but next year 
the flush may fade for some<br>
</b>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>T</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Combined 
with production increases, rising oil prices have fuelled extraordinary economic 
growth among oil producers including the GCC countries, which recorded an 
average economic growth rate of 6.7 per cent over 2005 and also accounted for 84 
per cent of Middle East and North Africa regional growth last year. The World 
Bank report MENA Economic Developments and Prospects 2006: Financial Markets in 
a New Age of Oil finds that oil producers are increasingly turning finite oil 
wealth into longer-term revenue streams.<br>
<br>
Unlike the earlier boom period, when oil producing countries built up debt and 
banked on continued high oil prices to fuel their expansion, and were 
consequently caught with large debts when the oil price declined, this time, 
says the WB report, these countries are showing tremendous amount of restraint — 
building up savings, paying off debts, and setting up oil stabilisation funds.<br>
<br>
Besides some external debt, the majority of debt is domestic for the GCC 
countries. So, a few countries have utilised the oil wealth to substantially 
draw down their domestic debt obligations. Going by the WB report, Saudi Arabia 
has taken the lead in massive debt repayments. In a span of just three years, it 
has brought down domestic debt from 97 per cent of Gross Domestic Production 
(GDP) in 2002 to just 41 per cent by the end of 2005. Over the same period, it 
turned a fiscal deficit of almost 6 per cent of GDP to a fiscal surplus of 8.4 
per cent by 2005. Debt reductions have also occurred in Kuwait and Oman.<br>
<br>
Fiscal situation: A decade ago the situation was entirely different. Most GCC 
countries faced the problem of heavy fiscal deficits because of lower oil prices 
and production, high imports of goods and services, and war-related payments. 
But the trend is slowly but steadily changing.<br>
<br>
The GCC nations, which control nearly 45 per cent of the world oil deposits, are 
also expected to record the largest external fiscal surplus in 2006. The GCC’s 
current account hit a record US$105.7 billion in 2004, and swelled to US$152 
billion in 2005. In 2006, the balance is projected to hit another record of 
US$172.7 billion before easing to around US$164.9 billion in 2007, as per the 
World Bank report. <br>
<br>
Thanks to the sharp growth in the country’s liquefied natural gas exports, Qatar 
recorded the highest current account surplus of around US$45.6 billion in 2005, 
and is expected post the highest surplus of nearly US$51.7 billion in 2006 and 
US$51.8 billion in 2007. Kuwait comes next with a surplus of US$43.3 billion in 
2005, and expected surpluses of US$49.9 billion and US$48.7 billion in 2006 and 
2007 respectively.<br>
<br>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is also likely to increase its surplus from US$22 
billion to US$27 billion in 2006, but may slip a little to US$26.1 billion in 
2007. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia’s surplus will remain at the same US$28.3 
billion in 2006, and drop down to US$23.9 billion by 2007, predicts the WB 
report.<br>
<br>
Oman is hitting a high fiscal note — US$7 billion surplus in 2005, projected to 
touch US$8.5 billion this year and US$9.4 billion in 2007. For Bahrain, its 
surplus was as high as US$5.8 billion in 2005 and this year’s accrual is 
targetted to be US$7.3 billion. But 2007 may see a lower surplus — around US$5.3 
billion.<br>
<br>
<b>Growth rates:</b> Economic expansion in GCC countries has been impressive, 
averaging more than 7 per cent over the past three years. Saudi Arabia gained 
more than a percentage point in 2005 in comparison to the 2004 growth rate, but 
has not been able to better the 2003 record — an all-time high in 15 years. For 
Kuwait and Qatar, it’s been a bit of a yo-yo over the last three years, but 
growth rate in the UAE seems to have slowed down somewhat.</font></p>

While new finds, enchanced oil recovery methods and a better production capacity 
should help boost GDP growth rate in Oman, says the WB report, Kuwait, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE too are likely to show strong GDP projection for 2006 
and 2007. Real term growth too, for these two years, is projected at 7.3 and 5.3 
per cent in Qatar, 7.1 and 6.3 per cent in Bahrain, 6.6 and 5.2 per cent in the 
UAE, 6.3 and 6.4 per cent in Saudi Arabia, 6.2 and 6.0 per cent in Oman and 6.2 
and 4.7 per cent in Kuwait.<br>
<br>
Oil output expansion: As the World Bank report cites, for the third straight 
year since 2003, crude oil prices rose sharply over 2005 — from an average of 
US$38 a barrel over 2004 to more than US$53 over 2005, an increase of more than 
40 per cent year on year. But this has had no effect on demand which has been 
steadily climbing, resulting in shortages. As a result, countries are making 
efforts to increase their output and expand their resources.<br>
<br>
Among GCC countries, Saudi Arabia has increased its output, over the last three 
years, its output from an average of 7.4 to 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd). 
Kuwait too has gone for a strong production drive, with crude production up by 
33 per cent in the last three years. For Qatar, it’s up by 24 per cent, and 23 
per cent for the UAE. Only Bahrain slumped down its oil production by 10-15 per 
cent over 2005 compared to the 2002 output.<br>
<br>
To meet the constant pressure of increasing demand, the GCC nations have been 
investing systematically in explorations and new recovery technologies. Recently 
Kuwait discovered new oil and gas deposits which could boost the country’s 
reserves by some 10 per cent. Saudi Arabia currently produces 11 million bpd of 
heavy crudes — and is planning to produce 12.5 million bpd by 2009, by investing 
heavily in oil field developments.<br>
<br>
Oman, which has heavier crude than its neighbours, has invested heavily in new 
techniques like steam and polymer injection that will boost well production. As 
per Central Bank of Oman Annual Report 2005, Oman’s average daily production 
during 2005 was at about 0.77 million barrels per day. The UAE too has agreed to 
add 200,000 bpd, increasing total production capacity to 2.7 million bpd.<br>
<br>
Widening the scope: High oil prices have jacked up production cost of 
energy-dependent industries like petrochemicals. Globally, the petrochemicals 
industry has grown by four per cent per year over the past two years. For the 
GCC countries, a widening cost advantage has come in handy to bolster their 
petrochemical production facilities. So much so that over the past two years, 90 
per cent or more of the non-oil export growth in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar 
has come from petrochemicals.<br>
<br>
The GCC countries now account for nearly 10 per cent of global production in 
basic petrochemicals such as ethylene. By 2010, these countries are expected to 
provide nearly 50 per cent of the world’s annual new ethylene capacity, and 
account for nearly 20 per cent of total global capacity. <br>
<br>
Saudi Arabia’s petrochemical company SABIC has initiated construction on several 
petrochemical plants that will produce ethylene, ethylene glycol, polyethylene, 
and polypropylene products by 2008. The firm has also joined several 
international firms in expanding or building four additional facilities that 
will produce styrene and olefins which will also come online in 2008.<br>
<br>
Other GCC countries too are investing heavily in petrochemical enterprises. Oman 
has announced plans for a petrochemicals complex, including two methanol plants 
that will produce 2 million tonnes by 2008. Kuwait is expanding its 
petrochemicals production with several new facilities that will be online by 
2007. Qatar is finishing a methanol plant this year, and will add two ethylene 
crackers producing 2.7 million tonnes a year by 2011. The UAE has added another 
ethylene cracker that will be running in 2009. <br>
Exports: Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain more than 
doubled their oil exports in the last three years, growing from a cumulative of 
US$186 billion in 2002 to US$440 billion by 2005.<br>
<br>
Exports of liquid chemicals from the GCC were 16.6 million tonnes in 2004, and 
reached 18.4 million tonnes in 2005. This amount is expected to rise to 32 
million tonnes by 2007, and nearly 48 million tonnes in 2008, as the planned 
petrochemical facilities come on-stream.<br>
<br>
On the future prospectus of the region, the WB report says, hydrocarbon revenues 
are anticipated to remain at quite high levels despite the moderation in oil 
price — easing from US$260 billion in 2005 toward US$225 billion by 2008.<br>
<br>
The WB report concludes that current account surplus is seen to be diminishing 
from about US$185-to US$80 billion, as more of the windfall is expended on 
imports — and the overall fiscal position drops from the current surplus of 21 
per cent of GDP to a still high 15 per cent. <i>— Sowmya Sri Rallabhandi<br>

<br>
<br>
Firmer oil prices were the primary reason for a record trade balance in fiscal 
2005 — nearly 17 per cent of the GDP — which strengthened export receipts and 
caused trade surplus to double to US$2 billion. While the GDP grew by more than 
7 per cent, oil exports rose by a robust 40 per cent, causing total exports to 
rise by more than 33 per cent — US$ 10 billion — including the output from the 
offshore Abu Saafa field (300,000 barrels per day) shared by Bahrain and Saudi 
Arabia.<br>
<br>
<b>Exports</b><br>
The petroleum sector accounted for nearly 78 per cent of total exports in 2005, 
up from 74 per cent in 2004. Yet, the increasing significance of the petroleum 
sector is regarded as a negative development, as it makes Bahrain’s economy only 
more vulnerable to external shocks. Accordingly, this runs contrary to 
government’s stated goal of diversifying the economy away from oil. <br>
<br>
On a separate note, oil revenue accounted for 73 per cent of Bahrain’s treasury 
income in<img border="0" src="gcc_dairy_3.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="109"> 
fiscal year 2005, again due to firmer oil prices. Yet, the petroleum sector 
(crude plus refining) accounts for 20 per cent of the GDP. Bahrain authorities 
generally refer to the share of the petroleum in the GDP, when arguing about the 
limited role of oil in the economy.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, the share of non-oil exports declined from 24 per cent in 2004 
to 20 per cent last year. Non-oil exports (aluminium, ready-made garments and 
chemical products) accounted for 20 per cent of the total exports. Re-export 
accounted for the balance two per cent. The value of re-export merely amounted 
to US$234 million, indicating that Bahrain still has a long way to go to impose 
itself as a base for doing business with regional places.<br>
<br>
<b>Imports</b><img border="0" src="gcc_dairy_5.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="90"><br>
Fiscal 2005 accounted for nearly 22.5 per cent (about US$8 billion) growth in 
imports, mainly on the back of a 50 per cent rise in oil imports. However, 
non-oil imports rose by a mere 3.6 per cent — undoubtedly not commensurate with 
economic growth. Primarily, oil accounted for 52 per cent of total imports in 
2005, up from 43 per cent in 2004. Stronger oil prices increased the 
significance of oil in the import receipt as well.<br>
<br>
Bahrain pays market prices for crude oil purchased from Saudi 
Arabia, and processed in the sole refinery into petroleum products — diesel and 
jet fuel — primarily destined for exports. The Saudi oil is transferred via 
pipelines, thereby saving loading and off-loading costs. However, pipelines are 
several decades old, and are running in areas targetted for urban development. 
The current path of the pipelines could be re-directed, following completion of 
a commissioned study.<i><br>

High oil prices helped Kuwait’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to achieve a growth 
of 35 per cent and totaled US$81 billion in 2005, the National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) 
said. The oil sector recorded a 60 per cent increase. However, growth of non-oil 
sectors has declined — from 17 per cent (2004) to about 10.7 per cent (2005). 
Their contribution to the GDP has also dipped from 50 per cent to 41 per cent. 
However, financial institutions, the leading non-oil sector in the economy in 
terms of contribution to non-oil GDP, recorded a growth of 20 per cent and 
contributed 18.4 per cent of non-oil GDP. But real estate’s contribution to the 
non-oil GDP decreased from 15 per cent in 2002 to 11.7 per cent in 2005.<br>
<br>
While Per Capital Income has gone upto US$34,482 per year, private consumer 
spending has increased by 12.5 per cent — the highest since 1996. But public 
spending, about 4.6 per cent, has remained unchanged for the third consecutive 
year.<br>

The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest report commends that the UAE’s 
medium-term economic outlook remains favourable. Economic growth has been 
impressive — reflecting sharply higher oil prices, increased oil production, 
strong investor confidence, and a significant increase in Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI). But the report also warned about “...a number of risks, 
including price developments in the equity and real estate markets and 
accelerating inflationary pressures, warrant close monitoring.” It pointed out 
that an inflationary cost-push — given the limitations of monetary policy 
resulting from the fixed exchange rate and liberalised capital account — may 
affect public spending too.<br>
<br>
However, the IMF report agrees that the inflationary fallout is likely to be 
absorbed by the comfortable fiscal position (from oil revenue surplus) which 
allows significant accumulation of financial assets’ support to infrastructure 
and social outlays — leading to an overall growth of the economy. Commending the 
country’s pursuit of market friendly policies, an outward-oriented development 
strategy, and prudent financial policies, the IMF report stressed on the 
following factors for future growth:<br>
• Link wage increases to gains in public sector productivity;<br>
• Replace subsidies on water and electricity with income-related payments to 
nationals below a certain income level;<br>
• Start the groundwork for a Value Added Tax (VAT) system at the federal level.<br>
The IMF report recommended the extension of UAE’s investment climate to areas 
outside the free zones, and take steps to encourage more private sector 
participation by passing the amended Company Law, which will allow higher 
foreign investment in the UAE-based companies.<br>
<br>
On the banking sector, IMF cautioned that increased lending for real estate and 
equity financing has led to a rise in credit risk, and stressed that banks’ 
direct and indirect exposure to these markets — and the increased loan 
concentration in a few large business groups — call for close monitoring by the 
central bank.<br>
<br>
The adequacy of prudential regulation should be kept under review, advised the 
IMF report, and banks that recorded significant growth in profits from equity 
markets related activities should be closely supervised.<br>

With a private sector investment of nearly US$8 billion over the next 10 years, 
Prince AbdulAziz Bin Mousaed Economic City at Hail is set to become the largest 
transportation and logistics hub in the Middle East, and open gates for the 
regional and international investors. Planned by the Saudi Arabian General 
Investment Authority (SAGIA), it is the second in a series of economic cities in 
the country — and is expected to exploit the region’s core strengths of 
location, agriculture, mineral deposits, moderate climate and natural beauty. 
The city will be developed by Rakisa Holdings in cooperation with core investors 
including Gulf Finance House, Abu Dhabi Investment House and Tanmiyat Group.<img border="0" src="gcc_dairy_8.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="104"><br>
Covering an area of over 150 million square metres, Hail eco city will 
incorporate a cluster-based development comprising transportation, logistics and 
supply chain centres; educational services; agricultural and food processing 
services; mining and commerce services; housing; and infrastructure. In the area 
of transportation, logistics and supply chain, an international airport will 
serve 3 million passengers per year, while a railway station will cater for some 
2 million passengers annually. Dry ports and operation centers will be capable 
of handling over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo annually. New highways are also 
being constructed to link the Kingdom through Hail with Jordan, Iraq and also 
Madinab.<br>
<br>
Hail’s sound base in agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of the region’s 
employment in this sector, and 90 per cent of corn, 33 per cent of potatoes, and 
31 per cent of barley produced in Saudi Arabia. Total annual production is in 
excess of 800,000 tonnes. There is enormous potential in pre-packaged foods, 
agricultural-related industries, and new technologies for more efficient use of 
water.<i>— Sowmya Sri Rallabhandi</i></font></p>

Qatar is looking to substantially raise its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within 
the next five years with liquefied natural gas (LNG) revenues being the prime 
contributor. Youssef Hussain Kamal, Qatar’s Finance Minister and Chairman of 
RasGas, one of the world’s leading LNG companies, recently said: “By the year 
2010 or 2011 we hope GDP will reach more than US $60 billion.” If Qatar manages 
to do what the minister said, it will have one of the highest per capital GDPs 
globally. LNG revenues from Qatargas and Rasgas will make up a large chunk of 
that US $60 billion.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gcc_dairy_1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="115">As 
per reports in the media in Qatar, by 2008 the UK will be receiving around a 
fifth of its gas supply from Qatar, while by 2010 the US will be meeting about a 
tenth of its gas needs from the same source. <br>
<br>
As per expectations, by 2010, Qatar’s two LNG companies, Qatargas and RasGas 
will have production capacity of 77 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). Their LNG 
will go to markets around the world. These include Japan, South Korea, India, 
Taiwan, the UK, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and, of course, the US. To give the 
perspective, 77 mtpa is three times as much as Indonesia produced in 2004, when 
it was the largest LNG producer — or around a third of projected world LNG 
production in 2010.</font></p>

<b>Open Sesame, say Gulf countries</b><br>
The GCC countries have, for quite some decades, figured among the resource-rich 
labour importing economies favouring more open trade. Working in unison to 
develop trade ties and to encourage greater foreign participation, they have 
been moving with time to better ties with the West. Cases in point are the Free 
Trade Agreements (FTA), and Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFA) 
with the United States. Bahrain has an FTA, and similar agreements are being 
negotiated with Oman (signed but not yet completed), the UAE, Kuwait and Saudi 
Arabia. TIFAs are in force in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. 
The Gulf nations have also been working to strengthen ties with emerging 
economies in Asia, particularly China and India. Most of them have also 
implemented additional tariff reforms (already at relatively low levels), with 
the introduction of the Common External Tariff (CET) among the GCC in 2003.<br>
<br>
With a strong drive to attract business, the Gulf countries are opening up and 
capturing greater foreign investment. Bahrain took the lead in first amending, 
in 2003, and then abolishing the Sole Agency Commercial Law. This streamlined 
the conditions for private enterprises operation, and eased the restrictions on 
foreign ownership. In 2003-2004, a number of key sectors such as 
telecommunications, electricity generation and petrochemicals were opened to 
competition. The UAE too has established new laws on foreign ownership, and 
plans to set up several industrial Free Trade Zones (FTZs) to attract more 
foreign firms. To attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Qatar is creating a 
‘one-stop shop’ for investors. A recent law allowing foreign ownership in 
pre-specified sectors, with the approval of the Finance Minister in each case, 
is being proposed — with upto 100 per cent ownership in select sectors like 
tourism, health and education. For Saudi Arabia, accession to the WTO has 
fast-forwarded its steps in removing the FDI barriers.<br>
<br>
Foreign entry expectations are high in the insurance, banks and other financial 
intermediaries, and energy companies operating in the downstream and midstream 
sectors. In fact, foreign banks can now set up branches while existing ones can 
increase their foreign equity from 40 per cent to 60 per cent), The Gulf 
economies have also moved aggressively over the past few years to establish 
themselves as regional and international hubs for a variety of services 
including financial services, trading, tourism and transport. Bahrain and Qatar 
have established themselves as regional financial hubs. In 2005, the Qatar 
Financial Centre created a Financial Free Zone for international banks and 
investment companies. And other services are also emerging. Kuwait is developing 
a Technology Free Trade Zone. Qatar has set up an Education City and Hamad 
Medical City, to position itself as a regional education and health services 
hub.</font></td>

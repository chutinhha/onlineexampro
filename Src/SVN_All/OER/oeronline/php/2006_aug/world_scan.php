                HP’s new generation tiny wireless chip<br>
                </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                THewlett–Packard Co. has developed a tiny wireless data chip 
                that can store up to 100 pages of text and could ultimately be 
                used in a variety of consumer and commercial applications. The 
                chip can transfer data at 10 megabits per second, 10 times 
                faster than Bluetooth wireless technology, comparable to Wi-Fi 
                rates and far faster than RFID (radio frequency identification). 
                Also, HP has managed to store up to 4 megabits in working 
                prototypes of the chip, far more than an RFID chip can store. 
                The chips is said to be embedded in paper or stuck to surfaces, 
                and may be sold eventually as self-adhesive dots. It needs no 
                battery or external electronics, getting its power via inductive 
                coupling from the read-write device. Inductive coupling is an 
                energy transfer from one circuit component to another through a 
                shared electromagnetic field. Consumers could store audio 
                commentary, music or short videos on such a chip, affixed to a 
                printed digital photograph. Devices to read and write data on 
                the chip would then eventually be embedded in cell phones, 
                handheld computers, personal computers, printers, or small 
                standalone readers.</font></p>

                Major companies that sell candy, cookies and sugary cereals have 
                turned to flashy web sites and Internet games to draw children 
                into their snack-food world, according to a study done by US 
                based Kaiser Family Foundation. Kids can ride through the lucky 
                charms ‘Wild Chocolate Mine,’ visit Kellogg’s FunKtown or kick 
                it in the Chips Ahoy! Soccer Shootout, online activities that 
                will keep them immersed in the products longer than they spend 
                watching a typical television spot, the study found. “It still 
                doesn’t have the reach TV advertising has. But who it does 
                reach, it reaches more deeply,” said lead researcher Vicky 
                Rideout. To assess how big these ‘advergames’ are, researchers 
                looked at the 77 web sites of top food companies such as 
                Kellogg’s and Wrigley’s. They found that between June and 
                November of 2005, these sites had more than 12.2 million visits 
                by children.</font></p>

                Nortel Networks Corporation and Microsoft Corporations have 
                joined hands to start a strategic alliance in order to develop 
                and market products that are supposed to merge telephones and 
                computers in the coming wave of business-communication 
                technology. The deal comes on the heels of an announcement by 
                European telecom giants Nokia Corp. and Siemens AG, that they 
                will merge their network-equipment businesses into a joint 
                venture. Microsoft and Nortel said that, under their deal, they 
                will license some of each other’s intellectual property and 
                deploy the other’s technologies in their corporate networks. The 
                arrangement is currently expected to run for four years, but 
                could be extended. Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer 
                predicted that “within 10 years, all business communications 
                will be Web-based, and will change the way people communicate.” 
                Ballmer also pledged that five major products will be ready for 
                shipping by July 2007 under the new alliance.</font></p>

                Jet engine market worth US$600 billion</b><br>
                Rolls-Royce expects a continuing, strong growth throughout Asia 
                Pacific to underpin global demand for 51,000 new commercial 
                aircraft, ranging from business jets to high-capacity airliners, 
                over the next 20 years. The company said that 114,000 jet 
                engines would be required to power the global fleets’ growth 
                with a potential value of US$600 billion. The company believes 
                that high fuel prices will drive airlines to focus even harder 
                on operating cost benefits of highly efficient, new-generation 
                jetliners.<br>
                <br>
                Rolls-Royce expects air traffic demand in the Asia Pacific to 
                grow at an average of 6.6 per cent year-on-year throughout the 
                forecast period. The growth in China over the next 20 years is 
                anticipated to be around eight per cent per annum. Demand from 
                China is expected to total 6,500 engines, valued at US$65 
                billion through to 2026.<br>
                <br>
                India continues to be recognised as a major, emerging force in 
                commercial aviation. India is included within the Asia Pacific 
                forecast total, but is expected to provide a potential market in 
                its own right for at least 1,600 engines in the next two 
                decades.<br>
                <br>
                The North American market, although growing more slowly than 
                other regions, remains the largest market for single-aisle 
                aircraft and business jets. Much of the demand is underpinned by 
                the need to replace existing aircraft, giving a market for 
                around 20,000 engines for mainline and regional aircraft, and 
                30,000 engines for business jets — worth a total of US$160 
                billion.</font></p>

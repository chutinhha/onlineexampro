Resources Development Consultants LLC, in association with Oman Economic Review 
(OER), is presenting a day full of fun, laughter, motivation, inspiration and 
enigmatic storytelling, with Jack Canfield. This seminar will take place on 10 
December at the Al Bustan Palace Intercontinental Hotel, Oman. <br>
<br>
This event is a first of a kind for Oman, as a guest of such high calibre has 
never before motivated, energized and intrigued a crowd at an event such as 
this, within the Sultanate. ORDC will hold this full day seminar delivered by 
the author of “Chicken Soup for the Soul” that sold over 80 million copies in 
over 39 languages worldwide. <br>
<br>
Canfield, renowned for warming hearts and changing lives with his “Chicken Soup 
for the Soul” bestseller, and highly successful published follow on works, will 
take seminar participants on a journey of success principles, and share with 
them his incredible wealth of experience.<br>
<br>
Canfield has conducted intensive personal and professional development seminars 
for over 750,000 people worldwide. He has spoken to hundreds of thousands of 
others at numerous conferences and conventions and has been watched by millions 
on television shows such as Oprah Winfrey, The Today Show, PBS, NBC and CBS 
Nightly News. <br>
<br>
Over his 30-year career, Canfield has developed the specific methodology and 
results-oriented activities required to help participants take on greater 
challenges and produce breakthrough results. Canfield’s Ten-Step Action Plan 
shows exactly how to plan for and create greater achievement. In fact, it’s a 
blueprint for living a life of expanded results, greater impact and more 
measurable on-the-job performance. <br>
<br>
This seminar is a full day event, in which Canfield will interact and excite 
participants using his internationally acclaimed motivational techniques. During 
the seminar the participants will learn how to; take 100 per cent responsibility 
of their lives, decide what they want and be willing to pay the price, invest 
everyday in building their knowledge base and core skills, manage time the way 
entrepreneurs do, say no to the good so that they can say yes to the great, take 
five action steps each day to achieving their goal, focus on their unique 
abilities and trust their intuition and thoughts.<br>
<br>
In this exciting new program The Success Principles will leave participants 
excited about the potential they have for their career, their company, their 
personal life and their success goals. More than just a motivational experience, 
this program offers the actual methods, strategies, activities and exercises 
participants need to achieve what they want...and what you as a company or 
professional association want for them!<br>
<br>
C E Potnis, Group General Manager for ORDC said: “The response we have had from 
initially merely proposing this event, to finally having it all set and ready to 
go is outstanding. ORDC is very confident that we are doing something very 
special within Oman, and we look forward to working closely with all of our 
sponsors to ensure this event goes down in history as THE seminar that motivated 
the Sultanate!”<br>
<br>
Oman Economic Review (OER) is the associate presenter of the event. As Oman’s 
leading business magazine, OER has been associated with high-profile events that 
are relevant to the country’s business community. “This event will further 
demonstrate OER’s commitment to continuously provide relevant opportunities to 
its readers and clients,” says Alpana Roy, Head of Publishing &amp; Marketing, OER.<br>
<br>
Events such as ‘Jack Canfield in Oman’ will go a long way in putting Oman on the 
global map, when it comes to organising high-profile corporate events. It will 
also enhance Muscat’s image as an upcoming MICE (Meetings, Incentives, 
Conferences &amp; Exhibitions) destination in the Middle East. Undoubtedly, business 
honchos in Oman will have interesting lessons to take home after interacting 
with a world-class motivational guru like Canfield.<br>
<br>
The event will take place on 10 December 2005, in the Al Bustan Palace Hotel’s 
Oman Auditorium. It will be a full day event with lunch included. <br>
<br>
Be sure not to miss out on this unique opportunity to spend a day with Jack 
Canfield. Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime!<br>

<br>
</b>The new Legacy XP launched recently has become a hit in Oman. The OTE group

<br>
<img border="0" src="passat.jpg" align="left" width="190" height="121"></b>The 
Passat, which made its market debut for the time in 1973, figures among the 
world’s most famous automobiles. The new Passat is now more than just a 
middle-class saloon. It’s sportier, more discriminate, and class-transcending. 
Its exterior design sets forth new medallion-shaped radiator grille, combined 
with headlights, bonnet and bumper that serves to succinctly sum up the 
traditional Volkswagen vitality and power. The rear is characterized by 
quick–activating LED tail lights, while the interior reveals a bright, fresh, 
stylish yet simple design, which can be adjusted, at personal request, to four 
design lines – Trend line, Comfort line, Sport line and Highline with four 
different colours – black, latte macchiato, classic grey and pure beige.<br>
<br>
The newly designed front seats highlight the new Passat’s highly ergonomic 
nature. It has a storage capacity of 585 cubic litre (+90 litre) in the back. 
The Comfort line and High line versions are equipped with retractable sun visor. 
It is 4.77meter long (+66mm), 1.82 meter wide (+74mm) and 1.47 meter high 
(+10mm). The wheel base is 2.71 meter.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Volkswagen is providing FS1 engine with 
homogenous direct injection for the first time. The output of these engines is 
110kw/150bhp and in the case of the Turbo FSL, it’s147kw/200bhp. A 3.2 litre 
V6FSL engine with 184kw/250bhp completes the top range in the fourth quarter of 
2005. It will have dual clutch transmission (DSG) and will be equipped with new 
electromechanical parking brake, starting and locking system, new adaptive 
cruise control, bluetooth telephone, sound system from Dynaudio and Volkswagen, 
new draught lights with corner illuminating and tyre inflation pressure 
monitoring system. It will provide safety in the event of a head-on collision, 
side-on collision and rear collision. It comes with dual phase front, side and 
head airbags and active headrests thus reducing the risk of whiplash.</font><br>

</b><br>
<img border="0" src="altima.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="97">The 
success of the Nissan Altima is easily reflected in its ever-growing presence on 
the roads of the Sultanate. The third-generation Nissan Altima has become one of 
the most popular cars in its category. Its superior power, greater space and 
supreme styling has made it one of the popular cars among the people. The 
3.5-Litre V6 Engine conjures a maximum power of 257 hp/6,000 rpm and has been 
voted by Ward’s Auto World as one of the “Ten Best Engines in the World” for the 
tenth year in a row. <br>
<br>

advanced options, including the well-positioned fine vision meters to the 
telescopic steering wheel with power tilt that provides the ideal driving 
position along with extra comfort and control to the driver. The recently 
launched Nissan Altima considered “the modern car for future generations” has 
received a very positive feedback from all quarters. The most common impression 
of the people who drive Altima is the powerful engine and the spaciousness and 
comfort of the interior.</font></p><hr width="70%" size="1">

</b><br>
<img border="0" src="innova.jpg" align="left" width="179" height="128" hspace="5">If 
there’s one automaker that can make everyone sit up and take notice when it 
comes to innovation, then it’s Toyota. Take the new Toyota Innova for instance. 
The Innova is just about what every owner would look for in an MPV. With amazing 
qualities that are available only from Toyota, the Innova makes for a vehicle 
that stands out in the crowd. Excellent ride quality, luxurious styling and top 
safety features place the Innova in the lead. <br>
<br>
Innova has been styled to meet international standards with a global feel. With 
a sleek yet curvy exterior the Innova boasts of a 3-dimensional front grille, 
superior multi-reflector headlamps, large tyre and alloy wheels and an 
impressive 1755 mm in height. <br>
<br>
Space is abundant in the Innova and that includes both leg as well as storage 
space. The interiors are lavishly designed with seating that spells luxury. 
Thoughtful features and eye-catching ergonomics lend the Innova a superior 
automotive feel.<br>
<br>
Toyota sets its standards high as far as safety is concerned. The Innova has a 
unique Global Outstanding Assessment (GOA) body that was developed to Toyota's 
own safety standards, which are beyond imagination. The crumple zone and high 
integrity cabin, reinforced with energy absorbing materials, help to lessen 
injury to passengers in the unfortunate case of accident. The Innova is also 
equipped with 3-point seatbelts in all the three seat rows.<br>
<br>
The Innova reinforces the fact that Toyota is a world leader where automobiles 
are concerned.</font></p>

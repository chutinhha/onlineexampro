            developed world has already ushered in. And with the digital divide 
            between the “haves” and “have nots” (that was already there in any 
            case) getting increasingly wider and wider with the advent of the

            vanguard of the world economy, the balance between knowledge and 
            resources has shifted so far towards the former that knowledge has 
            become perhaps the most important factor determining the standard of 
            living - more than land, than tools, than labour. Today's most 
            technologically advanced economies are truly knowledge-based.<br>

            above conclusion, amazing it may sound, but it does precisely 
            pinpoint the pre-eminence of knowledge, and as a corollary, 
            knowledge economy, in today’s global village. Countries may have all 
            the resources, but still trail, and stand to trail not by years or 
            decades, but ages, if they lag behind in gearing up for, what is now 
            called, the new economy. <br>
            <br>
            Take the example of the US. More than 60 per cent of the workers in 
            this country are knowledge workers (defined as “symbolic analysts”). 
            To make things more clear, knowledge workers are those who 
            manipulate symbols rather than machines. And, who are they? Fashion 
            designers. Bank workers. Policy analysts. Teachers. Pharmaceutical 
            researchers. Architects…the list goes on. They all are the new face 
            of the new economy. <br>
            <br>
            Similar is the story of the other, major, advanced economies. More 
            than 60 per cent of the workers in these countries too are knowledge 
            workers. And technology, knowledge and innovation are the key 
            factors. <br>
            <br>
            In fact, if we compare some of the most highly industrialized 
            countries of the world, based on the indices of knowledge creation 
            and knowledge sharing, Japan bags the first place, followed by the 
            US, Sweden, South Korea, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, 
            Germany and Australia. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cs1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="210" height="156">And among the developing countries, Russia, Israel and Singapore 
            lead the pack as far as ushering in the knowledge economy is 
            concerned (based on the knowledge creation index). <br>
            <br>
            Then, there are the startling success stories: countries that have 
            turned the balance of trade in their favour in no time, thanks to 
            their strong focus on knowledge economy. Until recently, India was 
            known, internationally, for its politics and culture rather than its 
            economics. However, powered by its phenomenal success in Information 
            Technology (IT), it is now considered, along with the manufacturing 
            giant, China, as the emerging economic superpower. India never was 
            short on resources, natural or human. But its tilt (read excellence) 
            in new economy resources has propelled India into the forefront of 
            Global economies.<br>
            <br>
            Bangalore, the capital of India’s southern state of Karnataka, has 
            ushered in a “silicon revolution”. Major IT companies have cut a 
            swath toward this center. <br>
            <br>
            China too wants to build its ICT (information, communication and 
            telecom) infrastructure and economy with domestic spending and 
            expertise. Argentina, Mexico, Germany, Venezula and Peru, along with 
            India, are among the countries that are trekking the similar path. 
            They are all focusing more on knowledge, than resources. And if the 
            push is not coming forth at the government level, then it’s at the 
            grassroots and corporate level.<br>
            <br>
            The buzzword, today, is knowledge economy. And the essence of this 
            new age is: shape up or ship out. Create a knowledge-based economy 
            or stand to miss the bus. Access to information, knowledge creation 
            and knowledge sharing are pivotal. Countries that fail to spend on 
            the infrastructure for new economy are likely to be left behind by 
            ages. And the time will run out sooner than expected. <br>
            <br>
            Says Dr. Dr. Salih Osman, Assistant Professor in Economics, Sultan 
            Qaboos University: “The future clearly belongs to countries that 
            have greater access to information and knowledge source. The most 
            important thing to usher in the knowledge economy is to focus on the 
            human capital. The human factor is one of the most important factors 
            in a knowledge economy.” <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Definition</b><br>
            But, what exactly is the knowledge economy? According to a 1998 
            report of the United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry, “A 
            knowledge-driven economy is one in which the generation and 
            exploitation of knowledge play the predominant part in the creation 
            of wealth.” <br>
            <br>
            There was a great turmoil in the West when machines began replacing 
            human labour, following the industrial revolution. In the industrial 
            era, it was the machines that were creating wealth. Over three 
            hundred years later, it is a different kind of change-induced 
            turmoil. The machines are being outpaced now. It’s the era that 
            people associate with high-technology industries such as 
            telecommunications and financial services.<br>
            <br>
            If one takes the most recent trends of literature in the fields of 
            management, technology, science research and economics, they all put 
            stress on the role of knowledge creation and sharing in the creation 
            of economic value at both the micro and macroeconomic levels. <br>
            <br>
            The domain of knowledge economy basically entails making effective 
            use of knowledge for development. And this requires developing 
            appropriate policies, institutions, investments, and coordination 
            across four key, functional areas (see box below).<br>
            <br>
            What, in fact, distinguishes knowledge from capital and labour is 
            that it strives to be a public good. So once it is discovered and 
            made public there is no additional cost to sharing it with more 
            users. Besides, the creator of knowledge finds it hard to prevent 
            others from using it. Devices such as trade secrets protection and 
            patents, copyright and trademarks provide the creator with some 
            protection.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Economic Freedom</b><br>
            Among the crucial factors that tend to give fillip to or curtail the 
            creation of a new economy is the presence of, or lack of, a degree 
            of economic freedom. Fred McMahon, the Director of the Center for 
            Globalization Studies at the Fraser Institute, Canada, sees a 
            definite relationship between economic freedom and knowledge 
            economy. “Economic freedom is crucial to the knowledge economy,” he 
            says. “It gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to experiment and 
            think afresh. It gives them the opportunity to innovate, to succeed, 
            and even fail, since economic opportunity will provide new 
            opportunities and failure is just a learning process to new 
            opportunities. Moreover, economic freedom protects your property 
            rights, including intellectual property – so when you do take risks 
            and succeed you will reap the rewards.” <br>
            <br>
            It may be noted that the Fraser Institute, supported by the John 
            Templeton Foundation, has launched a new initiative to promote 
            economic freedom in the world.<br>
            <br>
            McMahon is not in favour of government planning vis-à-vis the 
            promotion of knowledge economy. Says he: “Government planning 
            suppresses new thinking and experimental and reduces the economic 
            space for true entrepreneurs.” <br>
            <br>
            However, Dr. Osman sees the role of the government as the paramount 
            one. “The government holds the primary responsibility towards 
            building the infrastructure for the knowledge economy,” he 
            emphasizes. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cs7.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="118" height="141"><b>The Great Divide</b><br>
            If some experts are to be believed, the world may be sitting on a 
            powder keg of digital divide. The ability to create, sustain, and 
            push the knowledge-driven economy now defines the parameters of 
            development. So infrastructure or heavy industries may be fine, but 
            not enough.<br>
            <br>
            The ability to innovate is what separates the developed world from 
            the developing world now. And it’s here that the statistics are 
            revealing, and frightening as well. If we see the distribution of 
            knowledge-based economies across the world, it comes to hardly 20 
            per cent of the countries. The digital divide, therefore, is 
            startling to say the least.<br>
            <br>
            Agrees Mohamed bin Abdullah bin Hamed Alharthy, Chairman of the 
            Omani Economic Association: “As is the case with many developing 
            countries, we find the gap between us and the developed countries 
            widening day by day.”<br>
            <br>
            So what happens if the digital divide continues to grow? “If the 
            divide continues at the present rate, it might lead to a big 
            dichotomy. Digital divide will lead to civilizational divide,” 
            predicts Dr. Osman. It’s not without reason that some experts 
            foresee growing conflicts in a world characterized by a marked 
            digital divide: a great divide on the basis on the new economy. <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Arab World</b><br>

            Oman, Tunisia, Bahrain, and Egypt are the leaders in knowledge 
            creation (see the graphs), as per the studies carried out so far. </font></p>

            scores. This can be attributed to the fact that 50 per cent of the 
            Arab countries are oil-producing economies. Hence their ability to 
            maintain a higher overall average growth rate compared to the

            on. On all these counts, the Arab world has reasons to get worried. 
            Investing on the infrastructure for knowledge economy is one sure 
            way of getting out of the muddle. <br>
            <br>
            But the awareness about the challenges facing them is much greater 
            in the Arab world now</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> than it was earlier. Eleven Arab countries are 
            members of the World Trade Organisation; seven others are in the 
            process of joining. Then, there are the regional economic 
            associations like the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (launched in 
            January 1998 comprising 17 countries) and the Gulf Cooperation 
            Council (GCC), consisting of six countries. There were several trade 
            agreements, including partnerships with the European Union (Morocco, 
            Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan), and free trade 
            agreements with the United States (Bahrain, Jordan and Morocco, and 
            recently, Oman). The eagerness to usher in the new economy is 
            clearly there. What is perhaps required is to put an action plan in 
            place, with some sense of real urgency. <br>

            <img border="0" src="cs8.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="118" height="141">Oman: Challenges Ahead</b><br>
            Oman is taking steps in the right direction. The Sultanate’s economy 
            has tremendous potential. Of late, there have been concerted efforts 
            at the diversification of the economy, in line with the government’s 
            2020 Vision, whereby the dependence on oil has to be cut down. <br>
            <br>
            More and more industrial zones are coming up in the Sultanate. In 
            the GCC, Oman occupies a prominent place. <br>
            <br>
            According to Dr. Osman of SQU, Oman seems to be at the third 
            position in the GCC region, after Jordan and the UAE, in terms of 
            knowledge creation index (amount of research and development, state 
            of higher education, particularly in natural science, engineering 
            and communication etc.). In terms of knowledge sharing, Oman seems 
            to be occupying the fourth position, according to Dr. Salih. <br>
            <br>
            But the knowledge zones are conspicuous by the absence. “Oman has to 
            clearly work more towards building the infrastructure for knowledge 
            economy,” opines he. <br>
            <br>
            The first step, says the SQU academic, should be towards the 
            absorption of knowledge or technology in terms of provision of good 
            education, research work etc. Then comes the transfer of technology, 
            or the sharing of knowledge. The efforts have begun in this 
            direction. One very promising enterprise in this direction is 
            Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM), the technology park located 30 km from 
            Muscat, a major leap towards boosting knowledge economy in the 
            Sultanate. Ten-minute drive from the Seeb International Airport, KOM 
            neighbours Rusayl Industrial Estate - the Sultanate's largest 
            industrial park, and Sultan Qaboos University. <br>
            <br>
            From M-commerce to international call centers, KOM houses a wide 
            range of industry niches. Dedicated to supporting 
            technology-oriented businesses, KOM covers a total of 68 hectares – 
            12,000 square metres of office accommodation is already occupied, 
            with a further 10,000 square metres of office space coming on line 
            in July 2006. “More such institutions like KOM should be set up in 
            Oman to boost knowledge economy,” points out Dr. Osman. <br>
            <br>
            There have also been some concerted efforts in the Sultanate to 
            raise awareness on the need to usher in the new economy. The Omani 
            Economic Association (OEA) organized a conference on the “New 
            Economy” for the first time in the Sultanate. The conference was 
            organised in association with the United Nations Economic and Social 
            Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), Sultan Qaboos University and Oman 
            Chamber of Commerce and Industry.<br>

            A legal entity, the OEA is registered in the civil association 
            registry of the Ministry of Social Affairs. OEA aims at promoting 
            socio-economic development activities in Oman through encouraging 
            scientific research. <br>
            <br>
            The “New Economy” conference, organized in October this year, was 
            addressed by some leading scholars, who spelt out why the Arab world 
            was still lagging behind in the New Economy. <br>
            <br>
            Addressing the seminar at the Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat, 
            His Highness Sayyid Asa’ad bin Tariq Al said, His Majesty the 
            Sultan’s representative, said such conferences are of significance 
            in terms of knowing about the latest technological information used 
            in quality control and good performance, calling on the youth of 
            Oman to arm themselves with technology and knowledge.<br>
            <br>
            “The Omani economy is progressing in sound steps, especially after 
            giving more attention to the issue of finding regional and 
            international partners,” Sayyid Asa’ad said in a statement during 
            his patronage of the conference. <br>
            <br>
            The conference, in a landmark development, announced the 
            establishm<img border="0" src="cs5.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="179">ent of the Gulf Economic Association (GEA). The main 
            objectives of this new association are to promote professional 
            collaboration among different associations and individuals, who are 
            interested in the economic issues of the GCC region. The GEA also 
            aims at supporting human development and economic reforms. The 
            members of the economic associations in Oman, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, 
            Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait signed the memorandum of the GEA resolving 
            that Kuwait will host its headquarters.<br>
            <br>
            Also, in a major fillip to promoting the New Economy, the OEA and 
            the Economic and Social Committee of West Asia (ESCWA) signed an 
            agreement of cooperation with the objective of supporting the 
            efforts towards the transformation to knowledge-based economy 
            through developing small and medium enterprises, facilitating and 
            freeing trade, strengthening the relationship between the private 
            sector and universities in the field of scientific and technological 
            development, research, and enhancing the skills of the private 
            sector with respect to training and technology. <br>
            <br>
            Shaikh Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Harthy, chairman of the OEA, signed 
            the agreement on behalf of the OEA and Dr. Mervet Tilawi, Executive 
            Secretary-General of ESCWA, signed on behalf of the ESCWA. <br>
            <br>
            Commenting on the digital divide, the OEA chairman said: “As is the 
            case with many developing countries, we find the gap between us and 
            the developing countries widening day by day.” Dwelling on the new 
            challenges, he went on to add: “There is a need to face bigger 
            challenges, as Oman’s economy depends on oil and is far from 
            shifting to the competitive, productive economy.” <br>

            <b>UAE shows the way: Dubai Media City, Dubai Internet City, Dubai 
            Silicon Oasis</b><br>
            Dubai is an emirate-city where the pace of development is so rapid 
            that the landscape seems to change every few months. With Its 
            imposing skyscrapers and astonishing island projects, Dubai is 
            leapfrogging towards the new economy in a planned and determined 
            manner. The Media City, Internet City, and the Silicon Oasis, 
            carefully nurtured and promoted by the government are solid 
            investments in the infrastructure of a knowledge economy. <br>
            <br>
            Inaugurated in January 2001, Dubai Media City (DMC) is now an office 
            to over 4,000 knowledge workers, with more than 780 licensed 
            companies operating on its premises. Through its focus on speed, 
            innovation, customer service and building an employee-friendly 
            environment, DMC has already carved out a niche for itself as a 
            knowledge hub, and is all set to create a special lead in the region 
            as a global media hub for talent, ideas and creativity. <br>
            <br>
            DMC provides an environment that attracts each and every element of 
            the media value chain in the community and has developed programs 
            that could be leveraged by the media community to explore expand and 
            channel the development opportunities. A host of magazines and 
            publications, and the electronic media companies operate from DMC. 
            It is the place where every kind of media business, specifically - 
            broadcasting, publishing, advertising, public relations, research, 
            music, new media and production and post-production are encouraged 
            to thrive.<br>
            <br>
            Global giants such as CNN, Reuters, Sony Broadcast &amp; Professional, 
            McGraw Hill Publishing, Bertelsmann, and MBC, along with regional 
            companies and new start –ups are already operating from the DMC. The 
            interdependent media community also boasts a growing talent pool 
            that offers a range of creative skills. <br>
            <br>
            DMC’s free zone status is an added attraction as it implies that 
            workers can change jobs without inviting bans, thereby attracting 
            some of the best talents in the media industry. Currently, over 170 
            freelance media professionals are based in the DMC.<br>
            <br>
            With its vision of creating and marketing world class enabling 
            services for the media industry, DMC’s success in a short time is a 
            remarkable development in the Arab world. <br>
            <br>
            Like the DMC, Dubai Internet City (DIC) too is a major hub for the 
            promotion of the knowledge economy in the region. As many as 5,500 
            knowledge workers are working in DIC. A knowledge economy ecosystem 
            designed to support the business development of Information and 
            Communications Technology (ICT) companies, the DIC is the Middle 
            East’s biggest IT infrastructure, built inside a free trade zone, 
            and boasts one of the largest commercial Internet Protocol Telephony 
            system in the world. <br>
            <br>
            A strategic base for companies targeting emerging markets in a vast 
            region extending from the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent, 
            and Africa to the CIS countries, covering 2 billion people with GDP 
            $ 6.7 trillion, the DIC offers foreign companies 100 per cent 
            tax-free ownership, 100 per cent repatriation of capital and 
            profits, no currency restrictions, easy registration and licensing, 
            stringent cyber regulations, and protection of intellectual 
            property. <br>
            <br>
            No wonder then that the DIC, within a very short span of time, is 
            now home to global ICT giants such as Microsoft, Oracle, HP, IBM, 
            Compaq, Dell, Siemens, Canon, Logica, Sony Ericsson and Cisco, to 
            name just a few. <br>
            <br>
            The companies that are based in DIC have a wide range of focus, 
            ranging from software development, business services, web-based and 
            e-commerce operations to consultancy, education and training, sales 
            and marketing and back office operations. Companies looking to 
            provide cost effective business process outsourcing (BPO) services 
            such as call center operations have an ideal place to bank upon as 
            the DIC provides a scalable state-of-the-art technology platform.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cs6.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="242">DIC has also developed programs that can be leveraged by the ICT 
            community to explore and expand 'Channel Development' opportunities.
            <br>
            <br>
            In fact, the mushrooming ICT cluster at DIC also offers a high class 
            of business interaction and networking opportunities that can be 
            utilized for superior problem solving and knowledge sharing by the 
            community.<br>
            <br>
            One of the most interesting projects that will play the role of 
            promoting the knowledge economy and bridging technology divide 
            between the East and the West, will be the Dubai Silicon Oasis, the 
            technological arm of Dubai and the brainchild of General Shaikh 
            Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai. 
            Interestingly, not many people know about this landmark project that 
            aims to transfer technology into the region, especially in the 
            design and manufacturing of semi-conductors and electronic circuit 
            chips. <br>
            <br>
            Says Salah Eldin Eltayeb, Executive Manager, Media &amp; Communications 
            &amp; International Relations, Dubai Airport Free Zone &amp; Dubai Silicon 
            Oasis: “It is evident that Dubai has taken some major strides 
            towards closing the digital divide between the West and the East 
            with an objective of promoting knowledge economy.”<br>
            <br>
            Talking about Dubai’s infrastructure, in place, for the new economy, 
            he says: “Dubai has managed to attract a large number of global IT 
            companies, including Microsoft, Sun Computer, HP, to name a few, 
            which would not have been possible without establishing an enormous 
            IT infrastructure and the support of the government.” Dubai Internet 
            City and Dubai Media City, according to him, have made great 
            contribution in promoting knowledge economy and these two projects 
            have “given the Dubai government the confidence to loudly speak 
            about its initiatives towards closing the digital gap.” </font></p>

                compete in the global market. To be frank, our future success 
                will depend on the exploitation of new ideas, particularly in 
                the area of information and communication technology.<br>
                <br>
                For the Omani economy as a whole, innovation is the key to 
                higher productivity and greater prosperity for all. The 
                government has already laid the foundations of an 
                innovation-driven economy by creating a stable macroeconomic 
                environment, promoting fair and free trade and improving 
                education and skills. But there’s more to be done. To hold our 
                own in modern manufacturing and ICT - areas that PEIE is 
                actively involved in – we’ll need to innovate strongly by 
                creating new high-tech firms and light-manufacturing industries 
                as well as helping current PEIE-based firms upgrade. <br>
                <br>
                At the same time, we need to raise the level of innovation in 
                our service industries. In this regard, PEIE is in the vanguard 
                of helping Oman become a regional knowledge hub - a country with 
                a reputation for turning knowledge into new and exciting 
                products and services; a country that invests in business R&amp;D 
                and education and skills, and exports value-added goods and 
                services. As you are aware, Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM) is very 
                much part of this process. <br>
                <br>
                <b>We hear a lot about the Knowledge Economy. What's your take 
                on it?</b><br>
                In my view, the knowledge economy is shorthand for the changes 
                taking place in markets across the globe. Just think back a 
                little, only 20 years ago, phone conversations travelled by 
                copper wires, which carried less than one page of information 
                per second. Today, a strand of optical fibre as thin as a human 
                hair can transmit in a single second the equivalent of over 
                90,000 volumes of an encyclopaedia. This change is driven by two 
                factors, which reinforce each other: rapid development of 
                technology, and the opening up of markets across the globe.<br>
                <br>
                <b>When you look around, who’s being innovative?</b><br>
                Let’s look at the PC business. For instance, you have 
                traditional players producing and selling computers in a certain 
                way. Out of the blue comes Dell, selling computers direct. What 
                Dell has done is to discover a new who-what-how-positioning in 
                the business; one that allows them to break the existing rules 
                of the game. Now that’s innovative.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Are there any established firms that are innovative?</b><br>
                Most innovators are new entrants or new business start-ups. For 
                instance, EasyJet, Starbucks, Amazon.com and Applied Voice &amp; 
                Speech Technologies (AVST) spring to mind. These were 
                entrepreneurial start-ups that, having identified a new 
                positioning in the business, pursued it rigorously. <br>
                <br>
                It is unusual to find an established company innovating. And 
                there are many reasons for that, the most important being that 
                established companies already have a positioning that enables 
                them to make money; so why look for any other positioning? A new 
                entrant, on the other hand, starts with a clean canvas, allowing 
                it to identify a position that has not been taken yet. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Another obstacle that established firms face is the inertia 
                of success. Well-established, with a solid market share, reputed 
                and highly profitable... why should they change? Then there is 
                the problem of identifying a new positioning. If it was that 
                easy, everybody would be doing it, wouldn’t they? With your 
                experience of setting up KOM, where do you see innovation 
                happening in the future, particularly in IT?</b><br>
                Probably in places we least expect it. I am intrigued by what’s 
                going on in countries like China that are promoting Linux and 
                other open source solutions in its government and to its 
                citizens. Their government favours Chinese-developed open source 
                software, such as the Chinese Academy of Science’s Red Flag 
                Linux. <br>
                <br>
                Like many countries around the world, China wants to build its 
                ICT infrastructure and economy with domestic spending and 
                expertise. India, Argentina, Mexico, Germany, Venezula and Peru 
                are doing similar things, if not at the government level, then 
                at the grassroots and corporate level. With all these people 
                building software to solve real world problems using open source 
                tools and technologies, I expect there will be a deluge of new 
                innovation in that space in the next ten years or so.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What do you feel are the main challenges facing Gulf-based 
                small businesses today?</b><br>
                One of the main challenges facing the region’s small businesses 
                today centres around the death of distance. With improving 
                technology and the worldwide web, small businesses can operate 
                on a global basis. For this to succeed, they need to be as 
                professional, as efficient and as cost-effective as possible. 
                The other challenge is the immense competition from larger 
                companies.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What’s the state of entrepreneurialism in the Gulf?</b><br>
                Entrepreneurialism is thriving in the region, but there is a 
                high churn rate of entrepreneurs who come and go. For instance, 
                hundreds of budding entrepreneurs will give it a go this year in 
                terms of setting up their own enterprise but many of these will 
                close within their first three years. This is one of the many 
                start-up issues we’re grappling with in the Knowledge Mine, the 
                business incubator program at KOM.<br>
                <br>
                <b>A lot of people think entrepreneurs are born, not made…</b><br>
                This is an interesting question. I’d say both. Some people are 
                born as such - they have the right temperament and are 
                entrepreneurial from an early age and others pick it up as they 
                go along. For people like Steve Jobs of Apple and Sir Richard 
                Branson of Virgin, I’d think it’s more the former than the 
                latter. I admire people like Jobs and Branson for creating new 
                things in the face of severe doubt and opposition, and in doing 
                so, for making the lives of people that much better. Same for HP 
                in its early days! I admire Bill Joy for coming up with Java and 
                Sun for maintaining a culture of innovation and 
                entrepreneurship. <br>
                <br>
                <b>If you could change one thing overnight to make it easier to 
                start up an enterprise, what would that be? </b><br>
                Changing attitudes to enterprise and innovation is the key to 
                this. Fear of failure is one major factor that prevents many 
                people - young and old - from putting their business ideas into 
                practice and business survival rates improve dramatically when 
                fledgling businesses seek advice and support. <br>
                <br>
                So, my wish is for a cultural change to take place in the region 
                to stimulate more business start-ups, with people taking advice 
                at each stage, leading to more successful, growing businesses, 
                following on from that.<br>

                <b>Mohamad Mrayati, Regional Advisor – Science &amp; Technology, United 
                Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), 
                explains to Mehre Alam, the parameters of a sound knowledge 
                economy<br>
                <br>
                Where, in your opinion, does Oman stand with regard to 
                knowledge economy? Do you think more needs to be done to prop up the new economy 
                here?</b><br>
                If the statistics available with the Economic and Social 
                Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is any indication, all our 
                member countries need to make the extra effort to usher in the 
                new economy, or what we call, a knowledge-based economy. Oman, 
                relatively speaking, is progressing well. But at the same time, 
                the Sultanate needs to intensify its efforts to lay solid 
                foundations for the knowledge-based economy. <br>
                <br>
                The Omani economy has performed very well in the last three 
                decades. Oman has done fairly well in sectors like 
                infrastructure, education, health, and employment in the public 
                sector, but when it comes to knowledge economy, more needs to be 
                done. <br>
                <br>
                There are some very positive developments in the Sultanate, 
                like, for example, the Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM), and the 
                several industry zones. But I think that instead of establishing 
                more and more industrial zones, the Oman government should go 
                for setting up more and more knowledge zones. <br>
                <br>
                Since the 1980s, the developing countries, especially the fast 
                developing ones, have not limited themselves to establishing 
                industrial zones only. They are, in fact, establishing zones 
                that have universities and research centers besides the 
                companies. And these zones have all facilities like marketing 
                and services (banks etc.). In short, it’s a zone with life, 
                knowledge, money, education, conferences. The industrial zones 
                no longer focus on the production lines only. It’s time Oman 
                started promoting zones with focus on knowledge, technology and 
                innovation.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Do you see some benchmarks in the GCC region with regard to 
                knowledge economy?</b><br>
                If we take the indicators of imports classified according to the 
                types of technology (low, medium and high), the GCC import 
                market, I think, is biased towards low and medium technologies.
                <br>
                <br>
                If we take indicators such as exports of technology-based 
                products, the number of institutions based on innovation, the 
                expenditure on research and development, entrepreneurship 
                activities, the GCC countries are still lagging behind, compared 
                with the advanced countries.<br>
                <br>
                If we take the indicators of information and communication 
                technology like the Arabic content on the internet or on CDs, 
                the number of sites in Arabic on the internet, the number of 
                pages on the internet in Arabic, the number of computers per 
                1,000 inhabitants, or the percentage of people having access to 
                the internet etc., we see a very clear digital divide. </font>

                <font face="Verdana" size="1">If we take the communication 
                networks and the Internet, we have witnessed lately an enormous 
                development of the mobile networks, but people don’t access the 
                Internet effectively through their mobile phones. Therefore, 
                they don’t use it for production and for economic development, 
                and the fixed telephone networks are not developed as fast. <br>
                <br>
                The Internet is linked basically to fixed telephone lines and 
                not mobiles. Since the advancement in mobiles is coming about 
                much faster than the telephone lines, the Internet is not being 
                used as extensively as it should be. Consequently, information 
                or knowledge is not being circulated, produced, and used, as it 
                should be.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What are the implications of knowledge economy for the 
                corporates in a country like Oman?</b><br>
                Knowledge is basically private. It is largely in the private 
                sector domain. Technology, worldwide, is basically owned by the 
                private sector, namely the companies. Unfortunately, in Oman and 
                other countries of the ESCWA region, (the six Gulf countries are 
                part of ESCWA), the private sector companies are not known to be 
                spending much on knowledge diffusion and generation and 
                consequently, on innovation. They import production lines and 
                rarely spend on research and development (R&amp;D). <br>
                <br>
                However, they now seem to be realizing that added values or 
                profit lie in innovation. The private sector in Oman and other 
                ESCWA countries (13 in all) ought to intensify their efforts on 
                R&amp;D, and spend more money on it. <br>
                <br>
                The governments, on their part, should encourage these efforts 
                with incentives, and should foster institutes that support the 
                demand on research. <br>
                <br>
                <b>And, what are the implications for the individual?</b><br>
                As I said earlier, we are moving towards an era of 
                knowledge-based economy and towards an information society. The 
                individual is living in an information society. Therefore, he 
                should have access to information. And it’s important that he 
                has access to this information at low cost, in his own language, 
                in different fields, at his home, at his school, at his 
                company…everywhere!<br>
                <br>
                This is beginning to happen. We hope it will be happening faster 
                than it is now in this part of the world. It’s very important 
                for the individual. With the advent of the information society, 
                life is no longer what it used to be. Life has changed, so has 
                the workplace, and so have the bases of our development as 
                individuals. Knowledge and information have become extremely 
                important for everyone: for the mother, for the child, for the 
                youth, for the companies, for the whole society.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What is the next stage of knowledge economy? Where do you see 
                it in 5-10 years from now? </b><br>
                This is a very important question and a very serious one too! If 
                we leave it at the current stage, the divide in knowledge (and 
                thus the knowledge economy) between the developed and the 
                developing countries will get wider and wider. <br>
                <br>
                At the rate at which knowledge-based economies are shaping up 
                and at the current pace of globalization, we may see more 
                chauvinism of technology (technological nationalism), greater 
                technological protectionism by the developed countries, and 
                wider divide between the developed and the developing countries 
                vis-a-vis knowledge in all aspects.<br>
                <br>
                If we analyze the world of today with regard to the spread and 
                use of knowledge, we will find that more than 80 per cent of the 
                knowledge economies are concentrated in only 20 per cent of the 
                countries of the world. This is a serious knowledge divide. This 
                divide is getting wider. It’s time the developing world changed 
                its economic policies to catch up with the developed world. The 
                developed world, on its part, should change its excessive 
                protectionism of knowledge and should not ignore the developing 
                world when it comes to sharing knowledge.<br>
                <br>
                The World Trade Organization (WTO) has already set up a working 
                group (in Doha) on trade and transfer of technology. I think the 
                developed countries should take this issue seriously. It is not 
                taking it seriously. The developing countries have been pressing 
                on the need to change the previous agreements, with a view to 
                improving the transfer of technology. But the developed world is 
                still reluctant. This has dangerous portents for the future. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Do you think that the international bodies like the WTO 
                should be doing more to bridge this technological divide? </b>
                <br>
                Certainly! Within the WTO, the organization for intellectual 
                property rights (WIPO), and agencies like the UNCTAD, and the 
                World Bank, should stress for more even distribution of 
                knowledge and more sharing of knowledge with developing 
                countries. Otherwise, the divide will be dangerous for world 
                peace. It’s time to take steps to bridge this divide! <br>

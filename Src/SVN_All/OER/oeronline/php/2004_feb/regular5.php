            <img border="0" src="im14.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="150" height="147">The 
            Epson Perfection 3170 Photo scanner, launched in the Middle East, 
            has been designed to meet all of the photo and film scanning needs 
            of the consumer photo enthusiast and serious scanner user. Users 
            benefit from an extremely high resolution of 3200 dpi thanks to the 
            Matrix CCD and revolutionary micro-lens technology, coupled with USB 
            2.0 Hi-Speed connectivity. A new PC-centric ASIC processor transfers 
            image data at a higher quality and also processes the image with 
            higher frequency than previous models.<br>
            <br>
            As well as scanning photos, the Perfection 3170 Photo also provides 
            exceptional film support. New brighter lamps have been incorporated 
            for improved negative film scanning and speeds are up to three times 
            faster than was previously possible. Unusually at this price level, 
            the scanner also incorporates an integrated film adapter that 
            supports medium format film (6x9cm max.) or up to twelve 35mm film 
            frames in one scan. <br>
            <br>
            The Epson Perfection 3170 Photo has several new features including 
            Epson's new driver software, Epson Scan. This works as driver 
            software that sends image data to Twain compliant applications such 
            as Adobe Photoshop, and also as a standalone application that saves 
            images from data to file. The driver has three modes - full auto, 
            home and professional - to cater for every level of expertise. There 
            is also an Office Mode for use when using the optional ADF. <br>
            <br>
            Colour restoration of faded or discoloured prints and film also 
            forms a powerful part of the new Epson Scan software. A histogram 
            dialogue enables users to see how the image is restored while an 
            Auto Exposure engine ensures against the image becoming too 
            saturated. To avoid dust noise in the scanned image, Epson Scan 
            incorporates new Epson technology that fixes dust on the final 
            scanned image. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The exceptional processing quality for film and photos, combined 
            with speeds of up to three times faster than previous models makes 
            the Perfection 3170 Photo one of the most versatile scanning 
            solutions on the market today,&quot; said Khalil El-Dalu, GM, Epson 
            Middle East. </font>

            <p align="justify"><font size="1" face="Verdana">Oman Arab Bank (OAB) 
            and Gulf Business Machines (GBM) Oman have completed the 
            implementation of a year-long turnkey e-business infrastructure &amp; 
            Disaster Recovery solution, which has future-proofed the IT 
            environment of OAB. In addition to being able to deploy new 
            e-business and Intranet applications, introduce new delivery 
            channels, provide swifter customer services and ensure business 
            continuity, the unique and customised solution also offers the bank 
            a host of operational efficiencies and sizeable cost savings. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;OAB is the first bank in the Sultanate to implement an online 
            disaster recovery site with full integration between the networks 
            and systems,&quot; said Abdul Qader Asqalan, OAB's chief executive 
            officer. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Previously, our infrastructure could not support automatic 
            switching of the branches to the disaster recovery site because they 
            were not integrated with the MIMIX Disaster Recovery solution. Now 
            we are able to ensure the continuous availability of services and 
            minimised down time for our customers.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The solution was implemented in phases, beginning with the 
            installation of the intelligent LAN (Local Area Network) at OAB's 
            head office, followed by the WAN (Wide Area Network) which connects 
            all branches. The network was then seamlessly integrated with the 
            disaster recovery site,&quot; said Andre Podgaietsky, general manager, 
            GBM Oman.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The migration process was executed with meticulous planning by GBM 
            and OAB's IT teams and included installations at all branches in 
            record time and in a first in the Sultanate, the conducting of a 
            live disaster recovery scenario for OAB's core banking 
            applications.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            OAB and GBM also conducted two live disaster recovery executions 
            successfully - these included all OAB branches as well as head 
            office users.&nbsp; </font>

    <b>Epson 3LCD projectors EMP-760 &amp; EMP-765<img border="0" src="giz4.jpg" width="100" height="47" align="right"></b><br>
Epson has launched two new technologically advanced projectors to meet the needs 
of professional presenters on the move. The new Epson EMP-760 and EMP-765 are 
the highest featured Epson projectors in the sub 2-kg category. They give a 
best-in-class level of XGA 2500 ANSI lumens which is key for mobile presenters 
who need to deliver high quality, bright presentations in any lighting 
condition. In addition, these projectors feature Epson's exclusively developed 
E-TORL technology (Epson Twin Optimized Reflection Lamp). Combined with the 2500 
ANSI lumens, E-TORL enables presenters to give high quality and bright 
presentations despite poor or low levels of environmental light. They have low 
noise level (35dB). They come with a quick power on/instant off button function. 
Only seven seconds are needed for the projectors to become operational. There is 
no cool down time so the projectors can be immediately packed away. They can 
project a 60&quot; screen from only two metres distance and offer a long lamp life of 
up to 3000 hours (in eco mode), as well as an easy to use height adjustment.</font></p>

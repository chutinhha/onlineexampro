            significance of a country as a brand is becoming increasingly 
            important for both tourism as well as business. When I travel around 
            the world, the question people most often ask is how to best 
            position their respective country? It’s a very good question. So 
            here are the ground rules in building a country brand. Let’s start 
            with tourism. <br>
            <br>
            <b>A visual symbol</b><br>
            Your most powerful tourist destinations have visual symbols that 
            often represent the thing that people most want to see. Here’s a 
            list:</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">These are powerful symbols where you don’t even have to see the name 
            of the country to recognize where they are located. Interestingly, 
            Dubai is in the process of establishing such a visual symbol with 
            their sail-shaped Burj Al Arab hotel. <br>
            <br>
            <b>A unique concept</b><br>
            If you don’t have a visual symbol that people want to see, you need 
            a unique concept that is worth going to experience. Great Britain 
            has their castles, stately houses and royal history. New Zealand has 
            amazing physical beauty in two of the most beautiful islands in the 
            world. Spain has the sun and is Europe’s resort country.<br>
            <br>
            The Caribbean island of Grenada is an excellent example of how you 
            work out a competitive strategy. Located at the bottom of the 
            Caribbean, it is a smallish (344 sq. km) and thinly populated 
            (100,000) island with agriculture as its main source of income. With 
            a high unemployment rate (25 per cent), they wanted to increase 
            tourism. But they had enormous competition from many other islands. 
            What they did have was unspoiled countryside, unspoiled beaches, and 
            no tall buildings. This set up a unique concept of being ‘The 
            Caribbean the way it used to be’. (Unspoiled.) Their competitors 
            could do little against this unique concept.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What’s in a name? </b><br>
            There are times when your name can be a problem in attracting 
            tourism. The Russians recognized that problem with a city called 
            Leningrad. After all, who wants to go see Lenin, especially after 
            communism fell apart? Changing their name back to St. Petersburg was 
            a brilliant move that enabled them to once again use history as an 
            attraction. Once again it was the city of the czars.<br>
            <br>
            Sri Lanka also suffers from a name problem. It conjures up political 
            unrest with the Tamil Tigers and the damage of the tsunami. My 
            advice to them was like the Russians, to re-brand the country with 
            their old name Ceylon. That enables them escape their negative 
            perceptions and once again capture the romance of the tea 
            plantations and their beautiful countryside.<br>
            <br>
            The Ukraine is a name that sounds more like a region than a country 
            and few people know where it is. My advice was to use a locational 
            strategy and position the country as ‘Middle Europe’. This is 
            exactly the direction they are pursuing by moving away from their 
            Russian connections in the last election.<br>
            <br>
            But that’s all to do with tourism, how about business?<br>
            <br>
            <b>Product heritage</b><br>
            From a business point of view, a country’s brand reputation comes 
            out of its successful global products. They develop what we call a 
            ‘Heritage’ position in certain categories. Here’s another list of 
            countries and for what they are known to illustrate this point:</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Obviously, it’s the global brands that tends to build a country’s 
            reputation or their dominance in a certain commodity or field of 
            activity.<br>
            <br>
            If you’re introducing a product that reflects the country’s 
            heritage, you have some built-in momentum. If not, you can have a 
            problem. For a high-tech Argentinean company, we recommended that 
            they make their U.S. office the headquarters and become an American 
            company instead of an Argentinean company. This turned out to be a 
            very successful strategy as they were able to take advantage of the 
            U.S. high technology heritage. <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes countries don’t take advantage of their heritage. China 
            could certainly build a big porcelain brand with their long history 
            in this category. I suggested to them that they bring back the most 
            famous porcelain brand in history. (Ming.) It would be a runaway 
            success.<br>
            <br>
            Spain has overlooked a heritage opportunity. They are the dominant 
            leader in olive oil production, but Italy is perceived as the king. 
            They actually sell more olive oil to Italy than Italy produces. 
            Spain should lay claim to being “The World’s No.1 Producer” of olive 
            oil and they should dramatize this with the following concept: “Two 
            thousand years ago the Romans were our best customers. Today they 
            still are.”<br>
            <br>
            Obviously, labeling and other marketing activities are called for, 
            but the opportunity is there for the taking. Interestingly, Spain is 
            just now undertaking such a programme. <br>
            <br>
            <b>The role of a national airline</b><br>
            Does a national airline contribute to the branding of a country? I 
            don’t think so. Airline brands have to stand on their own strategy, 
            which doesn’t often reflect on a country’s strategy. British Airways 
            isn’t about history, it’s about experience, an extensive route 
            structure and being ‘The world’s favorite airline to fly’. Singapore 
            Airlines is about a higher class of service, not about the country.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, was involved in the three-star city 
            programme but it didn’t help the airline and they are no longer with 
            us. They didn’t have enough of a route structure to compete. Nor did 
            Air New Zealand. The bottom line: Countries are one set of branding 
            problems. Airlines are another. In this era of killer airline 
            competition, most flag carriers lose money that could be better 
            spent by a country in making it more attractive for other airlines 
            to fly there.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Why go to Oman?</b><br>
            For Oman to pursue a branding strategy, it has to first determine 
            whether it’s to pursue business, tourists or both? In either case, 
            you need a differentiating idea. Each decision will require a 
            different strategy. <br>
            <br>
            If the answer is tourists, you need to start with your competitor 
            which, in your part of the world, is Dubai. Such was the case many 
            years ago when I was working on developing a tourist strategy for 
            Belgium. Their big next-door competitor was Amsterdam and their 
            canals. What evolved was taking advantage of the fact that the 
            Michelin Guide rated cities as well as restaurants and Belgium had 
            five three-star cities. Holland had only one. Thus, people visiting 
            Holland’s three-star city, Amsterdam, were encouraged to also visit 
            the three-star cities in the country next door. <br>
            <br>
            With the right strategy and execution, Dubai and Oman could become 
            two places to see in the Middle East. Dubai has already done a lot 
            of work in this regard. Oman has a lot left to do. </font></p>

                Instrumental in developing the vital approach to marketing known 
                as ‘positioning’, Jack Trout is responsible for some of the 
                freshest ideas to be introduced into marketing thinking in the 
                last several decades. He is the President of Trout &amp; Partners, 
                one of the most prestigious marketing firms with headquarters in 
                Old Greenwich, Connecticut, USA and offices in 13 countries. <br>
                <br>
                He manages and supervises a global network of experts that apply 
                his concepts and develop his methodology around the world. The 
                firm has done work for AT&amp;T, IBM, Burger King, Merrill Lynch, 
                Xerox, Merck, Lotus, Ericsson, Tetra Pak, Repsol,

                Fortune 500 companies. <br>
                <br>
                Trout started his business career in the advertising department 
                of General Electric. From there he went on to become a 
                divisional advertising manager at Uniroyal. Then he joined Al 
                Ries in the advertising agency and marketing strategy firm where 
                they worked together for over twenty-six years. <br>
                <br>
                With Al Ries, he co-authored the industry classics including 
                ‘Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind’, ‘Marketing Warfare’, 
                ‘Bottom-Up-Marketing’ and ‘The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing’. 
                Jack Trout closed the circle with the sequel to Positioning ‘The 
                New Positioning’ followed by ‘The Power of Simplicity - A 
                Management Guide To Cutting Through the Nonsense And Doing 
                Things Right’, ‘Differentiate or Die - Survival in Our Era of 
                Killer Competition’, ‘Big Brands Big Trouble’ and ‘The Genie's

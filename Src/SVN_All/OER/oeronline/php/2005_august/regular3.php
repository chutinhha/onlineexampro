to make fastest supercomputer </b><br>
Japan could turnout to be behind the making of the world's fastest 
supercomputer. It is planning to begin research next year on a new machine that 
would operate 73 times faster than IBM's current record holder, as per a Japan 
Government spokesperson.<br>
<br>
Currently, the American Blue Gene/L system supercomputer which is developed by 
International Business Machine (IBM) Corp. at Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory in Livermore, California, is the world's fastest supercomputer. The 
machine is capable of 136.8 teraflops, or 136.8 trillion calculations per 
second.<br>
<br>
Japan is exploring the possibility of developing a supercomputer that can 
operate at 10 petaflops, or 10 quadrillion calculations per second, which is 73 
times faster than the Blue Gene, as per sources. <br>
<br>
The total cost of the project is expected to range between $714-893 million. An 
official firm decision on the project will be taken sometime in August thus 
year. If approved, the next-generation supercomputer will be ready by sometime 
in 2010-11. It must be remembered that Japan's Earth Simulator supercomputer, 
introduced in 2002, had been the world's fastest until 2004, when the IBM's Blue 
Gene took the title. <br>
<br>
Currently, the Earth Simulator, at a speed of 35.9 teraflops, is ranked fourth 
after the IBM's two Blue Gene systems and NASA's Columbia system, all in the 
United States, according to the top 500 list of the world's fastest 
supercomputers, released at the International Supercomputing Conference held in 
June in Heidelberg, Germany.</font></p><hr size="1">

    <b>HP dismantles 4 R&amp;D groups</b><br>
Following its restructuring targeted at eliminating its global workforce by 10 
per cent, Hewlett-Packard has dismantled its four research groups at HP Labs. HP 
has dropped a team based in Palo Alto focused on advanced software research led 
by Alan Kay, a respected computing pioneer. The technology major has also 
dissolved two Palo Alto labs that dealt with emerging technologies and consumer 
applications and a group in Cambridge, Mass., that handled research on health 
care and medical issues. <br>
<br>
In a related move, the company has also consolidated the HP Labs organization by 
eliminating a level of management that ran three separate research centers for 
printing and imaging research, Internet and computing platforms, and information 
technology services. Kay is widely respected as one of the pioneers of personal 
computing who also helped design the ARPAnet, the forerunner of the Internet. He 
has won two of the computing industry's highest honors, the Association for 
Computing Machinery Turing Award and the National Academy of Engineering Charles 
Stark Draper Prize. <br>
<br>
Despite the cutback in R&amp;D activities, HP has stressed that it remains committed 
to innovation through research and development, citing HP Labs' continuing work 
in the fields of nanotechnology and quantum computing. As per a company 
spokesperson, “The message is (that) we are trying to refocus our research into 
the areas of greatest promise and our core strength and those areas which are 
most important to HP in the medium and long term. <br>
<br>
Despite these cuts, we still have a rich and varied research agenda. We're still 
doing a lot of interesting and very important work. There just comes a time when 
you have to set priorities.&quot;</font></p><hr size="1">

to become No.1 entertainment gadget</b><br>
LG Electronics has predicted that mobile phones will overtake all other 
entertainment consumer electronics in the next three years as the pace of 
development in handset features becomes ever more rapid. According to 
Seoul-based Dr. Kang Tea Ik, Chief Research Engineer for LG Mobile 
Communications: “The next generation 3.5G LG mobile phones will open up a whole 
new world of possibilities, and will come equipped with multimedia broadcasting 
functions allowing users to watch terrestrial broadcasts and talk on the phone 
at the same time.”<br>
<br>
Dr. Kang predicted that data transfer speed will soon reach 10 Mbps and new 
handsets will provide converged technologies capable of broadcast functions 
(DMB), video-on-demand, video conferencing, and interactive broadcasting. The 
expansion of mobile phone capability will also spur major content improvements, 
with developers soon introducing 3D story games and multiple-player games for 
both on and off-line mobile users.<br>
<br>
“When it comes to broadcasting, various DMB mobile phones are already available 
in mature markets like the US, Japan and Korea,” Dr. Kang said. “This technology 
will receive a further boost when LG Electronics’ 3.5G (HSDPA) handset arrives 
in the United States, Europe and Japan in the first quarter of 2006.”<br>
<br>
With worldwide handset sales forecast to reach one billion a year by 2009, 
according to analysts Gartner, advanced technology phones are expected to occupy 
an increasingly lucrative part of the global mobile market.<br>
<br>
LG has to its credit - manufacturing the world’s first PTV (Push-To-View) 
technology allowing multiple users to share live video in real time; the first 
DMB handset; the first synchronous/asynchronous combined 3G handset; and the 
slimmest CDMA mobile phone.</font></p><hr size="1">

Windows Vista to debut in 2006 </b><br>
Microsoft Corp has announced that it will call the next version of its operating 
system as ‘Windows Vista’. It was formerly known by its code-name Longhorn. It 
is expected to enter market in the second half of 2006, five years after the 
entry of Windows XP. It is the longest time lag between releases of its flagship 
operating system that runs on 9 out of 10 personal computers worldwide. However, 
Windows Vista Beta Beta 1, targeted at developers and IT professionals, will be 
made available by August 3, 2005.<br>
<br>
Windows Vista is expected to be better than Windows XP on features including 
security, graphics and computing over the Web. Microsoft is going to release 
more details on Vista at a developer’s conference in September this year. <br>
<br>
Microsoft is banking on new products including Windows Vista, the next version 
of Office, new database software and the Xbox 360 video game console to return 
to double-digit growth. Microsoft’s annual revenue recorded growth of just 8 per 
cent by touching $30.79 billion in 2004, the slowest yearly growth since 
Microsoft went public in 1986.</font></p>

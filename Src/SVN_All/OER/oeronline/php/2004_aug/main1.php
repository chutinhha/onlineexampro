            <b>GCC countries sure believe in taking fun seriously. Started a few 
            years ago, the region's increasing party spirit and summer festivals 
            have had a positive effect on the economy. Various reports estimate 
            the region's summer fiestas to have had a combined economic impact 
            in the range between RO3 billion and 5 billion. Shuchita Kapur

            <img border="0" src="im30.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="150" height="300">Come 
            summer, and it's time again for summer festivals in the six GCC 
            nations. Whether it's the Khareef Salalah Festival in Oman, Dubai 
            Summer Surprises (DSS) in the UAE or the Jeddah Ghair in Saudi 
            Arabia, the word is official: Arabs have a healthy appetite for 
            entertainment and the region's popular summer festivals have had a 
            gluttonous impact on the regional economy. These mega entertainment 
            and shopping events have converted the once lean summer months into 
            a time bubbling with activity and fun. <br>
            <br>
            This newfound synergy between tourism, entertainment and shopping is 
            certainly paying off dividends. Tourist inflow graph is curving 
            upwards, vacant hotels are recording a high occupancy rate, shopping 
            malls are full of buyers and many unemployed people land up jobs. 
            With each passing year, these summer festivals are gaining more and 
            more popularity in all the six countries in the GCC. Having realised 
            the importance of the tourism sector for the healthy state of the 
            economy, governments in these countries are focusing on marketing 
            such events to attract monetary inflow into the countries and, 
            today, all the countries are members of the World Tourism 
            Organisation (WTO). <br>
            <br>
            After decades of relying on oil and gas, the Gulf countries of Oman, 
            Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia 
            are preparing for the post-oil era. The economic model they have 
            charted is patterned along the lines of Singapore, which, having few 
            natural resources, created an economy based on services and tourism. 
            The UAE, probably the least oil-rich of the Gulf countries, took the 
            lead in the late 1980s and is aiming to become the regional hub for 
            tourism. Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are following 
            suit to seek a piece in this economic pie. <br>
            <br>
            Tourism to the Middle East is growing faster than any other region 
            of the world, with an increase of 17 per cent in arrivals in 2002 
            and 10 per cent in 2003, a year that saw negative tourism growth 
            worldwide. According to WTO figures, by the year 2020, visitor 
            traffic to the Middle East region will increase to 69 million. The 
            following graph showcases world trend in tourism. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="im24.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="200" height="135">This 
            is the time to get active and promote tourism in the region. 
            Although all countries in the region focus on promoting tourism 
            throughout the year, they have particularly taken up the task of 
            doing it during the summer months. Dubai is doing it by giving an 
            air-conditioned environment to visitors even when the temperature is 
            soaring to 50-degrees Celsius whereas Oman is exploiting its natural 
            beauty and the cool climes of its Dhofar region to attract tourists. 
            Providing state-of-the-art tourist infrastructure with numerous 
            world-class hotels, shopping spectaculars with great cultural events 
            and sports have taken the form of summer festivals in these 
            countries. <br>
            <br>
            However, while individual countries are doing tremendous work with 
            regard to giving a major tourism push to their economies, what the 
            region lacks is perhaps a Schengen Visa (see box) kind of impetus to 
            take tourist inflow into the region to even greater heights. In 
            fact, many of the GCC countries have relaxed their visa regulations 
            in an attempt to increase tourist arrivals. Moreover, GCC nations 
            have their annual fests more or less during the same summer months - 
            it would make perfect business sense for these nations to combine 
            forces and offer tourists--both from within the region as well as 
            from outside--a chance to stay and move around freely in GCC 
            countries. <br>
            <br>
            With the GCC customs union now a reality, a combined Gulf visa may 
            not be just a pie-in-the-sky. If the governments of the GCC 
            countries do, sometime in the future, decide to allow a combined 
            visa for tourists, even merely during the summer months, the total 
            positive economic impact on the region will definitely be far 
            greater than the sum of the parts. Furthermore, it will provide the 
            region's hospitality and the airline industries the much needed 
            impetus in terms of additional room occupancy and traffic inflow.<br>
            <br>
            Let us have a closer look at the summer festivals in these countries 
            and the impact they have on the region's economy.

                    <b>Khareef Salalah Festival</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Although Oman's economy is geared by the petroleum sector, 
                    the country has realised that it must move away from a 
                    hydrocarbon dependency and is expanding its non-oil 
                    portfolios for income generation. The increasing number of 
                    tourists coming to the Sultanate is a good omen for the 
                    country, as it is targeting tourism to be one of the major 
                    revenue earners in the coming years. The country aims at a 3 
                    per cent contribution to GDP (RO600,000 or about $1.5 
                    billion according to 1999 figures) from tourism by 2020.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="im25.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="200" height="139">In 
                    this regard, the government is making all efforts to open 
                    Oman to the world, and special festivals like the Khareef 
                    Salalah and the Muscat Festival have become special annual 
                    events to help boost the tourism sector. <br>
                    <br>
                    Its beautiful scenery and cool climate make Salalah a place 
                    blessed with heavenly bliss, when scorching heat and high 
                    humidity engulfs the entire region. The best season in 
                    Salahah is from late June until the end of August. This is 
                    time when this area experiences cooling rains from the 
                    southwest monsoon winds. The Salalah Festival is well timed 
                    with the good season to increase the tourist flow into the 
                    country. The festival is usually held over a six-week period 
                    from mid-July until the end of August. The event promotes 
                    the Dhofar region and hosts a variety of cultural, sports, 
                    and entertainment activities. Offering an ideal place for 
                    families to enjoy their summer holidays, the Salalah Khareef 
                    Festival 2004 opened on July 15 and will last till August 
                    31. <br>
                    <br>
                    Started in 1995, the Khareef Salalah Festival has become 
                    popular among tourists from across the world, especially 
                    from within the GCC. The festival also attracts many 
                    tourists from within Oman. Over the years, it has grown into 
                    an international festival thanks to the long-standing 
                    efforts of the authorities to expand the existing tourism 
                    infrastructure in Salalah. <br>
                    <br>
                    This year, it is expected that a record number of visitors 
                    will visit Salalah during the festival season. A lot of 
                    effort has been put into marketing and promoting the event. 
                    The Dhofar Municipality's Festival Department is responsible 
                    for marketing, promoting and organising the Khareef 
                    Festival. Last year (2003), the Municipality actively 
                    participated at Discover Oman - Oman's first adventure and 
                    tourism exhibition held between September 25 and October 3, 
                    2003, at Oman International Exhibition Centre. <br>
                    <br>
                    By participating prominently at Discover Oman, the 
                    Department attracted huge numbers of potential domestic 
                    tourists, both Omanis and expatriates from Muscat and 
                    neighbouring Wilayats. During this event, a lot of 
                    information about Khareef Festival activities was given to 
                    visitors and they were told about various tourism and 
                    adventure destinations and facilities which the Khareef 
                    Salalah Festival has to offer. <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides the road shows to promote the Khareef Festival in 
                    Salalah which began as early as April 1999, the government 
                    has also carried out many international campaigns to market 
                    the event. &quot;We have worked very hard in the last five years 
                    to promote tourism during the Khareef season. Our campaign 
                    was not limited to the Gulf, but to other Arab countries, 
                    Europe and Japan. Our embassies and missions abroad have 
                    also put in a lot of efforts to market the country as a 
                    serious tourist destination,'' a Tourism Department official 
                    said. <br>
                    <br>
                    This year, on the promotion plan, Dhofar Municipality has 
                    included advertising on Oman TV and Arab satellite channels 
                    (a total of 1,200 advertisements), local and Arab press (170 
                    advertisements) and publishing of thousands of brochures. 
                    The Website of Dhofar Municipality also helps in promoting 
                    the festival as it keeps the surfers updated with the 
                    events. <br>
                    <br>
                    Most tour companies have witnessed a steady increase of the 
                    tourist flow to Salalah in the last five years. They believe 
                    that the Dhofar region will become a major income earner for 
                    the tourism industry. This year, they expect a larger 
                    tourist turnout thanks to a comprehensive marketing campaign 
                    carried out by the government. Many tourism information 
                    centres have also been set up to provide tourists with 
                    various services. These centres are located at Hareet border 
                    checkpoint, Salalah airport and at the Municipality 
                    Entertainment Centre at Ateen Plain. The tourism information 
                    centres provide visitors with guiding pamphlets, brochures 
                    and maps. <br>
                    <br>
                    To facilitate inflow of visitors, special arrangements are 
                    in place including visa relaxation, special promotional 
                    fares by Oman Air, and discounted packages by all hotels. 
                    Many new events and activities will feature in this year's 
                    festival. The opening ceremony was in the form of a 
                    carnival. The authorities thought it fit to launch a 
                    carnival and shopping festival this year to further enhance 
                    the Khareef attraction. <br>
                    <br>
                    A lot of religious and cultural programmes, theatrical shows 
                    and special programmes for families and kids have been 
                    organised. Participants from Oman, Gulf and Arab countries, 
                    including Saudi singer Mohammed Abdu, will perform during 
                    the festival. Besides the Khareef Salalah Festival, Muscat 
                    Festival, which is held during January, has succeeded in 
                    drawing visitors from the neighbouring countries. The 
                    festival offers a wide range of activities. Culture, 
                    education, sports, tourism and the arts are highlighted 
                    during the festival. <br>
                    <br>
                    Promoted under the motto 'Yes to Oman', Muscat Festival aims 
                    to bring Oman under limelight and has gained popularity with 
                    each passing year. The festival is organised by Muscat 
                    Municipality with the support of the private sector. The 
                    festival focuses on the traditional and modern aspects of 
                    Oman. <br>
                    <br>
                    A record number of visitors attended Muscat Festival 2004. 
                    The event boosted the tourism, business and economic sectors 
                    of Oman, earning rich dividends for each of these sectors. 
                    The number of visitors reached 1.5 million in 2003, and 
                    hotels achieved 100 per cent occupancy and the overall 
                    economy benefited.</font></p>

                    <br>
                    The annual Jeddah 25 Festival opened on June 17, 2004. Known 
                    for its many entertaining, social, sports, educational, 
                    recreational, culture, arts, technology and scientific 
                    activities, the Jeddah Ghair has the best of what Jeddah has 
                    to offer. The event is a six-week-long extravaganza, lasting 
                    till July 30, 2004. <br>

                    <img border="0" src="im26.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="250" height="141">The 
                    Jeddah festival, one of the biggest events held in the 
                    Kingdom every year, has successfully boosted the tourism 
                    industry in the country. According to official figures, 
                    tourists who visited Jeddah during last year's summer 
                    festival spent more than SR880 million (RO90.23 million). 
                    The first Jeddah summer festival started in 1999, and even 
                    during that time, it attracted about 1.2 million visitors. 
                    Thereafter, the festival has successfully been able to rope 
                    in more tourists, which has increased capital flow into the 
                    country. In the year 2000, the Jeddah festival generated 
                    business worth SR1.769 billion (RO181.38 million). Of this, 
                    retail traders grabbed the lion's share of SR721 million 
                    (RO74 million), followed by recreation centres. <br>
                    <br>
                    According to a study conducted by a specialised office in 
                    cooperation with the research centre at the Jeddah Chamber 
                    of Commerce and Industry, foreign tourists spent the largest 
                    amount of money on the many and varied attractions and 
                    services during the festival. These observations were 
                    further reinstated by KPMG. An economic impact study 
                    conducted by the group established that number of visitors 
                    had grown from 980,000 in 1999 to more than 2,000,000 in 
                    2001, and this figure is expected to increase every year. 
                    Jeddah Summer Festival is considered the biggest family 
                    entertainment event in Saudi Arabia. <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides local visitors, the event organisers expect a lot of 
                    tourists from within the GCC. Keeping in mind the growing 
                    potential of this sector, the Saudi government is trying to 
                    add more attractions to this event. Besides the laser shows, 
                    fireworks, parachute jumps, ice skaters, circus, musical and 
                    other cultural events, this year's campaign is unique as it 
                    includes several innovative programmes such as a media 
                    centre that will serve local and international press, as 
                    well as daily broadcasts on MBC FM radio and weekly coverage 
                    on MBC and other satellite television channels. <br>
                    <br>
                    The festival is expected to account for a tremendous boost 
                    to Jeddah's image as a tourist destination in addition to 
                    its status as the gateway to the two holy cities. Another 
                    outstanding feature of this year's festival will be the 
                    establishment of a Surprise Village over an area of 65,000 
                    sq mt, which will comprise 100 different events to attract 
                    visitors. The aim is to establish Jeddah as the leisure 
                    capital of Saudi Arabia.

                    <br>
                    Dubai Summer Surprises (DSS) is an annual event held by the 
                    Government of Dubai in order to boost tourism and shopping 
                    in Dubai, with the long-term objective of turning Dubai into 
                    a year-round tourism destination. Proclaimed as the summer 
                    capital of fun, DSS aims to energise trade and tourism 
                    during the relatively lean summer months. Undoubtedly, DSS 
                    brings with it a lot of colour and excitement, but the event 
                    has also metamorphosed the summer season in the country. It 
                    has boosted the country's trade by drawing vacationing 
                    families to hotels, shopping malls and entertainment centres, 
                    particularly from elsewhere in the Gulf.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="im27.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="250" height="122">Business 
                    has been doing particularly well in its first three weeks of 
                    the ongoing DSS 2004. According to official figures, DSS 
                    2004 has surpassed records set last year in business, retail 
                    and tourism sectors. Till date, sales in shopping malls are 
                    up 10 per cent in these first three weeks as compared to 
                    last year, and hotel traffic is up to 82 per cent, according 
                    to the statistics. The high visitor traffic generated by DSS 
                    2004 in its opening weeks has greatly contributed to Dubai's 
                    summer economy. Nearly all sectors associated with the 
                    events--tourism, travel, retail, trade and exchange, 
                    restaurants, hotel and hospitality--are reaping benefits.<br>
                    <br>
                    Even though it's just the beginning of the festival, hotels/ 
                    hotel apartments around the city have reported an occupancy 
                    rate between 75 and 98 per cent. The participating hotels 
                    expect the occupancy rates to surge during the coming weeks 
                    of DSS 2004. Flowing with the number of bookings, most 
                    hoteliers expect their occupancy rate to soon be 100 per 
                    cent. In the first two weeks of the festival, Metropolitan 
                    Hotels International has recorded 98 per cent occupancy 
                    across all its properties - Metropolitan Palace Hotel, 
                    Metropolitan Sheikh Zayed Rd, Metropolitan Beach Hotel, 
                    Jumeirah and Metropolitan Deira. <br>
                    <br>
                    Same goes for InterContinental Dubai. The hotel achieved 87 
                    per cent occupancy in the month of June, and the figure is 
                    expected to reach 89 per cent in July and August. Most 
                    bookings are made by tourists from the AGCC countries, but 
                    there are a number of bookings form the UK and other 
                    European countries as well, the officials at the hotel 
                    reported. <br>
                    <br>
                    Other important hotel like Accor Hotels World Trade Centre, 
                    Dubai, is doing good business too. It has recorded 80 per 
                    cent occupancy at Novotel and Ibis has recorded 70 per cent 
                    occupancy. Coral Deira Hotel has recorded 75-80 per cent 
                    occupancy. <br>
                    <br>
                    According to the organisers, a lot of hard work and planning 
                    goes into making DSS a successful event. Besides the 
                    enormous investment made, the marketing strategy behind the 
                    growing popularity of DSS is commendable. This large-scale 
                    event, right from its opening ceremony till the closing, is 
                    organised and handled together by the government departments 
                    and the DSS office. Besides using all forms of the media, 
                    special road shows for DSS are organised in various 
                    countries like Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia etc. in 
                    order to reach out to the audience. <br>
                    <br>
                    Right from Hong Kong to the United States, tourists flock to 
                    be a part of the DSS. Assessing the phenomenal success of 
                    DSS, officials are of the view that Dubai can be turned into 
                    an extremely hot tourist destination during any season. 
                    &quot;Summer events such as DSS have proved that UAE can be 
                    marketed as a year-round tourist destination,'' said Saeed 
                    Mohammed Al Nabouda, the chief executive officer of DSS. 
                    According to him, there has been an increase in awareness in 
                    what Dubai has to offer the international visitors, and that 
                    the city is now ranked eighth in the world for tourists to 
                    visit. &quot;The phenomenal growth in Dubai's tourism industry is 
                    a reflection of the government's commitment to actively 
                    diversify economy and to reduce dependence on oil revenue, 
                    which is a finite resource,'' he added.

                    <b>Dubai Shopping Festival</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Dubai Shopping Festival is an inseparable part of the DSS. 
                    Participating in DSS activities and shopping just seem to go 
                    hand in hand for tourists who come to be a part of the DSS. 
                    The success of the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF) has helped 
                    enhance the country's profile on the global tourism map, not 
                    only as a leading shopping destination, but also has a 
                    tourism hub. Today, DSF attracts hordes of visitors from all 
                    over the globe. <br>
                    <br>
                    DSF is a time when the word sale is taken 
                    for granted in Dubai. Shopping malls, under the umbrella of 
                    the Dubai Shopping Malls Group (DSMG), not only give great 
                    discounts and bargains but also become hubs of 
                    entertainment, providing shows and hosting key events of 
                    different surprises. To make the DSF a hassle-free time, the 
                    Dubai Department of Economic Development (DED), the main 
                    regulatory body which organises and regulates trade and 
                    industry in the emirate, keeps a strict vigil on the shops 
                    that give discounts. Shops that do not adhere by the rules 
                    as set down by the DED can face action by the authorities 
                    and an investigation can be launched against them if 
                    customers lodge a complaint with the Department. <br>
                    <br>
                    DSF 2004, which was held from January 15 to February 15, 
                    2004, was a huge success. During this time, the festival 
                    registered a total of 3.1 million visitors, posting a growth 
                    of 6 per cent over 2.92 million visitors in 2003. The total 
                    visitor spend during DSF 2004 touched Dh5.8 billion 
                    (RO607.24 million), compared to Dh5.12 (RO536.05 million) 
                    billion in the previous year, thus registering an increase 
                    of 13.28 per cent. The retail spending for the same period 
                    posted a 169 per cent increase over the figures achieved in 
                    1996. The shopping malls contributed 58 per cent of the 
                    total sales achieved during DSF 2004. Restaurants 
                    contributed 22 per cent of the total visitor spend while 
                    hotels and hotel apartments accounted for 14 per cent. 
                    (Figures were made public by DSS CEO Saeed Mohammed Al 
                    Nabouda.)

                    <br>
                    Just like its neighbours, the state of Qatar--which has one 
                    of the world's largest reserves of natural gas--is embarking 
                    upon a steep travel and tourism growth trajectory. At the 
                    World Travel &amp; Tourism Council summit in May 2004, Akbar Al 
                    Baker, head of the national tourism development company and 
                    Qatar Airways, unveiled a US$15 billion (RO5.77 billion) 
                    tourism master plan designed to make Qatar a &quot;world-leading 
                    high-quality tourist destination''. He said the plan is 
                    aimed at the &quot;high-end tourist market'', and will offer 
                    beach resorts, sun, desert landscapes, an Arabic cultural 
                    heritage, luxury hotels, conference facilities and major 
                    international sporting events - &quot;all in a very safe 
                    environment''. <br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="im23.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="200" height="146">He 
                    added the plan represents one of the largest investments in 
                    tourism in the Gulf region and will help more than double 
                    tourism growth from roughly 400,000 annual visitors to in 
                    excess of 1 million by 2010. Thus, a massive PR and 
                    marketing drive has been launched and millions of riyals are 
                    being pumped into the tourism sector. However, according to 
                    officials, no payback is expected immediately, or in the 
                    near future. The only immediate return expected is exposure, 
                    regionally as well as globally. <br>
                    <br>
                    The annual Summer Wonders festival (QSW), which started in 
                    2002, is part of this larger plan - an important component 
                    of Qatar's Tourism Master plan, &quot;to establish Qatar as a 
                    high quality destination for cultural tourism, beach 
                    resorts, shopping, business, education and sports,'' says 
                    Tourism Authority CEO Fred van Eijk. The intention behind 
                    QSW is not just inviting visitors, but to urge residents to 
                    stay behind during summer. Even though Qatar started later 
                    than countries like Oman and the UAE, the QSW 2002 was a 
                    huge success and a lot of people stayed back in the country, 
                    avoiding large expenses related to overseas travel. Besides 
                    the local people, the festival was also able to attract 
                    foreign visitors, thus activating tourism in the country.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This year, Qatar is all set for high visitor traffic during 
                    Summer Wonders 2004, which is in full swing. <br>
                    <br>
                    Having played host to roughly 2.5 million tourists in 2003, 
                    organisers of the festival expect a two-fold increase in 
                    visitors to Qatar Summer Wonders 2004. This year's festival 
                    once again targets the huge GCC tourism industry, with 
                    hotels, shopping malls and the country's national airline 
                    announcing special incentives and offers to lure both 
                    residents and visitors. <br>
                    <br>
                    According to officials at the Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA), 
                    many visitors from Levant countries and the Indian 
                    subcontinent visit the country during the event but the bulk 
                    of tourists are from the GCC. &quot;Awareness about tourism 
                    potential in Qatar is steadily rising and the country's 
                    vibrant economy has ensured a high flow of business visitors 
                    throughout the year,'' says Fred van Eijk, CEO, QTA. &quot;The 
                    QSW takes that reputation a step further by highlighting the 
                    immense facilities and infrastructure we have in place. We 
                    are pleased that leading corporate names in the country's 
                    economic development have thrown their weight behind this 
                    campaign'', he added. <br>
                    <br>
                    Economically, QSW doesn't contribute much to the sate 
                    economy. Being in its initial years, &quot;this festival is not 
                    an opportunity for QTA to make profit - we have been given 
                    government subsidies to provide the people of Qatar with 
                    entertainment. Many of the activities are free and those 
                    that are not are (offered) at a nominal fee. However, huge 
                    economic benefits have been gained by the participating 
                    outlets. For every QR50 (RO5.29) purchase at these outlets, 
                    a coupon is given which gives the buyer a chance to be a 
                    lucky winner in the weekly raffle draws with gifts totalling 
                    QR500,000 (RO52,884) in value. In the first week alone, 
                    ticket sales came to QR2.8 million (RO296,148), which shows 
                    that people have seized the opportunity to go out and shop. 
                    I personally and in the newspapers have received comments 
                    from many shop owners stating that their sales during the 
                    festival are significantly higher than in normal days'', 
                    according to van Eijk. <br>
                    <br>
                    The hospitality industry has also gained significantly by 
                    the festival. Some of the leading hotels in Qatar have 
                    reported that they are nearing 100 per cent room occupancy 
                    for the month of July, as the country celebrates the QSW 
                    2004. The top hotels, which include, Movenpick and 
                    InterContinental, pointed out that demand for rooms was so 
                    high that the hotels were working round-the-clock to 
                    accommodate as many visitors as possible. Others hotels such 
                    as Al-Sadd Merweb and Mercure also have high occupancy 
                    figures due to the number of performers, organisers and 
                    international media staying in these hotels.<br>
                    <br>
                    Top hotels such as Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Marriott, Ramada 
                    and Movenpick have slashed their room rates by more than 50 
                    per cent and are offering attractive packages to suit budget 
                    visitors. Most hoteliers believe that, unlike the past, 
                    summers have become a time for good business. The festival 
                    has given a fillip to the sagging hospitality industry 
                    during the lean summer months. &quot;With QSW, we reinforce our 
                    commitment to play an important role in further establishing 
                    this region's unique stature as a business and tourist 
                    destination,'' comments Yousef Ali Darwish, deputy general 
                    manager, Movenpick.<br>
                    <br>
                    Keeping in mind the economic potential of QSW, top players 
                    in the private and public sectors are increasingly becoming 
                    a part of the event. Most of them, whether in the 
                    hospitality, retail or airline industry, have extended their 
                    enthusiastic support to the event.<br>
                    <br>
                    QSW 2004 had progressed extremely well during its opening 
                    weeks. &quot;I am very excited about the wide range of activities 
                    that blend the modern with tradition that we have been able 
                    to offer people in Qatar this summer. All the malls are 
                    featuring professional artists and the Doha Asian Games 
                    Organising Committee's stalls have also reported that they 
                    have enrolled 3,000 volunteers, which proves that the 
                    festival is a huge success. The star attraction, the 
                    &quot;Holiday on Ice&quot; show, has drawn huge crowds too,'' says 
                    Fred Van Eijk.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to Qatar Tourism Development Company, QSW will 
                    have a major impact on the tourism sector in the years to 
                    come. &quot;There is no doubt that there is a tremendous amount 
                    of work ahead of us, but we are confident we can bring good 
                    ideas to life,'' said David Tewelde, GM, QGTA. <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though Qatar is a fairly new entrant in the field of 
                    summer festivals, it has launched QSW at the right time if 
                    the country's tourism industry has to flourish. As Tewelde 
                    sums up, &quot;This is especially important as other countries in 
                    the region are also aggressively chasing tourist dollars. 
                    The good news is that Qatar, which is fairly new to the 
                    tourism industry, has little to lose but much to gain and a 
                    huge desire and political will to develop this sector''. <br>

                    Tourism is Bahrain's fastest growing industry, accounting 
                    for more than 10 per cent of GDP, and close to 20 per cent 
                    of the workforce. Some 4.4 million tourists visited Bahrain 
                    in 2001, which is an increase of 33 per cent over 2000, 
                    generating BD237 million (RO242.06 million). Leisure 
                    tourists comprise the largest segment of visitors to 
                    Bahrain, and the government has identified the development 
                    of new tourism facilities and the upgrading of existing ones 
                    as priority investments for both the public and the private 
                    sector. <br>

                    a medium-term goal of increasing the contribution of tourism 
                    to 20 per cent of GDP and expanding the average stay per 
                    person from 2.2 days to 5 days, nearly $2 billion (RO769 
                    million) worth of large-scale tourism projects have been 
                    launched since 2000. Bahrain's Muharraq Summer Festival (MSF) 
                    2004, an event being organised by a private undertaking, the 
                    Muharraq Communal Society under the patronage of His Majesty 
                    King Hamad, is one such venture to promote tourism in the 
                    region. <br>
                    <br>
                    MSF is in line with the directives of the Kingdom's 
                    leadership to promote high standard tourism, and the 
                    government is keen on supporting any projects that benefits 
                    the economy of the country. &quot;The festival will positively 
                    contribute to the tourism, economic and trade sectors in 
                    Bahrain,'' said Information Minister Nabeel Al Hamer while 
                    praising the role of the private sector in sponsoring such 
                    important events.<br>
                    <br>
                    MSF 2004 will be held from August 5 to September 4, and is 
                    expected to be a big hit among local and regional visitors. 
                    This year, the organisers expect that the festival will 
                    attract more than a million people. To make the festival a 
                    big success, more than $2 million (BD756,000; RO769,230) has 
                    been invested in organising activities for the event. &quot;All 
                    activities featured in the festival from Europe and the 
                    region have been booked at a cost of more than $2 million,'' 
                    said festival director-general Ghazwan Al Masri. <br>
                    <br>
                    A media campaign highlighting the festival's activities has 
                    been launched in all parts of Bahrain and GCC states. More 
                    than 2,000 billboards have been put up around the country 
                    and media campaigns are being carried out in the Eastern 
                    Province of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE and Oman. 
                    To keep the event accessible for everyone, the entry fee to 
                    the festival has been kept minimal. &quot;All tickets will be 
                    sold for 500 fils (510 baisas) and will be entered in a 
                    daily raffle draw with cars and other attractive gifts on 
                    offer,'' pointed out Al Masri. <br>
                    <br>
                    The country's private sector is actively involved in the 
                    fest. Hotels and airlines have offered attractive packages 
                    for both local and foreign visitors. The organising 
                    committee of the festival has prepared special recreational 
                    and cultural activities to attract as many visitors as 
                    possible. From air acrobats, bicycle stunt shows, circus, 
                    women's car rally, hot air balloons, 3D cinema, synchronised 
                    swimming and shows by the strongest man to concerts 
                    featuring popular Arab singers will be a part of the 
                    festival. Popular personalities like Wade'e Al Safi, Raghib 
                    Alama, Wa'el Kafoori, Fadhl Shakir and Bassim Afghani have 
                    been booked to perform at the festival. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the first week of July, more than 35,000 visitors took 
                    part in activities being held at the Muharraq Garden as a 
                    part of the festival. Even though such events give an 
                    opportunity to spend time with friends and relatives and 
                    have a good time, Bahrain's summer fest also aims to support 
                    charitable cause. Money raised from the event will be used 
                    by the society to help poor families living in Muharraq and 
                    in the renovation of crumbling homes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Keeping in mind the overwhelming response that the Muharraq 
                    Summer Festival 2004 has received, the authorities are 
                    planning to make it a national event. &quot;We are planning to 
                    make this event a national event next year rather than 
                    restricting it to Muharraq only,'' said event co-ordinator 
                    Essa Sayyar. This can further increase the tourist inflow 
                    into the country. <br>

                    Tourism is a relatively untapped industry in Kuwait. Most 
                    visitors coming to the country are on business rather than 
                    leisure trips. Business visitors account over 90 per cent of 
                    travellers coming to the country. Reason: the lack of 
                    attractions, which are essential for the development of a 
                    leisure tourism industry. Oil production being the dominant 
                    economic activity in the country, developing the tourism 
                    sector has not been the primary agenda of the government.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="im29.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="200" height="131">However, 
                    things have fairly changed for the oil rich country after 
                    its entry into the World Tourism Organisation. According to 
                    recent data available from the Organisation, visitor traffic 
                    to Kuwait was 77,000 in 1998, which has increased each year 
                    since then. International tourism receipts have also 
                    increased year on year with the 1999 figures at US$243 
                    million (RO93.46 million). <br>
                    <br>
                    Although late, there is an increasing awareness to boost 
                    tourism in the country by attracting non-business visitors 
                    to the country. The Kuwait Tourism Services Company (KTSC), 
                    which was set up to promote the country in both regional and 
                    overseas markets together with the Kuwait Hotels 
                    Association, Kuwait Airlines, the Ministry of Information 
                    and other industry stakeholders, is working to diversify 
                    Kuwait's visitor profile. The development of resorts and 
                    shopping attractions and cultural and entertainment 
                    extravaganza to entice leisure traveller underline the 
                    increasing importance being accorded to the tourism sector. 
                    One such step towards attracting potential fun seeking 
                    visitors was the introduction of the Hala Shopping Festival 
                    in 1999. <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike the other constituents of the GCC, Kuwait organises 
                    its most popular event, the Hala Festival in the month of 
                    February. The first Hala Fest was an absolute success. It 
                    boosted the hotel and retail sectors and since then has 
                    become an annual event. Not only in its timing is Kuwait's 
                    fest different from its partner countries but also in its 
                    objective. Whereas countries like Oman and the UAE aim to 
                    attract visitors from all over the world, the main market 
                    for the Hala Festival remains the GCC. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Hala Shopping Festival offers a great mix of 
                    entertainment and shopping. According to official figures, 
                    visitor traffic during Hala Festival 2000 improved by 5 per 
                    cent in comparison to the inaugural festival in 1999. The 
                    festival is expected to boost the Kuwaiti economy and around 
                    100,000 foreign tourists visited the country during the Hala 
                    Festival in 2003. <br>
                    <br>
                    February is a perfect time to visit Kuwait, especially when 
                    Hala Festival is in full swing. The arrival of migratory 
                    birds and seasonal animals during this time adds further 
                    attractions. This month-long celebration of cultural and 
                    entertainment extravaganza offers a great opportunity for 
                    young and old alike to participate in various events like 
                    the kaleidoscope show and shopping carnivals etc. It is also 
                    an opportune time to win prizes at the many raffles and 
                    contests held during the period. <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though Kuwait's Hala Festival is making a valuable 
                    contribution to the promotion of the country, the event 
                    still hasn't made a dent into the other regional shopping 
                    events. What is needed here is proper marketing of the 
                    event. &quot;Our regional neighbours have proved that marketing 
                    really can work, and it is up to all of us in the tourism 
                    and hospitality sector to position Kuwait as a multi-faceted 
                    country, one that has considerably more to offer than just 
                    the Kuwait Towers, the usual image in people's minds,'' says 
                    Hannes Yaghi of Le Meridien hotel.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;The wealth of entertainments now available in Kuwait is one 
                    of the Gulf's best kept secrets. The drama shows, sports, 
                    arts and crafts, photography exhibitions and music concerts 
                    that form part of the Hala Festival have much potential to 
                    attract tourists,'' he added. If promoted properly, the Hala 
                    Fest in the long run can make Kuwait a much sought-after 
                    tourist destination.'</font></p>

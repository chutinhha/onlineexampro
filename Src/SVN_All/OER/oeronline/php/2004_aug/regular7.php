            42-inch VIERA series TH-42PX25U/P provides flat-panel, big-screen 
            luxury. This 1,024 x 768-pixel gas-plasma TV offers a 16:9 
            widescreen dimension, photo-viewing SD and PC Card slots, and an 
            HDMI input for direct-digital connection with high-definition 
            sources. The set's authorised CableCARD ability means the set will 
            also receive digital cable television systems services directly from 
            the cable operator without requiring a bulky, external cable box.<br>
            <br>
            With a plasma screen you get vivid colours, extremely wide viewing 
            angles (wider even than those of most LCD screens), and easy 
            placement due to a plasma monitor's slim profile Ð the TH-42PX25U/P 
            is a mere 5.5 inches deep, perfect for desk or wall mounting. 
            Brightness tends to be extremely uniform across plasma screens, 
            which are also impervious to the picture distortion and negative 
            colour balances that afflict CRT monitors when placed near lighting 
            or sound systems. <br>
            <br>
            The TH-42PX25U/P's contrast ratio is rated at an 
            extraordinarily lifelike 3,000:1, and the TV is capable of producing 
            over 1 billion colours. Picture-enhancing technologies include the 
            Mach Band Effect Enhancer, a Gamma Enhancement System, and 
            Panasonic's New Real Black Drive System. <br>

            turn just about any room into a luscious home theatre. The set's 
            native resolution is 1,366x768, and its direct-digital DVI input 
            works with compatible high-definition DTV set-top boxes and PCs. 
            There's also a standard RGB computer input. A built-in analog tuner, 
            a pedestal stand, and a generous array of audio/video connections

            this set--1,000 cd/sq m--delivers exceptional detail even in 
            well-lit rooms. It also has a 1000:1 contrast ratio for increased 
            picture depth, which results in greater dimensionality and a less

            function (soft, natural, rich, personal, and multimedia), 
            picture-in-picture mode (PIP), tri-mode tint control, and a fanless

            a built-in 181-channel tuner although you will need an HDTV tuner to 
            receive high-definition broadcasts. The 30-watt RMS stereo speakers

            I am a Chemistry graduate, having done my BSc (Chemistry) from 
            Saurashtra University in Gujarat, India, in 1970. Frankly speaking, 
            I joined Muscat Pharmacy immediately after that and have been with 
            it ever since. So, there are no job-hoppings as might be the case 
            with some other executives. I joined as assistant to my elder 
            brother -- B.S. Mehta -- when there was just one branch of the 
            company. From then on, I've grown with the company, and am the 
            deputy managing director of Muscat Pharmacy today.</font></p>

            our readers about the corporate and management structure of Muscat 
            Pharmacy...<br>
            </b>Muscat Pharmacy was established as a partnership in 1968 with a 
            nominal paid-up capital. The aim of the partnership was to import, 
            sell and distribute medicines and medical products and equipment in 
            order to make the same readily available in the country. From a 
            single outlet company, Muscat Pharmacy has today evolved into a 
            multi-million rial turnover company with over 60 branches spread all 
            over the Sultanate. The day-to-day management of the company is 
            conducted by B.S. Mehta, the managing director of Muscat Pharmacy, 
            in accordance with the policies laid down by, and under the 
            directions and guidance of, the partners. The MD is assisted by the 
            deputy managing director -- that's me -- besides other departmental 
            managers and executives.

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What does your 
            role entail? </b><br>
            Besides overseeing the general overall management of all the 
            branches of Muscat Pharmacy across the country, I look after the 
            total private market business.

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What are the 
            challenges that the pharmacy business faces in Oman?</b> <br>
            Private participation in the country's healthcare sector is growing, 
            and it is likely to grow further. Pharmacies have the responsibility 
            to ensure that requirements of the expanded private sector are met 
            in terms of different types of medication and/or surgical devices. 
            Timely availability of medicines and medical products is necessary, 
            especially as these are not manufactured in the country. In fact, in 
            some cases, it is a question of life and death for patients. The 
            challenge is to be aware of the responsibility of the pharmacies in 
            such situations and be ready to meet the task head on.
                    </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>How does your 
            company try and overcome these challenges?</b> <br>
            Muscat Pharmacy is geared to meet challenges that come from urgent 
            requirements of life-saving drugs from government institutions and 
            the private sector. As a policy, the company maintains certain 
            quantity of most of such products in stock, and in other instances, 
            stocks are obtained in the shortest possible time using the quickest 
            mode. For such matters, the company works 24x7, and special staff 
            are deployed for the purpose. Necessary statutory permissions for 
            drugs not registered in Oman are also taken on urgent basis as and 
            when the need arises.

            Pharmacy was recently honoured with the coveted Golden Caduceus 
            Award. Could you share with our readers the merits of the award? </b>
            <br>
            The award was conferred upon Muscat Pharmacy by the Chamber of 
            Commerce and Industry of Meurthe and Moselle, France, in recognition 
            of its outstanding contribution to promoting trade relations between 
            Oman and France for over 20 years. It is matter of great honour for 
            the Sultanate that, in the history of the award, this was the first 
            time that it was presented to a company outside Europe. Not only 
            that, it was also the first time that the ceremony was held outside 
            Europe, in Oman. We are extremely proud of this international honour 
            and recognition. <br>
            The award is presented by the French chamber to individuals and 
            organisations who have distinguished themselves in their fields and 
            to those who have shown outstanding performance over a period of 
            time in terms of efficiency, growth and who have excelled themselves 
            in their fields. The award was presented to Muscat Pharmacy by 
            Jean-Michel Laurent, the CEO of the French chamber, in the presence 
            of the French ambassador-designate to the Sultanate and other 
            dignitaries from the French Trade Commission and the Oman Chamber of 
            Commerce &amp; Industry at a solemn ceremony held at Oman Sheraton 
            Hotel.

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Are spurious 
            drugs available in Oman? How can customers avoid falling into this 
            trap?</b><br>
            While there is, indeed, a parallel market for consumer products in 
            the country, we don't believe that spurious drugs are available in 
            the country since there is an extremely efficient system that the 
            government has in place. As far as detecting duplicate consumer 
            products are concerned, sometimes it is even difficult for those in 
            the business to differentiate between a genuine and a replica 
            product by just looking at the packaging. As a customer, one should 
            always insist on an authenticated receipt of the products bought, 
            and serious doubts about the genuineness of a product should be 
            immediately reported to the Royal Oman Police.

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What goes on in 
            the day-to-day management of such a large chain of pharmacies in the 
            country?</b> <br>
            The company has various divisions within it -- retail, wholesale, 
            engineering, etc -- and every division has a person in charge of it, 
            who is responsible for the efficient working of his or her division. 
            On top of that, all our branches are networked - technology is a big 
            enabler of information flow, and there is a well-defined system in 
            place which works very well. That's how we keep track of the 
            business in real-time basis. Moreover, we have our weekly and 
            monthly review meetings, and management-staff interactions are 
            fairly regular. Having said that, I'd like to emphasise that we are 
            a family organisation, and by that I mean that every employee 
            working in our company is like a family member. We follow an 'open 
            doors' policy, wherein any employee facing a problem -- be it 
            personal or official -- can walk into any of our rooms and we make 
            all efforts to address his or her issues.

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>According to 
            you, what is better - medication or meditation? Why? <br>
            </b>To be very honest, prevention is always better than cure. So, 
            under normal circumstances, meditation is indeed better than 
            medication. However, when one suffers from a disease, more often 
            than not, it's cured through medication. So, use meditation to 
            prevent diseases, but if that doesn't happen, medication is the only 
            alternative!  </font></p>

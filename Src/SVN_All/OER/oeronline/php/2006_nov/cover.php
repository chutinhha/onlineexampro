            <font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman’s insurance sector is going through a transitional phase with 
            more players entering the market, even as national firms are 
            strengthening their capital base to compete in a liberalized 
            environment. After Oman’s entry in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), 
            several regional players consider the country as a potential market.<br>
            <br>
            Few multinationals that had been operating through agency agreements 
            have strengthened their position by forming joint ventures with 
            local partners, while others are set to float new insurance firms to 
            grab a slice of the RO117 million premium income. <br>
            <br>
            <b>New Entrant</b><br>
            The latest company to enter the fray is Al Madina Gulf Insurance 
            Company, which is promoted by four <br>
            <br>
            pan-GCC investors in association with local partners. With a capital 
            base of RO10 million, the joint venture firm is promoted by 
            Bahrain-based Solidarity, Qatar–based Doha Bank and Qatar Islamic 
            Insurance and Oman’s MB Petroleum, Al Madina Financial and 
            Investment, Diwan of Royal Court, Transgulf Co and Ministry of 
            Defence Pension Fund. <br>
            <br>
            The three foreign promoters have a combined stake of 25 per cent in 
            the joint venture. To start with, the newly floated firm will offer 
            general insurance products. But it has a CMA licence for both life 
            and non-life businesses.<br>
            <br>
            It was only last year that Al Anwar Holding formed a joint venture 
            general insurance firm with a capital base of RO5 million. The new 
            firm — Falcon Insurance — was established by taking over the Muscat 
            branch operation of a Lebanese firm — Al Ittihad Al Watani. The move 
            is viewed as an attempt by Al Anwar (which has 30 per cent or RO1.5 
            million equity stake in Falcon Insurance) to strengthen its position 
            in insurance field, after the collapse of its associate — ONIC 
            Insurance — few years ago.<br>
            <br>
            After the collapse of ONIC Insurance, few regional and multinational 
            players strengthened their position in the Sultanate. For instance, 
            Royal &amp; SunAlliance formed a joint venture with two Omani partners — 
            W J Towell &amp; Co and Oman Holding International (OHI) — to strengthen 
            its position in the local market. The company was operating in the 
            country for three decades through an agency agreement with W J 
            Towell. Oman Qatar Insurance Company is another major player that 
            entered the Sultanate to get a slice of the market.</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Booming Market</b><br>
            It is not far to seek the reasons for the recent enthusiasm. The low 
            insurance penetration in the country, a vacuum created in the 
            insurance sector following the collapse of ONIC Insurance, better 
            growth in gross domestic product, the recent boom in gas-based 
            industries and the peculiar demographic feature are all cited as 
            positive factors for a better demand for insurance products. Direct 
            insurance premium income (of both life and non-life insurance) rose 
            by 14.9 per cent to touch RO117.27 million in 2005, over the 
            previous year, according to data released by the Capital Market 
            Authority (CMA). Of this, direct premium of general insurance sector 
            soared by 15.6 per cent to RO100.75 million, while life insurance 
            sector showed a moderate 5.3 per cent growth at RO16.52 million in 
            2005 over the previous year.<br>
            <br>
            Likewise, the aggregate assets of insurance companies soared by 19 
            per cent to RO208.41 million by end-2005 over the previous year. Of 
            this, the assets of non-life segment moved up by 23.2 per cent to 
            RO157.99 million, while assets of life segment rose by 6.7 per cent 
            to RO50.42 million.<br>
            <br>
            The insurance penetration in Oman is relatively low at less than two 
            per cent, which is lower than many developing countries. Yet another 
            factor that could lead to a better demand for insurance product is 
            the fast development of gas-based industries, especially at the 
            emerging Sohar Industrial hub. It is estimated that capital 
            investment worth more than US$12 billion is being pumped in Sohar 
            alone for building various gas-based industries. But most of the 
            benefits from these projects accrue to national companies as 
            partially state-owned companies prefer national companies for their 
            insurance needs. <br>
            <br>
            As far as the demographic feature of Oman is concerned, around 55 
            per cent of the Sultanate’s population is under 20 years of age and 
            nearly a third of them are students. This is another positive factor 
            that could help the growth of life insurance segment in the coming 
            years.</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">Industry sources said that after the 
            fall down of ONIC Insurance, there was a vacuum in the general 
            insurance segment. The regulators have brought in new stipulations 
            after the collapse, which was blamed for undercutting and poor 
            reinsurance practices. In fact, the liquidation of ONIC Insurance 
            prompted CMA to bring in several stringent norms to check unhealthy 
            practices in an apparent move to strengthen the financial position 
            of existing players. Accordingly, the insurance regulator has 
            brought in a new code of corporate governance, besides prohibiting 
            consultancy and direct insurance broking of brokers with reinsurance 
            broking services for the same client. Also, the regulating authority 
            is in an advanced stage of announcing important amendments to 
            Insurance Companies Law in conformity with international standards 
            and principles.<br>
            <br>
            With more firms entering the field, existing players are 
            strengthening their capital base. For instance, the total paid up 
            capital of national insurance companies shot up by 35.5 per cent to 
            RO49.8 million in 2005 from RO36.75 million for the previous year. 
            This growth is attributed to raising of capital by Oman United 
            Insurance Company (OUIC), Dhofar Insurance Company, Royal &amp; Sun 
            Alliance Insurance and National Life. OUIC is further raising its 
            capital from RO8 million to RO10 million by floating a rights issue, 
            as strong capital base is required for surviving in a liberalized 
            environment. With a premium of 100 basias, the share is offered at 
            200 basias. The additional capital will help the company to compete 
            with international firms. </font></p>

            Motor insurance segment constitutes the single largest business of 
            local companies. As far as the national companies are concerned, 
            motor insurance constitutes around 47 per cent of total premium 
            income in 2005 as against 52 per cent in the previous year. In the 
            case of foreign companies, motor segment constituted 44 per cent of 
            total premium income in 2005 as against 38 per cent in the previous 
            year, said CMA in its report on Insurance Market Review. </font></p>
            <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
            <font face="Verdana" size="1">But the claims-to-premium ratio of 
            motor insurance is relatively high when compared to other countries. 
            If all companies apply good underwriting practices and penalise poor 
            driving, there will be less accidents on Oman’s roads. In a way, 
            better drivers subsidise poor drivers who in many cases enjoy 
            similar rating, which is not in line with good underwriting 
            practices.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Major Players</b><br>
            The country’s insurance market is mainly dominated by five national 
            companies — Dhofar Insurance, Al Ahlia Insurance, Muscat Insurance, 
            Oman United Insurance Company and National Life. With an employee 
            strength of 741 people, the national companies generated a combined 
            insurance premium income of RO92.3 million in 2005. Of this, RO80.29 
            million was from general insurance segment.<br>
            <br>
            Of late, life insurance companies are focusing on medical insurance 
            as a growth area in the coming years. The segment is poised for 
            rapid growth in the region as GCC governments are gradually 
            withdrawing from healthcare sector. In Oman alone, the premium from 
            the segment is expected to touch RO25 million with in a period of 
            two to three years. Expatriates are encouraged to go to private 
            clinics and hospitals, if the case is not an emergency, which 
            created a big market for both clinics and insurance companies. As 
            fast industrialization is taking place at Sohar, the demand for 
            medical insurance products is expected to pick up in the coming 
            years. </font></p>

            <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
            <font face="Verdana" size="1">Also, there is a need for medical insurance products in developing 
            countries like Oman as the cost of medical expenses has been 
            increasing year after year. In many countries, the government 
            agencies are gradually withdrawing from the healthcare sector due to 
            mounting cost and the responsibility is being gradually taken up by 
            insurers world over and the same phenomenon is observed in the Gulf 
            region.<br>
            <br>
            National Life — the largest life insurance firm in the Sultanate — 
            consider medical insurance products as a growth area. In line with 
            the strategy, the company has launched various products to suit 
            different requirements of the people. Apart from inpatient and 
            outpatient coverage in Oman, National Life offers treatment in 
            Indian sub-continent and Europe. The company also made it convenient 
            for patients by tying up with 25 clinics across the country. With 
            this, the insured employees of companies can choose from several 
            clinics spread across the country. <br>
            <br>
            As expected, liberalization of this sector has helped bring about 
            several positive developments, including use of innovative channels 
            for distribution. Bankassurance — marketing of insurance products by 
            commercial banks — is also picking up in recent years. This helps 
            the insurance companies to market their products effectively in 
            remote areas where banks have branch operation. Oman International 
            Bank (OIB) has tied up with Muscat Insurance for marketing the 
            latter’s product.<br>
            <br>
            Insurance-linked auto-finance is another opportunity for local 
            companies to tap. Last year, United Finance Company and Oman United 
            Insurance Company have jointly launched an insurance-linked auto 
            finance scheme. Both companies have joined together in an agency 
            partnership agreement, which has an impact on the personal lines 
            insurance products are marketed in the country. The insurance policy 
            built into the loan provides comprehensive coverage and it covers 
            the full tenure of the loan. With the insurance built into the loan, 
            the customer does not have the hassle of making separate insurance 
            payment. </font></p>

            Industry sources admit that lack of a specialised training college 
            is an important problem, which is of importance in view of high 
            level of Omanisation in insurance sector. Leaders of the industry 
            suggest formation of a training institute like the College of 
            Banking and Financial Studies. The institute can be a joint 
            initiative of the government and private sector. <br>
            <br>
            The insurance industry worldwide has undergone remarkable structural 
            changes in recent years while facing even greater exposure to market 
            uncertainty. Ineffective market discipline is one of the issues 
            identified by the Association of Insurance Regulator as a threat to 
            the emerging markets. This is an issue that has to be effectively 
            tackled for the healthy growth of the insurance market. While the 
            regulator has a role to play in ensuring market discipline, the role 
            played by the well-informed public in bringing about discipline in 
            the market place cannot be ignored as the key to effective market 
            discipline lies in public disclosure and consumer education.</font></p>

                  INDUSTRY</b></font></p>
                  <p align="justify">
            <font face="Verdana" size="1">The global insurance industry 
                  generates about US$3 trillion in premium income accounting for 
                  more than 8 per cent of global GDP. The industry has weathered 
                  much turbulence in the last five years. Terrorism attack 
                  (9/11), natural catastrophes (Katrina and Tsunami) and major 
                  accidents have severely affected the bottomlines of many 
                  insurance companies. Some have been wiped out completely. 
                  Simultaneously the industry faced the challenge of adjusting 
                  to a new financial markets paradigm characterized by low 
                  fixed-income yields and less vibrant stock markets. The 
                  imperative of generating profits from core underwriting 
                  activities is widely accepted and industry executives have so 
                  far not succumbed to the temptation of relaxing underwriting 
                  standards in a more competitive environment. In many lines of 
                  business, premium growth is slowing down in the wake of 
                  cyclically weakening premium rates. CEOs face the task of 
                  steering their companies through a phase of retrenchment.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
                  The task in front of insurance companies is not going to be 
                  easy. By 2050, mega-catastrophes, which used to occur every 
                  100 years, are predicted to happen once every 25. The UN has 
                  also predicted that losses will then be 900 per cent higher 
                  than they are today.<br>
                  <br>
                  CEOs have to work from the premise that investment yields will 
                  remain low for the foreseeable future. This dictates an 
                  unconditional adherence to underwriting profitability and 
                  requires major adjustments to business models. Liability 
                  claims inflation (in excess of economic inflation) is 
                  continuing unabated. A necessary condition for coping with 
                  these challenges is a thorough and sometimes radical review of 
                  the insurance value chain, ranging from product design to 
                  claims management.</font></td>

                  There has been a record growth of the Omani industries which 
                  have cruised through success throughout these years. The 
                  demand for insurance policies and products have also gained a 
                  rising momentum with the rapid growth of Oman’s GDP, expansion 
                  of the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors, development of 
                  tourist projects and the opening up of the market in general. 
                  On the other hand, the simultaneous efforts by the Capital 
                  Market Authority and insurance companies have helped the 
                  sectors witness positive developments. <br>
                  <br>
                  Furthermore with the insurance market in Oman at its growing 
                  stage, the awareness about the general laws and fair practices 
                  among the local people is very important. The CMA no doubt 
                  plays a major role in contributing responsiveness towards the 
                  people in insurance companies in Oman.<br>

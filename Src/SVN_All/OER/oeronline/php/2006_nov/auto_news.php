        BMW – just a click away<br>
        <img border="0" src="pic33.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="101"></b>There’s good news for all BMW lovers. BMW Group Middle East has 
        launched its innovative website, BMW-ME.COM, an innovative in-depth 
        portal giving customers an interactive and enhanced BMW experience. <br>
        <br>
        BMW-ME.COM provides extensive information and full specifications of all 
        BMW vehicles, accessories and pre-owned vehicles. In addition, customers 
        can access the site to download the BMW owner service and warranty 
        manual, catch up on the latest BMW innovations and source details on the 
        BMW Group Middle East’s importer network across the region. <br>
        <br>
        The website also features interesting sections right from the Innovative 
        Lounge — where all questions on Active Steering and xDrive are answered 
        and remotely experienced to the Technology Guide, which provides concise 
        and in-depth explanations on all the latest innovations and safety 
        systems available in BMW cars. BMW Group Middle East has more reasons to 
        celebrate as 2006 seems to be another record sales year with BMW Q3 
        deliveries to customers in the region up by 12 per cent year on year. 
        Inspite of major political and social problems in the region, retail 
        sales of BMW Group Middle East vehicles were 3606 units in the period 
        July to September 2006, with the new BMW 7 Series, BMW 5 Series, BMW X5 
        and BMW 3 Series driving growth.<br>
        <br>
        Oman is the fastest growing market in the Gulf Cooperation Council 
        region with sales accelerating ahead by 30 per cent, compared to the 
        same period in 2005, followed by Qatar, which is 17 per cent up. Dubai 
        also saw a rise in sales in the third quarter of this year. And adding 
        to this excitement is the launch in the fourth quarter of two new models 
        — the BMW M6 Convertible and the BMW X3 LCI, followed by the phenomenal 
        launch of the new BMW X5 and the new MINI in 2007. <br>

        <b>FORD’S X MACHINE</b><br>
        Ford recently unveiled its latest concept car — the iosis X. The 
        cross-over of an SUV, the iosis X comes under the CUV category. Designed 
        to look like one solid sculpted piece of metal, the iosis X can truly be 
        considered a rolling work of art. The iosis X retains many of the 
        trapezoidal shapes found in the original iosis concept car, and its 
        overall shape somehow manages to retain an athletic grace while still 
        looking like an iosis pumped up on steroids. The iosis X is a proper 
        five-door crossover, and like many concept cars these days, the doors 
        open just like the suicide doors found on a 1964 Lincoln. With the iosis 
        X being a concept, its interior is appropriately loud and funky.<br>

        Captiva, which heralds the introduction of a new generation of Chevrolet

        <br>
        The Captiva scores high where styling is concerned with a spacious, 
        convenient interior that’s made with high quality fabrics and materials.

        variants are available with a comprehensive package of standard and 
        available features. From the entry level 2.4 litre four cylinder LS to 
        the fully equipped 3.2 litre six cylinder LTZ, the 2007 Captiva leaves 
        nothing to be desired at any level. With its dynamic sporty design, the 
        highly anticipated Captiva will add a new dimension to the compact SUV 
        segment offering superior levels of comfort, versatility and 
        performance. It is aimed at Middle Eastern families and outgoing 
        customers looking for a practical load carrier with style, soft-road

        <b>MADE IN SOUTH AFRICA</b><br>
        <img border="0" src="pic27.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="125" height="55">General Motors recently started the production of HUMMER H3 at its 
        Struandale Assembly Facility in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. The 
        occasion represents an important step in the global expansion of HUMMER 
        by providing increased capacity and a global version of the H3 for 
        markets outside North America. <br>
        <br>
        Maureen Kempston Darkes, president of GM Latin America, Africa and the 
        Middle East said, “The GM team in South Africa has demonstrated to the 
        world that they have the people, the leadership, the technology and the 
        skills to execute the type of automobile engineering and assembly that 
        is required in the new global economy.” <br>
        <br>
        HUMMER H3 vehicles built in South Africa will be exported to markets in 
        Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Production of a right-hand drive 
        version will begin in the second quarter of 2007 for export into 
        right-hand markets in Europe and Asia as well as for local sale in South 
        Africa. <br>

        <b>A SAFE DRIVE FROM SUBARU </b><br>
        The All-Wheel Drive Subaru Forester has ranked highest in Used Car 
        Safety Ratings (UCSR) in a report that was made public recently. For the 
        first time in the study’s 15-year history, a ‘standout’ car was 
        identified, with Subaru’s Forester rating as top performer. <br>
        <br>
        The UCSR is the world’s largest study of vehicle crashes and is 
        conducted by the Monash University Accident Research Centre and 
        supported by the RACV, the Transport Accident Commission (TAC), and 
        VicRoads, as well as other state and federal road authorities and 
        motoring clubs from Australia and New Zealand. <br>
        <br>
        Subaru Liberty and Outback were also named as vehicles offering well 
        above average protection to their drivers in a crash. Like Forester, 
        current generation Liberty and Outback also have five-star ANCAP 
        crashworthiness ratings for occupant safety. <br>

        <b>ACCENT IN A NEW DESIGN</b><br>
        A redesigned Accent awaits all Hyundai enthusiasts. The auto company has 
        totally revamped the Accent, with new styling, new interior, more 
        powerful engine, sophisticated suspension, and more standard safety 
        equipment.<br>
        <br>
        The Accent’s 1.6-liter 4-cylinder DOHC engine, with continuously 
        variable valve timing, now produces 112 bhp and while it idles quietly 
        and cruises in relative silence, under hard acceleration it definitely 
        makes itself heard.<br>
        <br>
        The 2007 Accent offers more interior roominess and remarkably large 
        trunk space thanks to a taller stance. It has a handsome, rounded 
        profile featuring a roofline that sweeps from hood to trunk in one long 
        curve. Accent comes with a 4-speed automatic, which is more than ample 
        for most folk. It has better fuel mileage on the highway.<br>

        <b>Proceed with Kia</b><br>
        <img border="0" src="pic26.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="125" height="84">Kia Motors’ latest concept car pro_cee’d debuted at the Paris Motor Show 
        later this month. The strikingly styled showcar is based on the 
        forthcoming three-door ‘sporty hatch’ version of the all-new Kia cee’d 
        C-segment model. This five-door family hatchback will be manufactured at 
        Kia’s first-ever European assembly plant in Slovakia from November 2006.
        <br>
        <br>
        Following on from the original cee’d concept car exhibited at the Geneva 
        Show earlier this year, Kia’s brief to the designers for pro_cee’d was 
        to create a ‘teaser’ for the all-new Kia cee’d ‘sporty hatch’ which will 
        become the third model in the cee’d line-up (after the five-door and 
        wagon) from December 2007. The pro_cee’d looks similar to Kia’s new 
        cee’d ‘sporty hatch’ model with its dynamic and masculine nature. The 
        wheels are a two-part design, featuring five double-spokes arranged with 
        a recessed black power-coated centre and brightly polished convex 
        perimeter spokes. Key attributes, which the pro_cee’d and ‘sporty hatch’ 
        models will have in common, include the lowered roof line (down by 25 mm 
        compared to the five-door cee’d) and shallower side windows ringed in 
        chrome trim that creates a robustly sporty window graphic.<br>

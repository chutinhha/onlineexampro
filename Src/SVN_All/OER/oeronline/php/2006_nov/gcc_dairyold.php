        <b>The GCC countries need to pull up their socks in matters of corporate 
        governance, reports Sowmya Sri Rallabhandi citing the recent 
        IIF-Hawkamah survey report<br>
        </b><br>
        <img border="0" src="pic73.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="125" height="136">When it comes to corporate governance, the GCC countries lag 
        significantly vis-a-vis international corporate governance best 
        practices in the emerging markets. However, regional regulators are 
        pushing hard for reforms so as to lift corporate governance standards. 
        This is the find of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) and 
        Hawkamah — the Institute of Corporate Governance, which have recently 
        come out with the first-ever corporate governance report on GCC 
        countries: Corporate Governance in the GCC — An Investor Perspective.<br>
        <br>
        “The IIF-Hawkamah survey is part of a coordinated strategy towards the 
        harmonisation of corporate governance standards in the GCC and their 
        alignment with international best practices,” said Dr Nasser Al Saidi, 
        Executive Director of Hawkamah. The GCC average for compliance with 
        international best practices is nearly 50 per cent, considerably lower 
        than in other emerging markets — like India’s 75 per cent and about 65 
        per cent in China — cited the IIF.<br>
        <br>
        Oman, says the report, has the strongest corporate governance framework 
        — complying with about 70 per cent of IIF’s guidelines — followed by 
        Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, both with about 50 per cent compliance, and 
        Bahrain and the UAE with 40 per cent compliance of IIF guidelines. <br>
        <br>
        The IIF-Hawkamah survey found that Qatar had the weakest corporate 
        governance framework, and needs a great deal of improvement in its 
        corporate governance as it complies with only 35 per cent of the IIF 
        guidelines — earning the country an overall score of 2 out of 5. The 
        taskforce expects improvement, as the Doha authorities are taking steps 
        to improve governance practices in listed companies.<br>
        <br>
        “The findings of this survey will help GCC policy-makers identify key 
        areas for reform and promote awareness of the benefits good corporate 
        governance brings to companies and markets,” said Dubai International 
        Financial Centre (DIFC) governor Dr. Omar Bin Sulaiman.<br>
        <br>
        Hawkamah executive director Dr. Nasser Saidi said the survey showed that 
        corporate governance in the GCC was generally at an early stage of 
        development. The survey evaluated corporate governance standards across 
        some 56 criteria, falling into five broad categories:<br>

        <br>
        Developments in corporate governance in the GCC have been largely driven 
        by four key factors, says the report. They are: <br>

        Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait have drafted codes, expected to be 
        implemented in 2007.<br>

        Central banks in all six GCC countries have amended their banking 
        regulations to include corporate governance-related requirements such as 
        establishing transparency and disclosure in financial statements, 
        establishment of a board level audit, nomination and compensation 
        committees and improved risk management.<br>

        A strong commitment to better corporate governance from the political 
        authorities as well as from senior government officials involved with 
        capital market development is needed for real change to take effect, the 
        study said.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="pic75.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="125" height="134">Referring to the public sector undertakings, the IIF-Hawkamah report 
        observes that regulators should quickly introduce corporate governance 
        reforms in state controlled companies, which constitute a majority of 
        companies in the GCC.<br>
        <br>
        The report calls for greater cooperation and coordination among 
        regulators in the region to strengthen equity markets in the GCC. With 
        the exception of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, equity markets in the region 
        are relatively small and lack depth of listings. The IIF-Hawkamah 
        taskforce calls for the creation of a regional GCC corporate governance 
        task force comprised of regulators and market participants with the 
        mandate to harmonise capital market laws, promote cross listing of 
        stocks on exchanges across GCC with the objective of creating unified 
        GCC equity market.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Saidi said reforms were being carried out across the region and 
        regulators were using the recent price correction in GCC stock markets 
        to upgrade corporate governance frameworks. Bahrain is revising its 
        company law and will shortly introduce a corporate governance code. 
        Saudi Arabia issued a draft corporate governance code in August on which 
        it has invited comments and will shortly enforce one for listed 
        companies. In Oman, the Muscat Securities Market is likely to be 
        privatised.<br>
        <br>
        To bring the GCC into compliance with the IIF’s corporate governance 
        code, the report suggests recommendations including:<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="1">&#9679; </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Promote shareholder activism in the region by creating a class of

            US dollar</b><br>
            All the GCC currencies are undervalued against the US dollar, 
            reveals a study by Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry. No wonder 
            Kuwait Central Bank revalued its dinar against the US dollar. The 
            Bahraini Dinar is the most undervalued currency in the GCC 
            countries, and the UAE Dirham is the least undervalued currency. 
            Since 2000, the six GCC undervalued currencies have not undergone 
            any adjustment, neither upwards nor downwards, except the Kuwaiti 
            Dinar that has gone through several adjustments during this period. 
            This indicates that the Kuwaiti Dinar is the least stable GCC 
            currency during recent years, says the report. <br>
            <br>
            The study has used The Economist’s Big Mac Index, based on the 
            relative dollar price of a McDonald’s Big Mac burger in different 
            countries to the US price, to calculate the values of the GCC 
            currencies. For instance, in the UAE a Big Mac costs AED 10. 
            Dividing this by its US price of USD 3.10 produces a dollar PPP 
            (Purchasing Power Parity) against the dirham of AED 3.2258, compared 
            with the current exchange rate of AED 3.6725. This suggests that the 
            dirham is undervalued by 12 per cent. On the other hand, the Kuwaiti 
            Dinar and the Omani Riyal are undervalued by 16 per cent each, the 
            Qatari Riyal is undervalued by 20 per cent, the Saudi Riyal is 
            undervalued by 23 per cent, and the Bahraini Dinar is undervalued by 
            27 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            “A reasonably undervalued currency is good for non-oil re-exports 
            competitiveness, provided that it is not causing other serious 
            economic problems to the economy,” the report comments on whether 
            the currency should undergo revaluation.</font><div align="center">

        <b>Economic issues dominate polls </b><br>
        Economic issues are at the heart of debates among candidates for 
        Bahrain’s parliamentary and municipality elections slated for November 
        25. Tens of men and women are competing for 40 seats in each of 
        parliamentary and municipality councils. The subjects attracting debates 
        include jobs for locals, economic reforms and diversification, to name a 
        few.<br>
        <br>
        One such matter relates to declining representation of Bahraini 
        workforce in private sector jobs. Bahraini nationals accounted for a 
        mere 23 per cent of employment in private establishments in the first 
        quarter of 2006, thereby continuing a disturbing trend. Nationals 
        represented nearly 32 per cent of private sector jobs in 2001 only to 
        decline to 24 per cent in 2005. The issue is vital in the light of 
        greater involvement of the private sector in the economy, thanks to 
        on-going economic reforms that call for limiting public sector role. 
        Eventually, the trend could aggravate unemployment problem in the 
        country, which already stands at least 8 per cent among nationals.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="pic75.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="125" height="134">Still, 
        the process of economic reforms, notably privatisation, is a matter of 
        growing concern. So is the case as increasingly foreign firms assume 
        control of major public assets. This is meant to do away with 
        inefficiency in government-run establishments. Earlier in the year, 
        three foreign firms assumed control of Hidd power and water plant, the 
        primary utility complex in the country. Yet, recently, an international 
        firm won a 25-year contract to manage Bahrain’s ports services, namely 
        Mina Salman in Manama and Khalifa bin Salman in Hidd (which is under 
        construction). Thus, candidates expressed fears about job prospects, as 
        profit-seeking firms assume greater role in the economy. <br>
        <br>
        The third problem concerns poverty. The United Nations Development 
        Programme (UNDP) considers a Bahraini family, comprising six members, as 
        poor if monthly income falls below US$936. Many Bahraini families rely 
        on support extended by the Ministry of Social Development -- and more 
        importantly, on charitable associations scattered throughout the nation. 
        Relatively strong population growth of more than 2.5 per cent puts more 
        pressure on the poverty debacle in the Kingdom. A number of election 
        candidates have made improving living conditions of citizens a key poll 
        promise. The fourth economic concern deals with solving the housing 
        problem. Many nationals depend on government-subsidized facilities to 
        solve their housing problem. However, newspapers speak of more than 
        40,000 pending applications for various types of loans extended by 
        state-owned Housing Bank. Signifying the matters, Housing Bank recently 
        secured a commercial loan amounting to US$265 million as part of its 
        efforts to contain the problem. <br>
        <br>
        The fifth challenge relates to limited public sector spending. 
        Candidates argue that expanded oil receipt allows the authorities to 
        spend more rather than less. In fiscal 2005, the budget recorded a 
        surplus of US$680 million, thereby reversing planned deficit of US$778 
        million. Yet, this surplus was achieved partly due to the government 
        decision not to spend money allocated for capital projects. The 
        authorities consumed 53 per cent of allocated budget for capital 
        spending. Thus, candidates are urging the government to spend more in 
        the light of firm oil prices. <br>
        <br>
        Last but not least, there is the issue of increasing significance of oil 
        in the treasury income. Oil accounted for 76 per cent of total revenues 
        of 2005, up from 73 per cent in 2004 due to firmer oil prices in 
        international markets. Increasing reliance on oil runs contrary to the 
        government’s goal of diversifying the economy away from the hydrocarbons 
        sector. Like elsewhere, improving the wellbeing of people is the main 
        topic in Bahrain’s elections for candidates and voters alike.</font></p>

        <b>Record budget surplus on cards</b><br>
        For the current fiscal (FY06/07), Kuwait is expected to post a record 
        budget surplus between US$18.66 billion to 25.92 billion, according to 
        an economic report prepared by National Bank of Kuwait (NBK). Revenue 
        estimates and a rise in oil prices contributed to Kuwait’s largest ever 
        budget surplus — US$23.85 billion for the last fiscal year (2005-06), 
        said the report.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="pic79.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="225" height="170">According 
        to the NBK report, the surplus for fiscal 2005-2006 was “the largest on 
        record and equivalent to 29 per cent of the 2005 gross domestic 
        product.” Recently released figures by the Ministry of Finance show 
        revenue growth increased to 53 per cent, and the fiscal surplus more 
        than doubling from a year ago. The surplus, at US$23.74 billion before 
        the mandatory allocation of 10 per cent of revenues to the Reserve Fund 
        for Future Generations (RFFG), was the largest on record.<br>
        <br>
        The surplus does not include investment income, which is not officially 
        reported by the government and is treated as an off-budget item. 
        According to balance of payments statistics, investment income from 
        abroad, which primarily accrues to the State’s foreign assets managed by 
        the Kuwait Investment Authority, was estimated at US$6.53 billion in 
        2005.<br>
        <br>
        The NBK report indicates that the government revenues reached US$47.46 
        billion on sharply higher oil revenues, which shot up to more than three 
        times budget projections and 59 per cent above the previous year’s 
        figure. Behind the rise in oil revenues was a 46 per cent increase in 
        the price of Kuwait crude, which averaged US$51 per barrel during the 
        fiscal year compared to US$35 the previous year.<br>
        <br>
        In contrast, non-oil revenues declined by 2.4 per cent on their previous 
        year level to US$2672 million, with their share of total revenues 
        falling to 5.6 per cent, less than half what it was only two years ago. 
        According to the report, total expenditures stood at US$23.71 billion in 
        2005-06, 9 per cent higher than the previous year. The biggest boost to 
        spending growth came from higher fuel costs incurred by the Ministry of 
        Energy for power generation. Fuel costs rose by 24 per cent representing 
        66 per cent of spending. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Profits boost in Q2</b><br>
        After a poor show in the first quarter, Kuwaiti companies recovered 
        during the second quarter to record the consolidated profits of US$3954 
        million in the first half of 2006. Second quarter profits of US$2504 
        million were up 5.9 per cent compared to the same period last year and 
        as much as 82 per cent higher than poor results in the first quarter. In 
        Q1 2006, as many as 26 companies reported losses, totaling US$591.1 
        million.<br>
        <br>
        According to NBK report, Q2 06 results were mixed with the industrial, 
        banking, and services sectors seeing their earnings grow by 30 per cent, 
        29 per cent and 21 per cent respectively, while the other sectors 
        witnessed declines in earnings. While the banking sector showed 
        consistently stable earnings growth over time, the investment sector was 
        particularly unstable. The most severe volatility in earnings growth 
        took place in Q4 05 and Q1 06 when earnings first increased 
        significantly before seeing a large drop. Furthermore, the earnings of 
        the banking sector appear to be largely uncorrelated with the rest of 
        the market, avoiding the ups and downs witnessed by other sectors, says 
        the report.<br>
        <br>
        The results show that the increases in earnings of the industrial and 
        services sectors can be attributed to only two companies, National 
        Industries Group Holding and Mobile Telecommunications Co. The banking 
        sector was the only one to see broad-based growth in earnings, with all 
        listed banks achieving positive growth in net profit, says the report.<br>
        Of the reporting companies, 71 saw an increase in their Q2 06 earnings 
        compared to a year before with their consolidated figure up by 47 per 
        cent. These companies’ consolidated earnings, which reached US$2256 
        million, represented 90 per cent of the total. Another 51 companies’ 
        profits drop by US$384.4 million, while 21 incurred losses totaling 
        US$60.15 million. These losses were well below losses suffered during Q1 
        06.</font></p>

        <b>Education gets lion’s share</b><br>
        The UAE Cabinet gave education the top priority in its federal budget 
        for the year 2007. It allocated US$1.9 billion, almost 25 per cent of 
        the total budget expenditure for education. Social sector also got 
        attention in the budget and will get 7.1 per cent of the total size of 
        the budget which is in excess of US$386 million, while the health sector 
        will get 7.2 per cent budgetary allocations (US$394 million). After 
        education, it is Security and Justice that got the second highest 
        budgetary allocations of 15.7 per cent, amounting to US$916 million.<br>
        <br>
        The Cabinet approved for the third consecutive year, a zero-deficit 
        federal budget for the fiscal 2007, with a record outlay of US$7.73 
        billion.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="pic81.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" width="125" height="136">“This 
        is the third consecutive year when the nation has achieved a balanced 
        budget, without any deficit between our revenues and expenditure... it 
        is also our budgetary philosophy to make efficient use of budget 
        allocations by introducing the concept of performance budgeting,” Dr. 
        Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash, State Minister for Financial and 
        Industrial Affairs, said while briefing the media after the cabinet 
        meeting. Recent UAE census results have shown that only 9.9 per cent of 
        the UAE nationals have secured university degrees. That only one per 
        cent of them reached postgraduate level cannot certainly be ignored. The 
        budget clearly indicates that the government is serious about the 
        education standards of nationals. While the Ministry of Education has 
        been allocated US$3.672 million (Dh13.5 million), US$83.44 million 
        (Dh306.8 million) has been earmarked for the projects. Thus the total 
        budget of the ministry comes to US$1423.9 million (Dh5,235.1 million), 
        constituting 25 per cent of the budget. The support for higher and 
        university education has been enhanced by adding US$34.13 million 
        (Dh125.5 million).<br>
        <br>
        Other top priority areas include development of infrastructure that got 
        US$407.1 million (Dh1.497 billion), about 7 per cent of the budgetary 
        provisions. US$118.26 million (Dh434.8 million) has been provided for 
        the road development projects, including the Dubai-Fujairah Express Way.<br>
        <br>
        The government will also introduce 10 new development programmes for 
        which US$306 million — 5.2 per cent of the resources — has been 
        earmarked. US$114.15 million have been provided for supporting the 
        social sector development projects, including primary schools, 
        co-education schools and kindergartens as well as for setting up of 
        hospitals, health clinics, dentistry and preventive medicine centres in 
        the different emirates.</font></p>

        <b>Insurance sector opens up</b><br>
        Ending the monopoly of the National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI), 
        the Saudi Cabinet issued license to 13 new insurance companies in 
        October as part of its move to open up its market after joining the 
        World Trade Organization. These insurance companies are: Gulf Union 
        Cooperative Insurance, Arabian Shield Insurance, Sanad for Cooperative 
        Insurance, Saudi United Cooperative Insurance (Amity), Assurance Saudi 
        Fransi, Al-Ahlia Insurance, Mediterranean &amp; Gulf Insurance &amp; Reinsurance 
        (MedGulf), Malath Insurance, Saudi Indian Insurance, Saudi IAIC for 
        Insurance, Allied Cooperative Insurance Group, SABB Takaful and Saudi 
        Arabian Insurance.<br>
        <br>
        Most of the new businesses are joint ventures with foreign insurance 
        companies and they have to retain 30 per cent of income in the Kingdom 
        to cover payouts. The 13 companies will have a total capital of US$698 
        million and they will float shares worth US$249.7 million for public 
        subscription. The capital of the companies ranges between US$26.6 
        million and US$213.3 million. One of the companies has agreed to float 
        47.49 per cent of its shares, nine others will float 40 per cent, and 
        the remaining three between 25 and 31 per cent of the shares.<br>
        <br>
        The activities of the newly formed insurance companies are regulated by 
        Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Industry experts believe this move will 
        not only create thousands of jobs but also draw billions of dollars of 
        foreign investment into the Kingdom.<br>
        <br>
        Hamad Al-Sayari, Governor of SAMA, said the decision to license the 13 
        new companies had involved considerable effort, including the 
        preparation of a new law to monitor insurance firms. “Following the 
        drafting of the law, SAMA has taken steps to organise the market, 
        protect the rights of investors and ensure fair competition among the 
        firms,” he added.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Slow, but steady growth</b><br>
        The profitability growth of the Saudi listed corporate sector continues, 
        but at a relatively slower pace. The first-half results of the 78 out of 
        the 81 listed companies recorded 29.6 per cent growth, compared to the 
        44 per cent growth seen in the entire 2005 reported in a semi-annual 
        economic and financial publication recently released by the National 
        Commercial Bank (NCB). If the current earnings growth momentum were 
        extended over to the entire 2006, the combined net-profits of all the 
        listed companies should reach close to US$22.6 billion compared to 
        US$17.44 billion achieved in 2005. This will be the slowest earnings 
        growth since 2002 whereby the market recorded yearly average 
        profitability growth of nearly 50 per cent in the three years to 2005. 
        The slow growth is largely attributed to the 11 per cent drop in SABIC 
        earnings in the first half of this year, the report said.</font></p>

		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
        However, in the medium-term through 2008, the overall market average 
        profitability growth may not slip below the current levels as several 
        listed companies will start reaping the benefits of the ongoing capacity 
        expansions, says the report.<br>
        <br>
        The pattern of earnings growth across eight sectors of the equity market 
        reveals some interesting trends. The banking sector has contributed 
        significantly to the profits. Ten listed banks, which recorded 63.5 per 
        cent profitability growth in the first-half of 2006, have contributed 
        nearly 43 per cent of the combined net-profit of the 78 companies. 
        However, the notable point is the banks’ profitability appears to be 
        slowing down on sequential basis, from first quarter to the second 
        quarter. The listed banks’ profitability grew only by 3.3 per cent to 
        US$2.24 billion in the April-June quarter, from US$2.17 billion in the 
        January-March quarter, as some of the major sources of profitability 
        growth have dried up to some extent during the second quarter of this 
        year. <br>
        <br>
        The combined net profit of the 28 industrial sector companies 
        overwhelmed by SABIC, declined by 3.6 per cent to US$3.01 billion in the 
        first-half of 2006, which is still better than the 7.7 per cent decline 
        seen in the first quarter of this year. Excluding SABIC, which posted 11 
        per cent lower profit, the combined net-profit of the remaining 27 
        industrial companies in fact rose by 24.4 per cent to US$677 million in 
        the first six months of 2006, from US$501 million in the same period a 
        year ago. <br>
        <br>
        The telecommunications sector, which consists of Saudi Telecom Company (STC) 
        and Etihad Etisalat (Mobily), contributed about 18 per cent of the 
        market total for the first-half with STC accounting for nearly 98 per 
        cent of the sector total. In the first half of 2006, Etihad Etisalat (Mobily) 
        has become profitable, reporting 36.1 per cent growth in its combined 
        profit to US$1.85 billion. The eight cement companies reported nearly 
        28.3 per cent growth in their combined net-profit for the first six 
        months of this year while the pace of growth in their profits were slow 
        at 13.7 per cent during the April-June quarter.</font></p>

        Al-Jazeera lands into fresh controversy<br>
        </b><br>
        <img border="0" src="pic85.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="200" height="135">Tunisia 
        has shut down its embassy in Doha. This is done in protest by Tunisia at 
        what it called a hostile campaign by Al-Jazeera after it aired an 
        interview with Moncef Marzouki, an opponent of the Tunisian government, 
        in which he called for civil resistance. The popular channel had earlier 
        broadcast a programme focusing on the Tunisian government’s campaign 
        against the hijab, the scarf worn by some Muslim women, which it brands 
        as sectarian dress.<br>
        <br>
        Al-Jazeera’s director general, Waddah Khanfar, said that the satellite 
        channel does not express Qatar’s policies. “We receive financial support 
        from the Qatari government, but it keeps its distance from the channel’s 
        editorial policies,” Khanfar said. He added that while Qatari Foreign 
        Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani had voiced 
        reservations about some of Al-Jazeera’s programmes but this did not lead 
        to official Qatari intervention in our editorial policy. Although the 
        Qatari chief diplomat once admitted that Al-Jazeera was a constant 
        source of headaches for Doha, the Qatari officials have consistently 
        tried to draw a line between themselves and the news channel, which has 
        irked many governments in the Arab world and beyond since it was 
        launched a decade ago.<br>

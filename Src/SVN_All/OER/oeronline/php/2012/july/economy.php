						historic potential as a regional hub has never been more 
						achievable<br>
						<br>
						By Oliver Cornock</font></b><br>
						&nbsp;<p align="justify" class="style13">
						In addition to its sizeable reserves of oil and gas, 
						Oman enjoys another geographical advantage. It is 
						central to the region, and its position at the mouth of 
						the Persian Gulf makes it an obvious location for the 
						trans-shipment of goods. As the Sultanate looks to 
						reduce its dependence on hydrocarbons, a wealth of 
						ambitious road, rail and air projects is now in the 
						pipeline to develop the country’s huge potential as a 
						‘gateway’ to the region.<br>
						<br>
						In April, Oman United Engineering Services (OUES) and 
						Portugal’s Sociedade de Construções Soares da Costa – 
						who are ranked among the world’s 100 biggest contractors 
						– won a contract to build road infrastructure linking 
						the new Muscat International Airport with the Muscat 
						Expressway. Valued at around $62m, the Omani-Portuguese 
						partnership saw off several contenders for the bid.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Focus on infrastructure <br>
						</b>This is the result of increasing infrastructure 
						prioritisation within Oman, which means that realising 
						the Sultanate’s historic potential as a regional hub has 
						never been more achievable. The latest five-year plan 
						(2011-2015) allocates some $78bn toward infrastructure 
						spending, representing a 113 per cent increase on the 
						last five-year plan. This government investment is 
						planned for a range of large-scale projects, including 
						over $25bn on building construction, $15bn investment in 
						Salalah Free Zone, investment of $1bn on developing a 
						medical city (also in Salalah).<br>
						<br>
						Last year, a report by Business Monitor International 
						described Oman’s construction and infrastructure sectors 
						as “fragile”, citing the Oman Cement Company’s 77 per 
						cent drop in 4Q profits for 2010 as evidence of a weak 
						sector, which would struggle to recover. Yet, less than 
						a year later, the situation has been transformed. If 
						Omani infrastructure was ever considered “weak” in the 
						past, it must surely now be recognised as one of the 
						most promising sectors going forward.<br>
						<br>
						The results of the marked rise in sector spending speak 
						for themselves; since the implementation of the latest 
						Five-Year Plan, the non-hydrocarbon sector has exhibited 
						rapid increases in their GDP contributions, including 
						manufacturing (with 17.5 per cent growth), electricity 
						and water (9.5 per cent) and construction (5.8 per 
						cent).<br>
						<br>
						<b>Diversifying economy<br>
						</b>Of course, oil and gas continue to play a 
						significant role in Oman’s economic performance, 
						contributing just under half of GDP in 2011. Indeed, the 
						government is continuing with its plans to diversify, 
						modernise and “Omanise” the economy to the extent that 
						oil will only contribute 9 per cent of GDP by 2020, 
						according to Vision 2020, Oman’s diversification policy. 
						As part of these plans, infrastructure upgrades play a 
						key part in supporting non-hydrocarbon growth.<br>
						<br>
						Specifically, it’s the transport sector that is set to 
						be the big winner from this increased funding. The 
						current Five-Year Plan sets aside around $20bn for 
						transport infrastructure projects up to 2015. This 
						includes a new terminal at Muscat International Airport, 
						which will be completed by 2014, with the capacity to 
						handle 12mn passengers annually. Furthermore, Oman’s 
						connection with the inter-GCC railway network will be a 
						significant development, bringing enhanced freight and 
						passenger access to the entire region.<br>
						<br>
						The government’s strategy is to provide a solid platform 
						for economic diversification. Infrastructure upgrades 
						will create a positive cycle of improved connectivity 
						and transport linkages, which in turn will make Oman 
						more attractive to business and foreign investment.<br>
						<br>
						The positive spin-offs that investment in infrastructure 
						will bring to the Sultanate’s diversification drive are 
						clear. The expansion of the airport and passenger 
						handling capacity, for example, will support growth 
						plans for Oman’s travel and tourism industry, which 
						Vision 2020 forecasts will contribute 6 per cent of the 
						country’s total GDP by 2021. Additionally, although 
						specific details have not yet been announced, Oman 
						intends to build or expand six airports, including 
						Salalah airport. To further facilitate the growth of 
						tourism, the government has already approved the 
						spending of around $8bn on tourism-related property 
						developments across the country, with the aim to attract 
						around 12 million visitors a year by 2020.<br>
						<br>
						With regard to overland transport, Oman’s challenging 
						topography has traditionally posed difficulties with the 
						development of transport links in Oman’s interior, yet 
						the increase in funding, together with technological 
						improvements mean that long-awaited projects can at last 
						go ahead. Indeed, the idea of a GCC-wide railway has 
						been talked about since 1981, but the region is closer 
						than ever to achieving this. According to the Ministry 
						of Transport and Communications, when operational the 
						Oman-GCC railway will be 2000 km long (with 1000 km of 
						track in Oman), running from Kuwait’s border with Iraq, 
						down to Salalah in the southern tip of Oman. The 
						expected total cost of the regional project is estimated 
						at $25bn.<br>
						<br>
						This will allow Oman to tap into regional trade (and 
						vice-versa), stimulating commerce by facilitating the 
						movement of goods. The Port of Salalah, for example, is 
						strategically located on the major shipping lanes 
						between Europe and East Asia, and greater access by rail 
						will increase its competitiveness with other Gulf ports. 
						Given that the difference between docking at Salalah and 
						Dubai is three days’ journey, Salalah has a huge amount 
						to gain from enhanced rail linkages.<br>
						<br>
						The projects are bold and ambitious, but the Omani 
						government is in no way passive or complacent about 
						drawing in foreign developers; rather, with construction 
						projects picking up momentum, Oman is actively courting 
						international participation. In April, Malaysia’s 
						minister for International Trade and Industry was 
						welcomed to Oman as part of a broader invitation to 
						Malaysian companies to take part in infrastructure deals 
						in the Sultanate. Although to date no Malaysian firms 
						have ventured into Oman, companies are now showing 
						interest in the Sultanate’s construction, retail and IT 
						sectors, as well as the halal meat segment.<br>
						<br>
						Furthermore, October will see Oman host an international 
						exhibition for infrastructure and industrial projects – 
						“InfraOman” – for the second time. Last year’s InfraOman 
						expo, the first of its kind to be held in Oman and the 
						GCC region, was attended by a host of international 
						firms, generating a great deal of interest in Omani 
						construction projects spread across a range of sectors, 
						including power, water and renewable energy technology. 
						Whereas last year the attention was mainly on heavy 
						industry and equipment, InfraOman 2012 will also have a 
						special focus on affordable housing, interior design and 
						building materials, areas which the Sultanate wants to 
						focus on in order to improve housing availability and 
						quality.<br>
						<br>
						Taking into account Oman’s geographical advantages, and 
						renewed spending drive on transport connectivity and 
						network upgrades, infrastructure investments in the 
						Sultanate are set to become increasingly attractive to 
						foreign investors. Oman’s huge potential as a gateway to 
						the region is set to become a reality.&#8194;</td>

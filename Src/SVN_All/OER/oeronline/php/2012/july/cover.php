				economies ranks Oman below the GCC average. OER speaks to a 
				cross section of industry leaders to delve into the obstacles

				In an “EESE” (enabling environment for sustainable enterprises) 
				Assessment for the Sultanate of Oman, the International Labour 
				Office (ILO) has found that 70 per cent of firms believe that 
				Oman’s regulatory environment makes it difficult for small 
				businesses to compete with large businesses. This discovery was 
				made during a survey conducted by the ILO among 150 respondents 
				from a cross section of the industry including company owners, 
				CEOs, directors and general managers of private sector firms.<br>
				<br>
				The survey focused on policy areas such as entrepreneurship; 
				culture; competition; enabling legal and regulatory environment; 
				good governance; information and communications technology; 
				education, training and lifelong learning/skills and education; 
				adequate social dialogue/social protection and work force 
				relations. One of the important themes which also emerged in 
				this ILO survey is that young Omanis do not start a business 
				precisely because of the difficulty in doing business in Oman. 
				So clearly there are a number of issues and challenges being 
				faced by businesses in the country. <br>
				<br>
				One of the most obvious challenges is the lack of clear 
				information. For example, most Omani investors or entrepreneurs 
				are not aware of the classification of what could constitute a 
				small business. No doubt, statistics are available in the 
				Directorate General of SME Development about Small and Medium 
				Enterprises (SMEs). For the record’s sake, there are around 
				121,000 SMEs operating in Oman constituting more than 90 per 
				cent of the economic activity and around 20 per cent of the GDP. 
				Mainly, the projects of these enterprises are in the wholesale, 
				retail and foodstuffs sectors which represent 41 per cent of the 
				total projects, while the industrial and contracting projects 
				represent 17 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<br>
				<br>
				“From a policy perspective, while the importance of private 
				sector development and entrepreneurship (read SME development) 
				are acknowledged in the eighth five-year plan (2011-2015), there 
				is no separate policy framework drawn up for promoting 
				entrepreneurship culture or SMEs in Oman. Action on this should 
				be a priority,” says the ILO in its EESE Assessment.<br>
				<br>
				The same sentiment has been echoed by a well known consultancy 
				firm which prepared an executive summary for the directorate 
				general for the development of small and medium enterprises, 
				Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI). The report summarises 
				that there is a lack of an SME policy framework and national 
				strategy which is coupled with the fact that the existing policy 
				framework is not conducive to SMEs. Due to this, there is 
				minimal coordination and alignment of SME programmes leading to 
				a stunted growth of this vital cog of the economy.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ground realities</b><br>
				According to Qais Al Khonji, director, Al Khonji Group, SMEs are 
				the backbone of any economy and contribute a lion’s share of the 
				revenues generated, but in Oman there are quite a few obstacles 
				which are hampering SMEs from performing at an optimal level. 
				And even though the government has been trying its level best to 
				minimise the obstacles and help SMEs to flourish, Qais believes 
				that more can be done.<br>
				<br>
				Qais points out one challenge which SMEs in general face is 
				marketing of new products. Any SME company which starts 
				operations needs help in creating awareness about its products 
				or services. But this is not easy especially in a market like 
				Oman.<br>
				<br>
				“Marketing is the biggest challenge that any small businesses 
				face and we require more marketing support for a better kick 
				off,” says Qais. And this support can come from any quarter. It 
				could be as simple as family and friends promoting your product. 
				For example, friends and family members could buy an SME product 
				or make use of a service and spread the news around through the 
				word of mouth.<br>
				<br>
				The other notable obstacle and a macro-economic factor which 
				works against SME growth and development is the prevailing 
				market conditions in the Sultanate, underlines Qais. Since Oman 
				is a very small market it is a tough challenge to garner the 
				requisite numbers in terms of buyers. Further, most Omani people 
				are more inclined towards saving money and spend only where 
				necessary. In such a situation, buying luxury products or 
				services is very minimal. So it is really tough for upcoming 
				SMEs or fledgling companies to penetrate the market without 
				hand-holding by the government or any other competent body.<br>
				<br>
				Hassan Mohammed Juma, managing director and founder of Mohammed 
				Juma Sultan Co, says when you begin a business many people look 
				at you with skepticism and little respect. Today the situation 
				may be better but seven years ago, the concept of 
				entrepreneurship was not flourishing. Being an entrepreneur at 
				that time meant that you could catch hold of an expatriate and 
				give him your license and take RO500 from him as returns at the 
				end of every month. That was how you ran a business, says 
				Hassan.<p align="center" class="style13" dir="ltr">

				<br>
				<b>Starting problems<br>
				</b>According to the ILO assessment, poorly designed regulations 
				and unnecessary bureaucratic burdens on business put limitations 
				on enterprise start-ups and can lead to informality. In some 
				areas, Oman has progressively improved the business environment 
				through greater liberalisation and measures aimed at reducing 
				regulatory burdens. It has primarily focused on reducing costs 
				and time required for starting a business and on simplifying tax 
				procedures.<br>
				<br>
				But it seems these measures are not enough. “There are many 
				challenges that face SMEs and one of the main challenges or 
				obstacles would be to start the business itself,” says Khaula 
				Hamoud Al Harthy, executive director, Lima Contracting and 
				Trading. Citing her own example, Khaula says, “If I were to take 
				myself as an example, although I have been working in our 
				company which is a small and medium enterprise (a family 
				business) and have been involved in it for the past 8 years, I 
				would still face many challenges if I had to start a new 
				business of my own. Some of those are lack of experience, 
				guidance from the right authorities, and lack of enough skilled 
				manpower in the chosen field of business. So most of the 
				challenges come up when you want to start a business.<br>
				<br>
				Adds Khaula, “Since many people don’t know how to start a 
				business, to compound the complications, we don’t have a 
				properly activated one-stop-shop which would help us to start a 
				business. I think there is a communication problem between the 
				citizen’s expectations and the government initiatives, which 
				unfortunately has discouraged a number of people from setting up 
				new businesses. I do believe that things would change for the 
				better in the coming future since the government has realised 
				the importance of SMEs and their impact on our national economy, 
				therefore their plan would be to support existing SMEs and 
				encourage new ones to come up.”<br>
&nbsp;<p align="center" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-12-3.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #808080;" class="style17" width="500" height="333"></font><p align="justify" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<br>
				<b>Regulatory lacunae<br>
				</b>Hassan says that that one of the big challenges for SMEs in 
				some cases is the non-compliance with the system, be it by the 
				people or the government staff. Everyone follows their own 
				judgments, creates hurdles for business. For example, a 
				government employee may be giving clearance for certain imported 
				products with his own understanding of the regulation. But the 
				next person who comes after him refuses to give a clearance for 
				the same product. We try to object but then we later realise 
				that the earlier person was actually at fault for not following 
				the system and using only his judgment.<br>
				<br>
				“Another obstacle is the lack of accountability among the 
				service providers, be it in the private sector or government. I 
				believe that all large service providers should have KPIs for 
				their employees. If an employee receives 100 applications for 
				processing per day, and if he or she complains of being 
				overloaded, then what is the benchmark for this overload? Are 
				you overloaded because last night you were watching a football 
				match and today morning you don’t feel like working or is there 
				any other reason?”, adds Hassan. <br>
				<br>
				The subject of Omanisation continues to be the pinprick and pet 
				grievance for most of the organisations, but another regulatory 
				problem boils down to understanding the requirements of a 
				business for the right manpower and in the required numbers. If 
				someone is running a B2B business, they can have a small 
				premises as a representative office and don’t need as much space 
				as that of a bank because most of the staff are out in the 
				market doing business. A number of times such an organisation is 
				refused to be given the required number of labour clearances 
				because it has a small premises. The regulators should 
				understand the nature of the business and how much staff they 
				require, Hassan adds.<br>
				<br>
				Basically, the whole SME sector is still in a nascent stage 
				although it is supposed to be the backbone of the economy. Both 
				the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) as well as MoCI 
				are involved in developing the SME sector, says Khaula who is a 
				member of the SME department of the OCCI which has just been 
				founded. “Right now we are working on some kind of a definition 
				for the SMEs which would help us to move forward. The 
				committee’s main goals are to help out SMEs in getting the 
				financial support, get the government to support the SMEs 
				through simplifying the process of setting up a business, to 
				raise awareness of the importance of SMEs within our society, 
				and to encourage the setting up of more SMEs,” Khaula adds.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Education and entrepreneurship<br>
				</b>One of the areas in which the government should focus their 
				energies is educating the youth of the country to become 
				entrepreneurs. This move, while seemingly aimed at the 
				grassroots will provide the much needed impetus for bringing 
				about a shift of culture from being ‘sleeping partners’ in 
				expatriate-driven SMEs to active contributors to the economy of 
				the country.<br>
				<br>
				Qais suggests that the government represented by both the 
				Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education has 
				to take an initiative to introduce entrepreneurship courses in 
				grades 11 and 12. He further feels that the ministry of higher 
				education should adopt a new concept of establishing an 
				entrepreneurship academy to foster and inculcate the values of 
				becoming an entrepreneur.<br>
				<br>
				Oman has a wide range of separate initiatives to provide 
				entrepreneurs with necessary skills and help them with 
				financing, yet these often seem supply-driven and lack cohesion, 
				says the ILO survey which suggests that there is a positive view 
				of entrepreneurship from young people (41 per cent sharing this 
				view). However, a large sample of enterprises surveyed (43 per 
				cent) believe that only a small minority of young people have 
				the right skills to successfully run a business. Education is 
				where the whole culture shift has to spring from.<br>
				<br>
				On this front, MoCI has taken a number of steps to stir up 
				entrepreneurial traits in Omani youth by promoting 
				entrepreneurial clubs in schools and colleges. Says Salah bin 
				Hilal Al Maawali, Director General, SME Department at MoCI, “we 
				have been working with many stakeholders concerned with SMEs to 
				develop a strategy for SME sector. Presently, the DG of SME 
				department, set up in 2007, has been providing training support 
				to the existing and potential entrepreneurs of SMEs through 
				structured programmes. The directorate-general conducted around 
				76 training programmes covering a wide range of topics including 
				marketing, finance and general management. Many entrepreneurs 
				and academicians participated in these training programmes.”<br>
				<br>
				In order to bring awareness about the support services available 
				for the SMEs, the directorate-general has prepared a compendium 
				called, “Directory of Services for SMEs in Oman”. This provides 
				detailed information of the various programmes and services 
				offered by different government and private sector agencies in 
				the Sultanate including the funding options available from the 
				major financial institutions.<p align="center" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-12-4.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #808080;" class="style17" width="500" height="333"></font><br>
&nbsp;<p align="justify" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<b>Government perspective<br>
				</b>From the government’s point of view, it has identified two 
				main obstacles for the growth of SMEs. The first obstacle is the 
				expatriate entrepreneurs who are running a large number of small 
				and medium enterprises. Salah has disclosed that in a study 
				conducted by the ministry, it has been found out that 60 per 
				cent of the 1.3 million expatriates in Oman are owners of 
				businesses under the sleeping partner tactic. These are the 
				people who don’t implement new technology or new systems and 
				don’t provide proper services or employment to local talent 
				since they are too expensive by way of salaries.<br>
				<br>
				On the other hand, you have Omani graduates from schools, 
				colleges and universities in the age bracket of 18-26, who would 
				like to start their own business. But they don’t have patience, 
				or an understanding of the nature of business, and they don’t 
				have the knowledge of technology and still want to make money as 
				fast as possible. In order to overcome these impediments, the 
				ministry through the DG of SME department, has created incentive 
				packages for Omanis to implement technology, train and give them 
				a better environment for starting their own businesses.<br>
				<br>
				“As part of our hand-holding gestures, we have several 
				initiatives like doing business from home, loan bank guarantee, 
				a PEIE business centre and a business diagnostic centre to help 
				entrepreneurs start their own ventures. This diagnostic centre 
				will help them to identify the business, develop the business 
				plan and identify the right kind of financing,” Salah says.<br>
				<br>
				The scheme for starting a business from home is the simplest and 
				most effective, Salah discloses. Anyone who wants to start a 
				business can register themselves with MoCI by paying three rials 
				for three years and begin their business. After three years, the 
				SME is required to do a formal registration with the OCCI as 
				well the MOCI. It cannot get any better or simpler than this, 
				says Salah.<br>
				<br>
				The ministry is also working closely with the Tender Board for a 
				mechanism to give benefits to SMEs through Article 36 which 
				mentions that Omani products have to be taken even if they are 
				priced at 10 per cent higher rate. This way local products, 
				goods and services will be given preference and revenues 
				generated for the smaller companies.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from manufacturing sector, the services sector has been 
				identified as one of the key thrust areas in which SME 
				development will be encouraged by MOCI.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Work stoppages</b><br>
				Talking about difficulties facing businesses in Oman, large 
				companies in manufacturing and the oil and gas sector have been 
				facing real time problems like labour unrest, high turnover of 
				employees etc. There have been instances of work stoppages in 
				various companies in Sohar and Muscat recently. If such problems 
				continue then the ramifications would be very bad as new 
				investments will be impacted and old investors will try and 
				withdraw. There is a loss of productivity and this has to be 
				made up by other workers. <br>
&nbsp;<p align="center" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-12-5.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #808080;" class="style17" width="500" height="333"></font><p align="justify" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<br>
				Dr Bhaskar Dutta, CEO, Jazeera Steel Products Company, says, the 
				problem is that people only want benefits, bonus, increments etc 
				and they are not interested in work. Almost every company in 
				Sohar is facing similar issues. Absenteeism is galore. During 
				the recent three day holidays of Al Isra’ wal Miraj (June 14 to 
				16), 40 people were absent a day before the holidays and 
				probably another 40 were absent a day after the holidays. They 
				come back and fill up an emergency or sick leave application.<br>
				<br>
				Further, there are no procedures that are being followed, either 
				by the workers or the junior officials in the Ministry of 
				Manpower (MoM) for solving matters. “If some workers go and make 
				a random compliant to the MoM, then the junior officials of the 
				MoM start harassing us based on those complaints. We have 
				certain grievance procedures in our company and if people are 
				not happy, they have to follow this process, but this is not 
				happening. When we raise constructive issues like work culture, 
				tackling absenteeism the MoM officials brush them aside saying 
				that in such instances you need to follow the law. With this 
				indulgence, the workers think that they can do whatever they 
				want,” says Dutta.</td>

				wins prestigious Forbes Award</b><br>
				Abdulaziz al Balushi, CEO of ahlibank has been conferred the 
				coveted Forbes award for “the Second Best CEO in the Arab 
				World”. Receiving the prestigious recognition in the Forbes 
				Award Ceremony for Top CEOs at Atlantis, The Palm Hotel &amp; Resort 
				Dubai, Al Balushi said, “This is a proud moment for me 
				personally as a professional banker and more importantly, all of 
				us at ahlibank. As the CEO, it is a wonderful feeling to receive 
				this prestigious award from Forbes”. Abdulaziz was felicitated 
				by Forbes Middle East for demonstrating great performance, 
				strong vision and teamwork as the leader and CEO of ahlibank.<br>
				<br>
				A total of 324 companies were anaylsed by Forbes magazine and Al 
				Balushi was selected as the second best CEO from a list of 75 
				bank CEOs in the Arab World.<br>
				<br>
				Al Balushi added “ I dedicate this recognition to all our 
				ahlibankers who made this possible. As CEO, my job was to select 
				the right people for the right job and support them in achieving 
				their goals. We have invested in our people, products and 
				technology. The results of these investments and our hardwork is 
				reflected in our consistant performance for the last 5 years. 
				Let me also take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders 
				– customers, shareholders, employees, regulators, board members 
				and more particularly, our strategic partner, Ahli United Bank, 
				for their support and guidance all along.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Fund for development of SMEs<br>
				</b>The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has set up a new Small 
				and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Development Fund with an initial 
				capital of RO100mn. This initiative is primarily targeted at 
				Omani school and college students with the aim of inculcating in 
				them an entrepreneurial spirit and encouraging them to pursue 
				self-employment opportunities.<br>
				<br>
				Raphael Parambi, CEO of National Company for Projects and 
				Management (NCPM), which is expected to administer the fund, 
				said the project would have hugely beneficial implications for 
				the government’s SME development objectives.<br>
				<br>
				The Fund’s seed capital of RO100mn is drawn from investments by 
				private sector pension funds, financial institutions and a 
				couple of large business groups.<br>
				<br>
				Over the next 10 years, over 500,000 students will be trained 
				and encouraged to start SMEs by training, nurturing, monitoring 
				and legitimising services. The project has the potential to 
				generate thousands of small and medium enterprises, as well as 
				contribute around RO1bn in value addition to the economy.<p align="justify" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				This fund is expected to create around 7,500 successful 
				entrepreneurs and contribute 50,000 jobs. Taking an average 
				value addition of RO8,000 per month, the fund’s contribution to 
				the economy is expected to be RO1bn of value addition.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Second Islamic bank launched<br>
				</b>Alizz bank is the Sultanate’s second islamic bank and was 
				launched this year. The bank is looking forward to hit the 
				ground running thanks to the buzz it has begun to generate. The 
				RO40mn IPO of the bank, which was opened in September, has 
				received a fair amount of attraction and will be listed this 
				month. The bank aims to capture a 20 per cent market share in 
				Oman’s Islamic banking sector over the next five years.<br>
				<br>
				The promoters have already contributed RO61.2mn, representing 60 
				per cent of bank’s share capital at 102bz per share. On 
				completion of the IPO, the bank will have a paid-up share 
				capital of RO100mn. Alizz bank is promoted by Huriah Company, an 
				investment vehicle owned by HH Sayyid As’ad bin Tarik al Said, 
				UAE-based Aabar Investments, Tasameem Real Estate Company and 
				First Energy Oman, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
				Bahrain-based First Energy Bank. Ahmed al Khonji, speaking on 
				behalf of Huriah Company, said, “The large unmet demand for 
				Islamic banking means that alizz is uniquely placed to become a 
				market leader for banking products.<br>
				<br>
				“We are delighted to have Aabar, First Energy and Tasameem as 
				our partners and the bank will benefit immensely from their 
				considerable international experience.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Role model for entrepreneurs<br>
				</b>Dr Mohammed al Barwani, chairman of MB Holding Company was 
				named Ernst and Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year. This is the 
				first time the awards have been held in Oman marking the 25th 
				anniversary of the E&amp;Y awards worldwide. The winners were 
				selected by an independent panel of judges. The criteria on 
				which the selection was based was entrepreneurial spirit, 
				financial performance, service to the local community and 
				international arena as well as personal integrity and influence.<br>
				<br>
				Barwani, left his job with Petroleum Development Oman, 30 years 
				ago, to set up his own company, the MB Holding Group. Today the 
				group has 6,000 employees with operations in more than 20 
				countries. The MB Group chairman added that a good education is 
				required for the next generation of Oman’s entrepreneurs to 
				succeed, especially as the private sector is gaining importance 
				as a provider of jobs and generator of economic activity.<br>
				<br>
				Barwani said, “I am honoured to win such a prestigious award, 
				and look forward to representing the Sultanate in the global 
				competition. It will be fascinating to meet and interact with 
				fellow entrepreneurs from all over the world.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Oman’s influential banker<br>
				</b>AbdulRazak Ali Issa, chief executive of bank muscat, was 
				ranked in ‘Power 500 – the world’s most influential Arabs’ 
				listing by Arabian Business magazine for the second consecutive 
				year. He has earned this prominent position among the 500 
				world’s most influential Arabs in recognition of outstanding 
				contributions to the banking and financial sector in Oman and 
				the GCC region.<br>
				<br>
				In recognition of outstanding contributions to the banking 
				sector in Oman and the Arab region, AbdulRazak was also honoured 
				as the Arab Banking Personality of 2012 by Arab Banking Union 
				during the two-day International Arab Banking Summit 2012 in 
				Berlin, Germany.<br>
				<br>
				AbdulRazak, who has over 35 years of experience in the banking 
				sector, assumed the role of chief executive of BankMuscat in 
				1994. A highly respected figure in the financial sector, 
				AbdulRazak continues to lead BankMuscat from strength to 
				strength as the flagship financial institution in the Sultanate.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Shouldering responsibilities with aplomb<br>
				</b>HE Yahya bin Said al Jabri has been appointed chairman of 
				the Capital Market Authority (CMA) in addition to being the 
				chairman of the Duqm Special Economic Zone Authority with the 
				rank of a minister. HE Jabri, who was formerly executive 
				president of CMA, replaces HE Eng Ali bin Masoud bin Ali al 
				Sunaidy, Minister of Commerce and Industry, as chief of the 
				stock market watchdog.<br>
				<br>
				HE Jabri has vast experience of global corporate and investment 
				banking with academic qualifications from prestigious American 
				schools including the Kellogg School of Management, Harvard 
				Business School and Darden University wherein he attained 
				degrees in advanced management programmes. <br>
				<br>
				Apart from his current positions, he also holds senior positions 
				in Oman’s leading business and financial sectors such as a 
				member of the board of directors at the Central Bank of Oman, a 
				board member of the Civil Service Pension Fund, chairman of Pak 
				Oman Investment Company and chairman of Majan Electricity 
				Company to name a few.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Air service to boost Duqm development<br>
				</b>National carrier Oman Air started a direct charter service 
				between Muscat and Jaaluni airport (near Duqm) in Al Wusta 
				governorate. The three flights a week on charter basis for the 
				Special Economic Zone Authority in Duqm, will help the 
				authorities to cut short a six-hour journey by road from Muscat 
				to one-and-a-half hours for their corporate clients, including 
				potential investors.<br>
				<br>
				This air link will assist citizens, businessmen and investors to 
				save up to five hours of travel time. Currently, it takes about 
				six hours to reach Jaaluni from Muscat by road while the flight 
				between Muscat and Jaaluni takes approximately one hour and 
				thirty minutes. Also, the current frequency of three flights a 
				week to Jaaluni airport is adequate for the time being.<br>
				<br>
				The air operations between Muscat and Jaaluni are part of the 
				series of successful initiatives that are aimed at promoting and 
				developing the infrastructure in the region. This will be 
				followed by similar steps that will accelerate the completion of 
				the infrastructural development of the Special Economic Zone of 
				Duqm, as well as the rest of the Wilayats of Al Wusta 
				governorate, not to mention the indirect impact of these 
				initiatives on the various sectors of tourism, investment and 
				industry, besides the direct positive effect on the lives of 
				citizens of the Al Wusta governorate, as well as individuals, 
				whose work and interests are associated with the governorate.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Contributing to Oman and India<br>
				</b>Kiran Asher, founder partner and group managing director of 
				Al Ansari Group of Companies, has been conferred the Pravasi 
				Bharatiya Samman award for his outstanding contribution in 
				enhancing India’s image in the Sultanate of Oman. Pravasi 
				Bharatiya Samman is the highest award conferred by the Indian 
				government on NRIs and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and 
				institutions run by them. They are recognised for their 
				contribution in serving the Indian Diaspora and enhancing 
				India’s image in different parts of the world.<br>
				<br>
				Asher was among the 14 eminent overseas Indians who received the 
				award at the valedictory session of the 10th Pravasi Bharatiya 
				Divas in Jaipur at the hands of Indian President Pratibha Patil 
				Asher became the fifth individual from Oman to win the coveted 
				award. The previous winners from Oman include Kanaksi Gokaldas 
				Khimji (Khimji Ramdas) in 2003; P Mohammed Ali (Galfar) in 2004; 
				P N C Menon (The Sobha Group) in 2009; and Suresh K Virmani 
				(Bahwan Engineering Company) in 2010. Asher is the 
				founder-partner and group managing director of Al Ansari Group 
				of Companies, which was established in 1975 and has 11 companies 
				in Oman, the UAE and India.<br>
				<br>
				<b>In-country value keeps everything ‘inhouse’<br>
				</b>In-Country Value (ICV) is defined as the total spend 
				retained in country that benefits business development, 
				contributes to human capability development and stimulates 
				productivity in Oman’s economy. Towards this end, Petroleum 
				Development Oman (PDO) set itself some significant stakes in the 
				ground and began to spend in local service provision and local 
				manufacturing out of its total capital investment, which is in 
				excess of $4bn a year.<br>
				<br>
				Raoul M Restucci, managing director, PDO, says that as per the 
				company’s ICV proposition, the goal is to dramatically increase, 
				to approximately 50 per cent at its manufacturing requirements 
				and in excess of 75 per cent in services, up to 90 per cent in 
				some cases, across the entire oil and gas value chain by 2020.<br>
				<br>
				So in financial terms it equates to an annual increment of 
				$100mn in manufacturing and $100mn in services, all targeted for 
				local development. If we take the existing spend plus PDO’s 
				annual targets, local spend will exceed $3bn by 2020, adding 
				considerable value to the gross national product, on a direct 
				and indirect basis.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Investment in improvement of living standards<br>
				</b>Oman’s Haya Water is reportedly planning to invest up to 
				$2.6bn into Oman’s sewage system over the next six years. The 
				firm is looking at various schemes throughout the country that 
				will be implemented by 2018. <br>
				<br>
				Hussain Hassan Ali AbdulHussain, CEO, Haya Water stated that the 
				company had so far invested around $1.8bn in projects such as 
				sewage treatment plants and pipelines. Around 40,000 households 
				in Muscat are currently connected to its sewage network, and 
				there are plans to increase this to 200,000 homes or 80 per cent 
				of the city by 2018.<br>
				<br>
				Hussain reported that up to 12 projects are currently underway, 
				including sewage treatment plants in Seeb and Darsait. The 
				company has built 550km of the sewer network, and has plans to 
				increase this to over 4,000km.<br>
				<br>
				<b>National strategy on intellectual property<br>
				</b>The Sultanate of Oman is developing a National Strategy for 
				Innovation and Intellectual Property, specifically in the 
				educational arena, according to the Sultanate’s permanent 
				representative to the UN and International Organisations in 
				Geneva HE Abdullah Bin Nasser Al Rahbi. HE Rahbi said the 
				Sultanate welcomes support of developing countries to build 
				capacities to draft national strategies. Oman is seeking 
				cooperation from Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo) and 
				others to prepare a national strategy in training and building 
				capacities to develop the National Strategy for Innovation and 
				Intellectual Property in the Sultanate, especially in the 
				project to integrate concepts of innovation and intellectual 
				property in basic and general education curricula. It will have 
				a positive impact on the coming generations in a knowledge 
				economy-based environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>HSBC, OIB merger takes place<br>
				</b>HSBC Bank Oman, the entity which has been formed after the 
				merger of Oman International Bank and the Oman operations of 
				HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, began its operations from June. 
				In the combined entity, HSBC owns a 51 per cent stake.<br>
				<br>
				HSBC Bank Oman has one of the largest branch networks in the 
				country, serving the needs of retail, corporate and 
				institutional customers. HSBC Bank Oman will feature the HSBC 
				red hexagon logo and has begun refurbishing its branches, to 
				improve their look and feel as well as the overall banking 
				experience for customers. Trading on the Muscat Stock Market 
				takes place using the ticker ‘HBMO’.<br>
				<br>
				Simon Cooper, deputy chairman and CEO of HSBC Middle East &amp; 
				North Africa, has been appointed as chairman of HSBC Bank Oman’s 
				seven-member board of directors, with each director serving an 
				initial three-year term. Ewan Stirling has been appointed CEO of 
				the combined entity.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Truly sensational campaign<br>
				</b>Champion racing driver Ahmad al Harthy bagged the Porsche 
				Carrera Cup GB Pro-Am 1 winner’s trophy in November. Ahmad, who 
				memorably sealed the 2012 crown with one race meeting to spare 
				after a truly sensational campaign, produced a near faultless 
				season in Porsche Carrera Cup GB with an incredible tally of 
				wins and podiums. Taking 12 Pro-Am 1 victories and 17 podiums in 
				total from the championship’s 20 races, Ahmad truly was a star 
				performer season-long. “It’s nice to finally get my hands on the 
				big trophy, and what a fantastic trophy it is!,” said the 
				31-year-old. For Ahmad, his title success marked the first ever 
				for an Omani driver at such a high level of motor racing and he 
				also entered the history books as the first person of Arab 
				origin to win a championship in a series of Porsche Carrera Cup 
				GB’s stature. In addition to collecting his champion’s trophy, 
				Ahmad also received the keys to a stunning brand new Porsche 911 
				Carrera 2 roadcar.<br>

				<b>Rising stars of the corporate world<br>
				</b>Murtadha Al Lawati, head of corporate communications, 
				Ahlibank; Abbas Hassan Al Lawati, manager, equity group 
				investment banking, BankMuscat; and Sami Mohsin Al Sheikh, 
				general manager, human resources, Enhance, emerged winners of 
				the 2012 NTI BizPro Awards. NTI BizPro Awards are now recognised 
				as the benchmark for identifying talented young Omanis who have 
				excelled in the corporate world and carved a niche for 
				themselves by sheer dint of hard work, determination to succeed 
				and a strong will to raise the bar for their goals. BizPro 
				Awards 2012 got close to 100 nominations, out of which 10 
				candidates made it to the pre-final stage and five to the grand 
				final. The nominees were judged on skills, decision making 
				acumen, result orientation, presentation and communication 
				skills. The three winners were presented with a trophy and a 
				certificate in addition to a scholarship of RO2,500 from 
				Renaissance Services.<br>

				Triumphant leaders, sportsmen par excellence and disgraced 
				heroes – a look at the people who made the headlines this year
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Barack Obama<br>
				Winning a second term as the President of the US<br>
				</b>President Barack Obama was re-elected to a second term, 
				defeating Republican challenger Mitt Romney in November, 2012. 
				Obama secured 332 electoral votes far more than the 270 votes in 
				the electoral college needed to win. The president elect 
				prevailed despite lingering dissatisfaction with the economy and 
				a hard-fought challenge by Romney.<br>
				<br>
				In his victory speech before supporters in Chicago, Obama said 
				he was returning to the White House “more determined, and more 
				inspired than ever about the work there is to do, and the future 
				that lies ahead”. He pledged to work with Republican leaders in 
				Congress to reduce the government’s budget deficit, fix the tax 
				code and reform the immigration system. “We are an American 
				family and we rise and fall together as one nation,” he said.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Queen Elizabeth II<br>
				60th year of accession to the throne<br>
				</b>The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II marking the 60th 
				anniversary of her accession to the thrones of the United 
				Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the 60th 
				anniversary of her becoming Head of the Commonwealth was 
				celebrated across the world in June, 2012. The celebration was 
				marked throughout the year. A stirring flotilla of a thousand 
				boats on the river Thames, was the highlight of a four-day 
				special celebration to celebrate the monarch’s diamond jubilee. 
				The monarch, who is 86, and her husband, Prince Philip, 90 
				accepted the best wishes of people from the open deck of the 
				royal barge as it made its way down the seven-mile course of the 
				pageant, waving at crowds that shouted “God save the Queen” and 
				hoisted a forest of Union Jacks. With a TV audience of tens of 
				millions at home and abroad, commentators called it the greatest 
				public spectacle of the queen’s reign.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Mark Zuckerburg<br>
				Facebook IPO and a billion dollars<br>
				</b>Facebook Inc’s $16bn initial public offering (IPO) on May 
				18, 2012 made its 28-year-old founder Mark Zuckerberg the 29th 
				richest person on Earth. Facebook, the world’s most popular 
				social networking company, sold 421.2 million shares for $38 
				each. At that price, the 503.6 million shares and options that 
				Zuckerberg owns were valued at $19.1bn, making him wealthier 
				than Google Inc. co- founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, 
				according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.<br>
				Facebook’s CEO started the Menlo Park, California-based company 
				for Harvard University classmates as a 19-year-old in his dorm 
				room. It now has more than 900 million monthly users and 
				generated $3.7 bn in revenue in 2011. Zuckerberg sold 30.2 
				million shares for $1.15 billion during the offering.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Francois Hollande<br>
				France’s first left-wing President in 20 years<br>
				</b>François Hollande of the Socialist Party defeated Nicolas 
				Sarkozy in the French presidential elections held in May 2012 to 
				become the first leftwing president in almost 20 years. Hollande 
				is the first Socialist president to win a French election since 
				François Mitterrand’s re-election in 1988. Hours before the 
				official announcement, hordes of cheering supporters began 
				gathering at Paris’s Place de la Bastille, a flashpoint of the 
				1789 French revolution, where the left had celebrated 
				Mitterrand’s first historic victory in 1981.<br>
				<br>
				The right has held the French presidency since Jacques Chirac’s 
				victory in 1995. The defeat of the most unpopular French 
				president ever to run for re-election was not simply the result 
				of the global financial crisis or eurozone debt turmoil. It was 
				also down to the intense public dislike of the man viewed by 
				many as the “president of the rich” who had swept to victory in 
				2007 with a huge mandate to change France. The majority of 
				French people felt he had failed to deliver on his promises, and 
				was criticised for his ostentatious display of wealth, favouring 
				the rich and leaving behind over 2.8 million unemployed. 
				Political analysts said anti-Sarkozy sentiment had become a 
				cultural phenomenon in France.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Rupert Murdoch<br>
				Shuts down News of the World<br>
				</b>Media mogul Rupert Murdoch closed News of the World in a 
				shock move in July 2012 as a spiralling scandal over phone 
				hacking at the British tabloid threatened to infect the rest of 
				his empire.<br>
				<br>
				In a sensational finale, the 168-year-old paper printed its last 
				edition on July 8, 2012 after claims that it hacked the phones 
				of a murdered girl and the families of dead soldiers, and that 
				it paid police for stories. “Having consulted senior colleagues, 
				I have decided that we must take further decisive action with 
				respect to the paper,” said Murdoch’s son James, chairman of 
				News International, the British newspaper wing of Rupert 
				Murdoch’s News Corporation. The closure sparked immediate 
				speculation that Rupert Murdoch was offering the paper as a 
				sacrificial victim to save his $14bn bid for control of pay-TV 
				giant BSkyB, as a government decision on its ownership was 
				pending. British Prime Minister David Cameron – who has himself 
				faced pressure for his ties to Rupert Murdoch – said the closure 
				of the News of the World should not distract from an ongoing 
				police investigation into the hacking.<br>

				<b>Aung San Suu Kyi<br>
				Harbinger of change in Myanmar<br>
				</b>Aung San Suu Kyi led her party, the National League for 
				Democracy to a sweeping victory in Myanmar’s crucial elections 
				on April 1, 2012 winning 43 of the 45 open parliamentary seats. 
				Calling the results a “a triumph of the people” Suu Kyi’s party 
				won a victory that marks an important turn for her political 
				career and for her nation as it emerges from a half-century of 
				military rule.<br>
				<br>
				Change in Myanmar began in November 2010, when then-new 
				President Thein Sein instituted a set of national reforms. One 
				important element of these reforms included engaging in a 
				dialogue with Nobel Prize winning opposition leader Aung San Suu 
				Kyi and releasing her from a nearly decade-long house arrest. 
				These election results will not, however, alter the balance of 
				Mynamar’s parliament given that only a small number of seats 
				were contested. Regardless, the vote is seen as a harbinger of 
				potential social change and as a key indicator of the current 
				ruling general’s commitment to continuing reforms.<br>

				<b>Lance Armstrong<br>
				Stripped of seven Tour de France titles<br>
				</b>The International Cycling Union announced on October 22, 
				2012 that it would not appeal the US Anti-Doping Agency’s ruling 
				to bar Lance Armstrong for life from Olympic sports for doping 
				and for playing an instrumental role in the team-organised 
				doping on his Tour de France-winning cycling squads. The 
				decision to waive the right to take Armstrong’s case to the 
				Court of Arbitration for Sport, the highest court in sports, 
				formally stripped Armstrong of the seven Tour titles he won from 
				1999 to 2005. “Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling; he 
				deserves to be forgotten in cycling,” Pat McQuaid, the president 
				of the cycling union, known as UCI, said in a news conference in 
				Switzerland. Armstrong, who has vehemently denied doping, has 
				said in the past that he, his teammates and those riders who 
				competed against him would always know he won those seven Tours.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Michael Phelps<br>
				The greatest Olympian<br>
				</b>Michael Fred Phelps II, won four golds and two silver medals 
				at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, making the American 
				swimmer the most decorated Olympian of all time, with a total 
				haul of 22 medals. When Phelps won his 19th medal he eclipsed 
				the previous record of 18 established by Soviet gymnast Larysa 
				Latynina in the 1950s and ‘60s.<br>
				His six medals at the London Olympics also makes him the most 
				successful athlete of the games for the third Olympics in a row. 
				Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals 
				(18, double the second highest record holders), Olympic gold 
				medals in individual events (11), and Olympic medals in 
				individual events for a male (13). In winning eight gold medals 
				at the 2008 Beijing Games, Phelps took the record for the most 
				first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Felix Baumgartner<br>
				Breaking the sound barrier<br>
				</b>Extreme athlete Felix Baumgartner landed a death-defying 
				free fall from 38.6 kilometres above the Earth in a daring feat 
				that marked the world’s first supersonic skydive on October 14, 
				2012. Baumgartner landed safely in New Mexico after reaching a 
				maximum speed of 1,324 kilometres an hour, or Mach 1.24, which 
				is faster than the speed of sound.<br>
				The jump broke a number of records, including the highest 
				free-fall jump ever by a human, the fastest free-fall ever and 
				the highest manned balloon flight by a human. The Austrian 
				native fell from more than three times the height of the average 
				cruising altitude for jetliners and experienced a reported 
				four-minute and 19-second free fall. However, he was short of 
				achieving the longest free fall record, set in 1960 by Col. Joe 
				Kittinger.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Mohammed Mursi<br>
				Egypt’s first civilian elected president<br>
				</b>Mohammed Mursi was sworn in as Egypt’s first civilian, 
				democratically elected president on June 30, 2012 at a historic 
				ceremony in Cairo. Hours after the ceremony, he was saluted by 
				Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, leader of the military council 
				which handed over power. The field marshal also decorated the 
				new president with the Shield of the Armed Forces, the country’s 
				highest honour. In his speech at Cairo University, Mursi said, 
				“The army is now returning to its original role, protecting the 
				nation and its borders.” Parliament, the new president insisted 
				in his speech, had been elected in a free and fair ballot and 
				had been entrusted with drafting a new, democratic constitution. 
				A US-educated engineering professor, Mursi was a professor at 
				the Zagazig University.<br>

				<b>Bidding Adieu<br>
				</b><br>
				A list of 10 most important people who passed away in 2012 after 
				striving in their own unique ways to make the world different<br>
				<br>
				HE Mohammed Bin Ahmed Al Busaidi, who died on November 21, 2012, 
				was the advisor of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said for 
				Religious and Historical Affairs. He was one of the most iconic 
				figures who played a pioneering role in the building of modern 
				Oman since the embryonic period of the Blessed Renaissance. An 
				eminent religious scholar, jurisprudent, historian and 
				educationist, HE Al Busaidi served the nation in different 
				capacities such as the Wali, the Mufti, the Minister of Interior 
				and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.<br>
				<br>
				He will be remembered for his lifelong dedication to knowledge 
				and his exemplary services for the development of science and 
				education in the country. An enthusiastic reader and 
				bibliophile, HE Al Busaidi set up one of the best reference 
				libraries in Oman which is now frequented by university 
				students, researchers and historians. Situated in the Wilayat of 
				Seeb, his library has some of the rarest collections of books 
				and over 4000 manuscripts shedding light on Oman’s ancient 
				history and civilisation. He was also the founder of ‘Risalatul 
				Masjid’ magazine which was first published in 1979.<br>
				<br>
				Neil Alden Armstrong (1930-2012) was an American astronaut and 
				the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also an aerospace 
				engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. 
				Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the US 
				Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his 
				bachelor’s degree at Purdue University and served as a test 
				pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 
				High-Speed Flight Station, now known as the Dryden Flight 
				Research Center, where he logged over 900 flights.<br>
				<br>
				He later completed graduate studies at the University of 
				Southern California. A participant in the US Air Force’s Man in 
				Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programmes, 
				Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his 
				first space flight, as command pilot of Gemini 8, in 1966, 
				becoming NASA’s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. <br>
				<br>
				Norodom Sihanouk (1922-2012) was the King of Cambodia from 1941 
				to 1955 and again from 1993 to 2004. He was the effective ruler 
				of Cambodia from 1953 to 1970. After his second abdication in 
				2004, he was known as “The King-Father of Cambodia”, a position 
				which he retained many of his former responsibilities as 
				constitutional monarch. The son of King Norodom Suramarit and 
				Queen Sisowath Kossamak, Sihanouk held so many positions since 
				1941 that the Guinness Book of World Records identifies him as 
				the politician who has served the world’s greatest variety of 
				political offices. These included two terms as king, two as 
				sovereign prince, one as president, two as prime minister, as 
				well as numerous positions as leader of various 
				governments-in-exile. He served as puppet head of state for the 
				Khmer Rouge government in 1975-1976. <br>
				<br>
				Eric John Ernest Hobsbawm, (1917-2012) was a British historian 
				of the rise of industrial capitalism, socialism, and 
				nationalism. His best-known works include his trilogy about the 
				long 19th century The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789-1848, The 
				Age of Capital: 1848-1875; The Age of Empire: 1875-1914, The Age 
				of Extremes on the short 20th century, and an edited volume 
				which introduced the influential idea of “invented traditions”. 
				Hobsbawm was President of Birkbeck, University of London for ten 
				years until his death. In 1998 he was appointed to the Order of 
				the Companions of Honour, a UK national honour bestowed for 
				outstanding achievement in the arts, literature, music, science, 
				politics, industry or religion. In 2003 he was the recipient of 
				the Balzan Prize for European History since 1900, For his 
				brilliant analysis of the troubled history of twentieth-century 
				Europe and for his ability to combine in-depth historical 
				research with great literary talent.<br>
				<br>
				Whitney Elizabeth Houston (1963-2012) was an American recording 
				artist, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, the Guinness 
				World Records cited her as the most awarded female actor of all 
				time. Houston was one of the world’s best-selling music artists, 
				having sold over 170 million albums, singles and videos 
				worldwide. She released six studio albums, one holiday album and 
				three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, 
				multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston’s 
				crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her 
				prominence on MTV, starting with her video for “How Will I 
				Know”, influenced several African American female artists to 
				follow in her footsteps. <br>
				<br>
				Houston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No 1 
				Billboard Hot 100 hits. She is the second artist behind Elton 
				John and the only female artist to have two number-one Billboard 
				200Album awards (formerly “Top Pop Album”) on the Billboard 
				magazine year-end charts. <br>
				<br>
				Wis&#322;awa Szymborska-W&#322;odek (1923-2012) was a Polish poet, 
				essayist, translator and recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in 
				Literature. In Poland, where she was called “Mozart of Poetry”, 
				Szymborska’s books have reached sales rivaling prominent prose 
				authors. Szymborska was awarded the Nobel prize “for poetry that 
				with ironic precision allows the historical and biological 
				context to come to light in fragments of human reality”.<br>
				<br>
				Her works have been translated into English and many European 
				languages, as well as into Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and Chinese. 
				Szymborska frequently employed literary devices such as ironic 
				precision, paradox, contradiction and understatement, to 
				illuminate philosophical themes and obsessions. Many of her 
				poems feature war and terrorism. In Calling out to the Yeti 
				(1957), she compared Joseph Stalin to the abominable snowman.<br>
				<br>
				Carlos Fuentes Macías (1928-2012) was a Mexican novelist and 
				essayist. Among his works are The Death of Artemio Cruz (1962), 
				Aura (1962), The Old Gringo (1985) and Christopher Unborn 
				(1987). One of the most admired writers in the Spanish-speaking 
				world, Macías had an important influence on the Latin American 
				Boom, the explosion of Latin American literature in the 1960s 
				and ‘70s. His many literary honours include the Miguel de 
				Cervantes Prize as well as Mexico’s highest award, theBelisario 
				Domínguez Medal of Honour. He was often named as a likely 
				candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, though he never 
				won. Fuentes served as Mexico’s ambassador to France from 1975 
				to 1977, resigning in protest of former President Gustavo Díaz 
				Ordaz’s appointment as ambassador to Spain. He also taught at 
				Brown, Princeton, Harvard, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, 
				Dartmouth, and Cornell.<br>
				<br>
				Verghese Kurien (1921-2012) was an Indian engineer and renowned 
				social entrepreneur, best known as the “Father of the White 
				Revolution”, for his ‘billion-litre idea’ or Operation Flood – 
				the world’s biggest agricultural development programme. The 
				operation took India from being a milk-deficient nation, to the 
				largest milk producer in the world, surpassing the USA in 1998, 
				with about 17 percent of global output in 2010-11, which in 30 
				years doubled the milk available to every person. Dairy farming 
				became India’s largest self-sustaining industry. He made the 
				country self-sufficient in edible oils too later on, taking 
				head-on the powerful and entrenched oil supplying lobby. One of 
				the greatest proponents of the cooperative movement in the 
				world, his work has alleviated millions out of poverty not only 
				in India but also outside. Hailed as the “Milkman of India”, 
				Kurien won several awards including the Padma Vibhushan (India’s 
				second-highest civilian honour), the World Food Prize and the 
				Magsaysay Award for community leadership.<br>
				<br>
				Hans Werner Henze (1926-2012) was a German composer of 
				prodigious output best known for “his consistent cultivation of 
				music for the theatre throughout his life”. His music is 
				extremely varied in style, having been influenced by serialism, 
				atonality, Stravinsky, Italian music, Arabic music and jazz, as 
				well as traditional schools of German composition.<br>
				<br>
				Henze was also known for his political convictions. He left 
				Germany for Italy in 1953 because of a perceived intolerance 
				towards his leftist politics and homosexuality. Late in life he 
				lived in the village of Marino in the central Italian region of 
				Lazio, and in his final years still travelled extensively, in 
				particular to Britain and Germany, as part of his work. An 
				avowed Marxist and member of the Communist Party of Italy, Henze 
				produced compositions honouring Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara. The 
				librettist of his requiem for Che Guevara, titled Das Floß der 
				Medusa (The Raft of Medusa), was among several people arrested 
				at the 1968 Hamburg premiere in the riot that followed the 
				placing of a red flag on the stage. Henze spent a year teaching 
				in Cuba, though he later became disillusioned with Castro.<br>
				<br>
				Lakshmi Sahgal (1914-2012) was a revolutionist of the Indian 
				independence movement, an officer of the Indian National Army, 
				and the Minister of Women’s Affairs in the Azad Hind government. 
				Sahgal is commonly referred to in India as Captain Lakshmi, a 
				reference to her rank when taken prisoner in Burma.In 1940, she 
				left for Singapore where she met the members of Netaji’s Indian 
				National Army. She established a clinic for the poor, most of 
				whom were migrant labourers from India. It was at this time that 
				she began to play an active role in the India Independence 
				League. Captain Lakshmi was arrested by the British army in May 
				1945, remaining in Burma until March 1946, when she was sent to 
				India – at a time when the INA trials in Delhi heightened 
				popular discontent with and hastened the end of colonial rule.<br>

				<b>Notable reads</b><br>
				<br>
				OER’s pick of the books published in 2012 consists of four 
				non-fictions and six fictions which also include a graphic novel<br>
				<br>
				<b>The Yellow Birds’<br>
				By Kevin Powers</b><br>
				The Yellow Birds, a novel by Kevin Powers is a superb, moving 
				and insightful book about war and its effects on the men and 
				women who take part in it. The author, Kevin Powers, is a 
				veteran of Iraq in 2004 where this book is set and is now a 
				poet. This combination of first-hand experience and ability with 
				language coupled with great insight and honesty creates 
				something quite remarkable. The book is narrated in the first 
				person by private John Bartle on his first tour of duty in Iraq. 
				The language is heightened throughout, often poetic and 
				sometimes almost hallucinatory. The story is really that of 
				Bartle’s psychological journey and is quite stunning in its 
				evocation of the war itself and of the state of mind of the 
				young man who went through it.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Arcadia<br>
				By Lauren Groff<br>
				</b>Arcadia, Lauren Groff’s poignant and gorgeously written 
				novel, is about a young man who is raised on a failing commune 
				in New York. In the fields of western New York State in the 
				1970s, a few dozen idealists set out to live off the land, 
				founding a commune centered on the grounds of a decaying mansion 
				called Arcadia House. Arcadia follows this romantic utopian 
				dream from its hopeful start through its heyday. Arcadia’s 
				inhabitants include Handy, the charismatic leader; his wife, 
				Astrid, a midwife; Abe, a master carpenter; Hannah, a baker and 
				historian; and Abe and Hannah’s only child, Bit. While Arcadia 
				rises and falls, Bit, too, ages and changes. He falls in love 
				with Helle, Handy’s lovely, troubled daughter.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Canada<br>
				By Richard Ford,</b><br>
				Canada, by Richard Ford, is a magnificent work of Montana gothic 
				told by the son of two inept bank robbers. Ford has polished the 
				plain-spoken lines of this wise novel to an arresting sheen. 
				This is a brilliant and engrossing portrait of a fragile 
				American family and the fragile consciousness of a teenage boy. 
				It is also fascinating in the way it reveals the plot in the 
				opening page and then winds backwards, offering a more and more 
				intimate version of the story. A true masterwork of haunting and 
				spectacular vision from one of our greatest writers, Canada is a 
				profound novel of boundaries traversed, innocence lost and 
				reconciled, and the mysterious and consoling bonds of family.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and 
				Poverty<br>
				By Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson</b><br>
				Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, 
				by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. This racing, wildly 
				ambitious masterpiece answers the question that has stumped the 
				experts for centuries: Why are some nations rich and others 
				poor, divided by wealth and poverty, health and sickness, food 
				and famine? Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps 
				ignorance of what the right policies are? Simply, no. None of 
				these factors are either definitive or destiny. Acemoglu and 
				Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made institutions that 
				underlie economic success .<br>
				<br>
				<b>Bring Up the Bodies<br>
				By Hilary Mantel<br>
				</b>Bring Up the Bodies, the sequel to Hilary Mantel’s 2009 Man 
				Booker Prize winner and New York Times bestseller, Wolf Hall, 
				delves into the heart of Tudor history with the downfall of Anne 
				Boleyn. This darkly magnificent sequel covers Thomas Cromwell’s 
				brutal efforts to end the failing marriage between Henry VIII 
				and Anne Boleyn. The action of Bring UpThe Bodies occupies only 
				nine months, and within that nine months it concentrates on the 
				three weeks in which Henry’s second wife is arrested, tried and 
				executed.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk<br>
				By Ben Fountain</b><br>
				Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, by Ben Fountain, is a darkly 
				comic gut-punch of a war novel – Catch-22 updated for a new era. 
				Billy Lynn and his Bravo squad mates have become heroes thanks 
				to an embedded Fox News crew’s footage of their firefight 
				against Iraqi insurgents. During one day of their bizarre 
				Victory Tour, set mostly at a Thanksgiving Day football game at 
				Texas Stadium, they’re wooed by Hollywood producers, smitten by 
				Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, and share a stage at halftime with 
				Beyonce.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Behind the Beautiful Forevers<br>
				By Katherine Boo</b><br>
				Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai 
				Undercity, by Katherine Boo, is an astonishing tale of squatters 
				living in a tiny slum in India’s largest city as they wend their 
				way through corruption and governmental indifference. Katherine 
				Boo unearths stories both tragic and poignant--about residents’ 
				efforts to raise families, earn a living, or simply survive. 
				These unforgettable characters all nurture far-fetched dreams of 
				a better life.<br>
				<br>
				<b>House of Stone<br>
				By Anthony Shadid</b><br>
				House of Stone: A Memoir of Home, Family, and a Lost Middle 
				East, by Anthony Shadid. This humorous and wonderful memoir 
				explores how Shadid devoted to restoring his great-grandfather’s 
				home in Lebanon shortly before he died, at 43, on assignment in 
				Syria. House of Stone is not a work of Middle East reportage; it 
				is a memoir, devoted to Shadid’s deeply personal quest to 
				uncover his heritage in war-torn Lebanon. Shadid’s great skill 
				as a journalist was that of a master storyteller, and he’s never 
				been more effective than in his final book.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Building Stories<br>
				By Chris Ware</b><br>
				Building Stories is a graphic novel by Chris Ware. Neighbours 
				share walls of deep melancholy in this masterful book-in-a-box 
				of 14 “easily misplaced elements” that are as readily lost as a 
				life. Unabashedly rooted in the pre-digital age, Ware’s new work 
				is really 14 individually bound books, ranging from gorgeous 
				hardbacks to thin pamphlets, housed in an oversized box. With 
				his trademark obsessive precision, Ware presents the grind and 
				folly of everyday life in the most exhilarating fashion.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ninety Days: A Memoir of Recovery<br>
				By Bill Clegg</b><br>
				Ninety Days: A Memoir of Recovery by Bill Clegg is raw, honest 
				and very well-written tale of alcoholism and drug abuse by a 
				big-name literary agent. The goal is ninety. Just ninety clean 
				and sober days to loosen the hold of the addiction that caused 
				Bill Clegg to lose everything. With six weeks of his most recent 
				rehab behind him he returns to New York and attends two or three 
				meetings each day.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Outstanding Cars<br>
				</b><br>
				Global automobile demand will continue to rise despite marked 
				disparities between regions. Auto sales volumes will likely 
				climb 6 per cent year-over-year in 2013. OER draws up a list of 
				10 best cars in 2012<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audi A7 <br>
				</b>In 2012, Audi’s A7 debuted with an exterior that elicits 
				stares. The new A7 embodies what good a car design professes to 
				achieve: solid proportions, silky lines and a little surprise to 
				feed our curiosity. The A7 does all of this with a beautiful 
				touch that satisfies both sedan and sport enthusiasts. The 
				grille is a brand signature for Audi. The angle of this grille 
				has a rake to it, giving the front end an aggressive appearance. 
				Same goes for the lights and the sweep of the break line in the 
				fender. You have aggression in the front of the car and 
				aggression in the back. There is a lot of definition and volume 
				in the body around the wheels and through the doors. Consumers 
				get a sense of how well-built and solid the car is based on this 
				visual weight. This is very important in making the car feel 
				like it’s an Audi.<br>
				<br>
				<b>BMW 1M Coupe<br>
				</b>It’s the least expensive of BMW’s mighty high-po M cars and 
				also the least pretty. The flared fenders and gaping mouth 
				tacked onto the base 1 Series make it even chunkier, not sleek 
				and lithe like a typical sports car. There’s a surplus of 
				performance – a turbocharged 335-hp straight-six engine, mammoth 
				tires and brakes, and stiffer suspension – but speed is not the 
				main thrill. The other subjective measures, such as perfectly 
				linear brake action, steering that feels hard-wired to your 
				brain, delicate road signals communicated through the seat, and 
				the creamy six-speed manual transmission, all combine for a 
				dynamic delight. And it’s those traits that separate simply fast 
				cars from the truly rewarding ones.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Dodge Durango <br>
				</b>The Durango is a vehicle that provides nearly limitless 
				opportunities. It seats seven in a cleanly designed interior, 
				can tow up to 7400 pounds and has the mechanical hardware—a 
				robust center differential rather than a light-duty clutch 
				pack—to traverse terrain that would humble most sport utes. But 
				the Durango is not simply a talented off-roader. There’s no 
				on-road penalty for its capabilities. It drives with a sharpness 
				that belies its 2.5 tonnes and its commodious interior. On the 
				highway, drivers can luxuriate in the rich materials, 
				throne-like seats and an abundance of available features, 
				including a 360-hp V8 and adaptive cruise control.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Jeep Wrangler <br>
				</b>The constant struggle for Jeep is civilising the Wrangler 
				without killing its off-road prowess. After all, no matter how 
				capable it may be on the Rubicon Trail, a scant few customers 
				are willing to endure a choppy on-road ride or an interior 
				racket that sounds like a snare drum in an oilcan. In the past 
				18 months, the Wrangler has nearly been upended. The designers 
				ditched the granite-hard interior for one with softer materials 
				and gentler curves. They redesigned and thickened the soft top 
				to reduce wind noise. A more powerful and efficient driveline 
				replaced the ancient 3.8-liter V6 and four-speed automatic. The 
				new Wrangler, which is available with two or four doors, is the 
				most livable ever. And it still has the steep approach and 
				departure angles, stout running gear and hardware – skidplates 
				and locking differentials – that make it the most capable 
				off-roader available.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Infiniti M Hybrid<br>
				</b>The Infiniti’s 67-hp electric motor complements the 
				3.5-litre V6 with nearly 200 lb-ft of instantaneous electric 
				torque at liftoff. This hybrid zings, bolting to 60 mph in a 
				little over five seconds. Yet speed is not the sole goal of a 
				luxury car. “Luxury” is loosely defined as something you don’t 
				need but want anyway. And the extra performance of the hybrid 
				system has only increased our desire for this sedan. The gas – 
				electric powertrain is nearly transparent in its operation. At 
				speeds of up to 62 mph it can silently draw on the lithium-ion 
				battery pack and electrically glide for more than a mile. The 
				brakes – which have the tough task of integrating the standard 
				hydraulic system with energy regeneration – feel, well, normal. 
				Plus, the system delivers 29 combined EPA mpg, a 28 per cent 
				improvement over the nonhybrid M.<br>

				<b>Ford Mustang Boss 302<br>
				</b>The 2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 is the kind of fully 
				realised, perfectly crafted performance car that comes along 
				only once in a decade. The C-stripe graphics and cue-ball 
				shifter; legendary Trans Am racing names like Bud Moore, 
				Parnelli Jones and Kar Kraft were all connected to the Boss. It 
				gives you chills. Side-exit exhausts with removable sound 
				baffles are standard. They make a crackly, intoxicating howl 
				just three feet beneath your ears. The no-cost-option Recaro 
				sport seats feel every bit as mission critical as the naturally 
				aspirated 444-hp 7500-rpm 5.0-liter V8 under the hood. The 
				oiling system is capable of withstanding cornering loads greater 
				than 1.0 g’s. In other words, Ford wants you to hit a racetrack, 
				mount some sticky tires and put the smack down.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Toyota Camry Hybrid<br>
				</b>There was a time when airbags existed solely to protect the 
				driver, but as technology improves, it’s now possible to help 
				protect every passenger in the car. That’s why the 2012 Camry is 
				the first in its class to offer ten airbags standard. With its 
				2012 redesign, the Camry Hybrid jumped to the top of the 
				family-sedan category. One eye-opener for a car of this size is 
				its impressive 38 mpg overall fuel economy, the best in class 
				and even better than some smaller hybrids that lack the Camry’s 
				performance. Other high points include a comfortable ride; a 
				roomy, quiet cabin; fairly quick acceleration; and for 2012, a 
				nicer interior and somewhat crisper handling (although the Camry 
				is still no sports sedan).<br>
				<br>
				<b>Honda Accord 2012<br>
				</b>The four-cylinder 2012 Accord proves that when Honda plays 
				to its strengths, it is better than anyone at producing vehicles 
				with a supernaturally fine balance of attributes. That this is 
				still true while Honda is widely acknowledged to have lost some 
				of its product magic puts the all-around excellence of the 
				four-cylinder Accord in stark relief. This is a big sedan 
				(without a sunroof, roomy enough to reside in the EPA’s Large 
				Sedan category) that’s lighter on its feet than many sports 
				coupes you could mention. The primary controls are so perfectly 
				matched to each other that this not-exactly-sporty-looking sedan 
				can traipse along the tightrope of your favourite back road with 
				precision and utter predictability. It will return 33 mpg on the 
				highway; a well-equipped EX version costs just one nice dinner 
				more than $25,000 (a little more for the coupe); and it’s a more 
				natural heel-and-toe enabler than most sports cars.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Nissan NV<br>
				</b>Nissan’s new NV full-size van (offered in three weight 
				ratings: base 1500, 2500 HD and 3500 HD) brings fresh and handy 
				ideas to the rarely changed van segment. Nissan started with a 
				passenger cabin more like that of a pickup truck for additional 
				room and easier access – both to the cab and underhood. Stout, 
				durable hinges let the cargo doors swing back beside the body 
				(243 degrees, with a stop at 90 degrees. A tall-body version 
				accommodates walk-through access for tradesmen or taller cargo; 
				a standard-height one suits those who need their 20-foot-long 
				vans to fit under overhead garage doors. Add a best-in-class 
				turning circle of 45.2 feet, plenty of threaded holes in the 
				interior that make mounting racks a snap, and a relatively 
				subdued interior, and it’s a tool that doesn’t feel like work to 
				use.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Porsche Boxster / Cayman<br>
				</b>A sports car should be transportation for the spirit as well 
				as the body, and few sports cars offer a more transcendent 
				driving experience than these mid-engined fraternal twins. In 
				either roadster or hatchback form, they’re distinguished by 
				exceptional balance, eager responses, and a link between car and 
				driver that’s free of excessive filtration. Over the years, the 
				sinews of Porsche’s entry-level twosome have grown stronger and 
				more flexible; the output of their flat-six engines has climbed 
				as high as 330 horsepower in the new Cayman R; and their styling 
				has become less 911-derivative. Another trait that upstages the 
				911 is the twins’ practicality: Yes, they give up two only 
				grocery- or small-dog-appropriate seats to their big brother but 
				in return offer covered storage fore and aft.<br>

				Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo,<br>
				Scarlett Johansson, Clark Gregg, Samuel L Jackson<br>
				Studio: Buena Vista<br>
				Director: Joss Whedon<br>
				Marvel’s The Avengers, or simply The Avengers is an American 
				superhero film produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by 
				Walt Disney Pictures, based on the Marvel Comics superhero team 
				of the same name. It is the sixth installment in the Marvel 
				Cinematic Universe. In The Avengers, Nick Fury, director of the 
				peacekeeping organisation SHIELD, recruits Iron Man, Captain 
				America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor’s 
				adoptive brother Loki from subjugating Earth. Development of The 
				Avengers began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill 
				Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in 
				May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released 
				in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the 
				film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on 
				board in April 2010 and rewrote the screenplay originally 
				written by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in 
				Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio, in 
				August and New York City in September. The film was converted to 
				3D in post-production. The Avengers premiered on April 11, 2012, 
				at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California and received 
				positive reviews from most film critics and set numerous box 
				office records, including the biggest opening weekend in North 
				America and the fastest film to gross $1 billion. The Avengers 
				grossed $1.51bn worldwide, and became the third highest-grossing 
				film of all time.<br>

				<b>The Dark Knight Rises<br>
				</b>Theatrical release: July 20, 2012<br>
				Box office: $1.08bn<br>
				Starring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway,<br>
				Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman<br>
				Studio: Warner Bros.<br>
				Director: Christopher Nolan<br>
				The Dark Knight Rises is a superhero film directed by 
				Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother 
				Jonathan Nolan and the story with David S Goyer. Featuring the 
				DC Comics character Batman, the film is the third and final 
				installment in Nolan’s Batman film trilogy, and it is the sequel 
				to The Dark Knight (2w 008). Christian Bale reprises the lead 
				role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of Michael 
				Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Morgan 
				Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as Dr Jonathan Crane. 
				The film introduces two main characters to Nolan’s series: 
				Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar whose appearance in 
				Gotham City sets in motion a chain of events that leads Batman 
				to come out of retirement; and Bane (Tom Hardy), a mercenary 
				whose objective is to destroy Gotham with a thermonuclear 
				weapon. Christopher Nolan was initially hesitant about returning 
				to the series for a second time, but agreed to come back after 
				developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would 
				conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew 
				inspiration from Bane’s comic book debut in the 1993 Knightfall 
				storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 
				storyline No Man’s Land. The Dark Knight Rises is currently the 
				seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, the 
				second-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the second highest 
				grossing superhero film of all time.<br>

				<b>On the cutting edge<br>
				</b><br>
				A list of the best gadgets of 2012 reflects shrinking product 
				life cycles as companies vie to upgrade their wares to offer the 
				latest innovations<br>
				<br>
				<b>Samsung Galaxy S III<br>
				</b>The Samsung Galaxy S III is one of the most coveted consumer 
				electronic devices in the world. And there is a good reason for 
				that. The Galaxy S III is unbelievably light and has a great 8 
				mega-pixel camera with a flash and a choice between auto and 
				manual focus, that can also take Full HD 1080p videos. The 
				internal memory of either 16 GB, 32 GB or 64GB can be expanded 
				by a 32 GB MicroSDHC memory card, making it possible to have up 
				to 96 GB storage. Its ultra fast Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A9 
				processor provides a wonderful mobile experience and snappy 
				responsiveness. The 4.8 inch HD Super AMOLED display is probably 
				the best on the market and is a pleasure to look at. In short, 
				this is one of the best smart phones of 2012.<br>
				<br>
				<b>iPhone 5<br>
				</b>The iPhone 5 is a touchscreen-based smartphone developed by 
				Apple. It is the sixth generation of the iPhone and succeeds the 
				iPhone 4S. The phone is a slimmer, lighter model that introduces 
				a higher-resolution, 4-inch screen to the series with 16:9 
				widescreen aspect ratio support. The phone also includes a 
				custom-designed ARMv7 processor called the Apple A6, an update 
				to Apple’s mobile operating system known as iOS 6, and support 
				for LTE. Apple held an event to formally introduce the phone on 
				September 12 . After Apple began taking pre-orders on September 
				14 , over two million were received within 24 hours.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Microsoft Surface<br>
				</b>Microsoft Surface is a series of tablets designed and 
				marketed by Microsoft. The Surface comes in two versions: one 
				with Windows RT and another with Windows 8 Pro. The Windows RT 
				model uses an ARM CPU, while the Windows 8 Pro model will use an 
				Intel CPU. Both models can install new applications via the 
				Windows Store, however only the Windows 8 Pro model allows the 
				installation of traditional third-party desktop programmes. The 
				Microsoft Surface line features VaporMg, a moulded magnesium 
				casing that houses Surface’s components paired with a PVD 
				finish.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Amazon Kindle Fire 2<br>
				</b>The successor to Amazon’s flagship tablet -- the Kindle Fire 
				2, comes with an upgraded processor, memory and battery but 
				otherwise identical to the original model. New model, same 
				design as before -- that pretty much sums up the Amazon Kindle 
				Fire 2, as it’s an exact facsimile to its predecessor in every 
				aspect – both in its construction and choice of materials. 
				Analysing its body meticulously from head-to-toe, it’s safe to 
				say that it has one clean appearance – with only its two 
				speakers, power button, 3.5mm headset jack, and microUSB port 
				occupying its sides. Employing the same 7” IPS LCD display as 
				the first generation, it’s effective enough for most things – 
				such as reading a book or surfing the web.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Canon EOS 5D Mark III <br>
				</b>In 1987 Canon unveiled the EOS 650 to the world. It was the 
				Japanese manufacturer’s first 35mm autofocus SLR and the start 
				of the EOS system. With its fully-electronic lens mount, in-lens 
				aperture and focus motors, and reliance on electronic button and 
				dial operation, Canon’s EOS system established a blueprint that 
				all successive camera systems have followed. Now, 25 years 
				later, the Canon EOS 5D Mark III is the latest model in the 
				line. The 5D Mark III has a 22MP full frame sensor in a body 
				that’s based on the EOS 7D design, and with a 61-point AF system 
				borrowed from the flagship EOS-1D X. Indeed the 5D name itself 
				is almost misleading; compared to its predecessor the Mark III 
				is essentially a completely new model, with every major system 
				upgraded and updated. In a way it’s better seen as a full-frame 
				7D, with that camera’s control layout, extensive customisability 
				and 63-zone metering sensor.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Microsoft Windows 8<br>
				</b>Though technically not a gadget, Windows 8 has been one of 
				the most anticipated technology launches of the year. Windows 8 
				introduces significant changes to the operating system’s 
				platform, primarily focused towards improving its user 
				experience on mobile devices such as tablets to rival other 
				mobile operating systems (such as Android and iOS), taking 
				advantage of new or emerging technologies (such as USB 3.0, UEFI 
				firmware, near field communications, cloud computing and the 
				low-power ARM architecture), new security features (such as 
				malware filtering, built-in antivirus software, and support for 
				secure boot (a UEFI feature which allows operating systems to be 
				digitally signed to prevent malware from altering the boot 
				process), along with other changes and performance improvements.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Panasonic TX-P50VT50<br>
				</b>The Panasonic TX-P50VT50 is the flagship plasma TV in 
				Panasonic’s 2012 Viera range. One of the unique features on the 
				VT50 range is an Infinite Black Ultra filter, which aims to 
				deliver better than ever black levels. On the outside, the VT50 
				has a single-sheet-of-glass-design, and there are minor 
				differences in the styling compared with the GT model. You also 
				get two pairs of active-shutter 3D glasses in the box – 
				Bluetooth-powered and rechargeable – and a Viera Touch Pad 
				Controller remote control. All the other features found 
				elsewhere in the Viera 2012 range are present.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Nikon D4<br>
				</b>The Nikon D4, 16MP full-frame professional DSLR is capable 
				of shooting at 10 frames per second with full autofocus. In 
				addition to a host of ergonomic improvements, the D4 also sees 
				the expansion of its video capabilities, to the extent that 
				Nikon is describing it as a ‘multi-media DSLR.’ The cameras gain 
				an Ethernet port, a 91,000 pixel metering sensor and an uprated 
				AF sensor that can work in lower light and with smaller aperture 
				lenses. Its sensitivity range can be expanded to the equivalent 
				of ISO 204,800 and adds illuminated controls to make it easier 
				to work in the low-light situations in which such a setting 
				becomes useful. The D4 also becomes the first camera to make use 
				of the XQD memory card format.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Nintendo Wii U <br>
				</b>Wii U is a video game console from Nintendo and the 
				successor to the Wii. The system was unveiled during Nintendo’s 
				press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 on 
				June 7, 2011, and was released on November 18, 2012 in North 
				America. It is the first entry in the eighth generation of video 
				game home consoles. The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to 
				support high-definition graphics, capable of producing video 
				output up to 1080p, and has 2 GB of memory with half dedicated 
				to the console’s operating system. The console was released in 
				two versions: a ‘Basic’ white-coloured version with 8 GB of 
				internal Flash storage; and a ‘Deluxe’ black-coloured version 
				with 32 GB of Flash storage.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Samsung Galaxy Note II<br>
				</b>The Samsung Galaxy Note II is a smartphone–tablet computer 
				hybrid designed, developed and marketed by Samsung. It is the 
				successor to the Samsung Galaxy Note, and is the second device 
				in the company’s Note series, which places emphasis on the use 
				of a stylus. Employing a 1.6 GHz quad-core processor, the device 
				sports a 5.55-inch (141 mm) diagonal display with 720p 
				resolution, 2 GB of RAM, and a maximum of 128 GB storage (by 
				using a 64 GB microSD card with the 64 GB model). Upon its 
				launch, it was the first Samsung phone to come with Android 
				version 4.1 “Jelly Bean” as standard.</td>

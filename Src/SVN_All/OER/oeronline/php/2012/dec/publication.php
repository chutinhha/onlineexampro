						the occasion of the 42nd National Day, United Press &amp; 
						Publishing has published the eighth edition of ‘Oman-A 
						Nation on the Move’. The bilingual book published every 
						year has been highlighting for the last eight years the 
						developments made by the country in various 
						socio-economic fields with a special focus on inclusive 
						growth.<br>
						<br>
						This year’s edition is dedicated to His Majesty’s 
						endeavour to transform Oman into a modern state with 
						well-developed infrastructure, vibrant economy and 
						peaceful society offering the highest living standards 
						to the people of the country. It presents an in-depth 
						analysis of the progress made by the Sultanate in the 
						key sectors. The economic report unravels the unique 
						measures taken-up in the last few years to enhance the 
						role of women and promote young talent in the roadmap 
						for future development. In addition, the senior 
						Government officials share the remarkable achievements 
						of the State in meeting the aspirations of the different 
						sections of the society. In an age marked by global 
						economic slowdown where every country is trying to 
						attract foreign capital and trade, Oman has become a 
						preferred destination for the international investment 
						community. OMAN – A Nation On The Move 1970-2012 
						features the Sultanate’s growing co-operation with 
						leading economies. The ambassadors of six leading 
						countries, in their own words, describe the growing 
						bilateral economic bond with Oman and the factors that 
						make their states committed to work jointly with Oman’s 
						Government and the private sector.<br>
						<br>
						With distinct identities and features, the nine regions 
						of the Sultanate are the pillars of Omani society which 
						is marked by a uniform culture and heritage. Through a 
						pictorial route, the edition presents the unique 
						propositions of each of the regions to showcase 
						different facets of Oman. Overall, OMAN – A Nation On 
						The Move 1970-2012 is the latest and the most updated &amp; 
						comprehensive reference point to understand why Oman is 
						widely respected among the international community as a 
						perfect role model of a modern nation connected to its 
						cultural roots. <br>
						<br>
						The most authentic and comprehensive economic report 
						marked by unique content is also available digitally in 
						the form of an eBook on

						edition of Jawharat Oman showcases a new set of 41 super 
						achievers who have performed par excellence in their 
						respective fields<br>
						<br>
						The Sultanate of Oman has been a land of amazing natural 
						beauty, rich history and culture and above all, a 
						friendly society with people of great talent. Today, 
						there’s an entire generation of Omanis for whom the word 
						‘impossible’ simply does not exist. They are the 
						‘Jewels’ – a cut above the rest – who’ve gone the 
						distance to achieve their dreams and ambitions.<br>
						<br>
						Last year, Jawharat Oman (JO) profiled 40 super 
						achievers who have been front-runners in their 
						respective domains; whether they were scientists with 
						ground-breaking research or sports persons who reached 
						the pinnacle of success. This year again, we went in 
						search for the most inspiring stories and compiled a new 
						edition with 41 super achievers. Sports, science, arts, 
						fashion, technology – there are super achievers in every 
						possible sphere and JO has brought the stories of these 
						people at the forefront. The edition tracks the success 
						journey of each of these achievers, the efforts they 
						have taken to reach the pinnacle of success, the 
						difficulties that they faced and the vision to shape 
						their laurels. It explores the qualities which have made 
						them stand out.<br>
						<br>
						The 2012 edition of JO is published by United Media 
						Services (UMS). According to Alpana Roy, executive vice 
						president, UMS, “Jawharat Oman is truly a one-of-a-kind 
						publication and with the second edition I hope that it 
						continues to serve as an inspiration to all Omanis and 
						drives them to work towards their goals. In a world of 
						triumphs, the ones that are shared with others hold much 
						meaning and I have no doubt that each personal story 
						will serve to further strengthen readers’ resolves and 
						foster more inspiration in them.”<br>
						<br>
						“It is also pertinent to bring to the fore the 
						organisations who have been a part of this unique and 
						compelling publication. Their unwavering support, right 
						from the start, truly demonstrates their encouragement 
						to these Jewels of Oman.”</font></td>

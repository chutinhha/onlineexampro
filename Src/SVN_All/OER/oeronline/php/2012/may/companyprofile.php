				Within a short span of 18 years, Al Jassar Group has established 
				itself as a fast growing multi divisional firm with strong 
				presence in trading, manufacturing, real estate, contracting, 
				health etc. VT Saileswaran, Managing Director, who has been in 
				the vanguard of this journey, talks about the success, values 
				and vision of his business. Muhammed Nafie reports<p align="center" class="style13" dir="ltr">

				<br>
				It all started with one man who stepped out of the comfort zone 
				of a senior management position with a leading Kuwait-based 
				company to venture into an own enterprise in the Sultanate in 
				1994. Over the last 18 years, it has grown to a group of 
				diversified companies establishing itself as a pioneer in 
				providing multiple services to a wide range of industries in 
				Oman, as diverse as trading, construction, manufacturing, 
				infrastructure and telecommunication. In addition, it runs one 
				of the leading private hospitals in the city and signed JVs with 
				several international companies to manufacture and supply their 
				products in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. It 
				was the vision and strong minded-pursuit of its managing 
				director VT Saileswaran that enabled Al Jassar Group, which had 
				a humble beginning as a trading company, to emerge as a multi 
				divisional firm with 500 plus employees.<br>
				<br>
				Sailsweran started his career in early 80s with Danish giant 
				Rockwool for which he worked at Copenhagen for two years looking 
				after its Middle East marketing; he later joined the Kuwaiti 
				major Al Gahnim Industry where he was the regional manager for 
				Kimmco Insulation for 15 years. “When I started Al Jassar 
				Trading it was virtually a one-man company. Later, we grew and 
				branched out to different areas launching Al Jassar Telecom, 
				Apollo Medical Centre, Muscat, Habitat International, Habitat 
				Furnishing, Group VTS SBN, Malaysia, Baek Suk Engineering &amp; 
				Partners, Dura Line Middle East etc.<br>
				<br>
				<b>A leap forward <br>
				</b>Al Jassar Trading, the first venture of the group, has 
				gained a good reputation since its inception for offering 
				high-quality and highly reliable engineering, industrial and 
				construction materials backed up by excellent sales support. It 
				represents many well-reputed manufactures from across the globe 
				in construction, water &amp; waste water conveyance, roads etc. <br>
				<br>
				Al Jassar Telecom which was set up in 2008 has partnered with 
				internationally renowned telecom and IT vendors and was able to 
				provide the telecommunication solutions with advanced 
				technologies like GPON-FTTH, Wimax, GIS, integrated security 
				solutions, intelligence building solutions, LED lighting 
				solutions, IP telephony solutions, geographical information 
				system etc. “We are the first Omani company to do FTTH network 
				projects for Haya Water, Omantel and Nawras. WE have connected 
				2000 plots as well as 200 houses,” says Saileswaran.<br>
				<br>
				Habitat International provides services in property management, 
				real estate and housekeeping. It serves commercial buildings, 
				serviced apartments, residential buildings, guest houses, 
				shopping malls etc. undertaking administration, management, 
				maintenance, security operations and space planning.<br>
				<br>
				Al Jassar Group has a well-equipped manufacturing unit and 
				joinery division to produce a variety of furniture to cater to 
				the needs in interior designing, furnishing and space planning. 
				In addition, there are two state-of-the art- furniture showrooms 
				in Watayah for readymade office furniture from Canadian leader 
				Global Furniture and for sofas made by renowned German 
				manufacture Hilker. Saileswaran also informed that he is looking 
				forward to entering into a JV with Global Furniture to 
				manufacture some of their products in Sohar for Middle East 
				market.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Quality health care <br>
				</b>Apollo Medical Centre (AMC), Muscat was set up in 2005 in 
				association with Apollo Hospitals Group, India, Asia’s largest 
				and most trusted healthcare group, setting new benchmarks in 
				providing the most advanced and state-of-the-art healthcare 
				services in the Sultanate. Equipped with modern and 
				state-of-the-art operation theatres and modern Intensive Care 
				Unit (ICU), AMC is the only centre in Sultanate offering regular 
				superspecialty consultation clinics by visiting doctors from 
				Apollo Hospitals Group –India in Spine, Orthopedics, Arthroscopy 
				&amp; Knee, Neurosurgery, Liver, Cardiology etc.<br>
				<br>
				“According to me, health care is not a big money making 
				business,” says Saileshwaran. “It is rather a service for the 
				nation. We require high-value equipment for everything and 
				getting doctors is another difficulty as it entails a protracted 
				recruitment process lasting up to six to eight months.”<br>
				<br>
				AMC renders speedy treatment to all critical illnesses in 
				cardiology, general medicine, diabteology &amp; endocrinology, ENT, 
				general surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, orthopedics, 
				ophthalmology, plastic &amp; cosmetic surgery, dermatology, 
				dentistry, neurology and neo-natology and paediatrics etc. “We 
				have achieved another landmark with the launch of telemedicine 
				facility, the first installation in the Sultanate, whereby 
				people living in Oman can access the best of healthcare services 
				from the world-renowned Apollo Hospital’s doctors in India,” 
				adds Saileswaran.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Way to go <br>
				</b>The latest venture of Al Jassar Group is Dura-Line Middle 
				East (DLME), a JV with Dura-Line India to produce cable ducts 
				and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes for water, 
				wastewater, and natural gas pipelines and other industrial 
				applications, in Sohar. With an installed capacity of 6,000 
				tonnes a year, the plant combines the technological strength of 
				Dura-Line and A-D Technologies with the local market service 
				support of Al Jassar. The company has invested $7.8mn in setting 
				up the plant. “The entire plant, covering a built-up area of 
				7,000 m2, was completed within 90 days. The plant and machinery 
				and the quality systems are exactly identical to the Dura-Line 
				India facilities,” avers Saileswaran.<br>
				<br>
				Dura-Line Middle East currently has two extrusion machines 
				capable of producing in the size of 20mm to 250mm and the sizes 
				beyond 250mm can be easily complemented from the Indian units to 
				provide the full size range to the end users in the Middle East. 
				“Our major customers in Oman are organisations that are engaged 
				in building water, wastewater, natural gas pipelines and 
				irrigation systems such as Haya Water and Public Authority for 
				Electricity and Water,” Saileswaran added. On the advantages of 
				setting up the project in Sohar, Saileswaran said that it was a 
				strategic location for exporting the products to the Middle East 
				and North Africa region. “We are aiming at exporting 60 per cent 
				of the company’s products.”<br>
				<br>
				Baek Suk Engineering &amp; Partners is another contracting arm of 
				the group in cooperation with the Korea-based principal. 
				Saileswaran says the company has currently got a subcontract 
				from Hyundai Rotem which was awarded the contract of Al Khoud 
				sewage networking project.<br>
				<br>
				Exuding confidence about the upbeat prospects of the company in 
				the coming years, Saileswaran says, “My future outlook is to do 
				the best to strengthen the business. Our vision is to be one of 
				the most successful companies in the region and the mission is 
				to give quality service to the customers.” He also informs that 
				Al Jassar Group is seriously considering launching a bigger 
				multispecialty hospital in association with Apollo India to give 
				all secondary and tertiary care facilities under one roof.&#8194;</td>

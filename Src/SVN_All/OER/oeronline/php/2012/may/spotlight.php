						<font face="Verdana" size="1">The importance and size of 
						the global commercial air conditioning (CAC) market has 
						grown to prominence in recent years, gradually evading 
						the shadow of the residential air conditioning (RAC) 
						market. Such growth has not been limited by tempering 
						market conditions in the traditional CAC strongholds of 
						North America, Europe, and Middle East. With demand for 
						CAC products accelerating in other parts of the world, 
						other regions have now entered the fray.<br>
						However, Air conditioning is a necessity in the Middle 
						East, given its geographical location, climatic 
						conditions and the ever-evolving infrastructure. Massive 
						construction drives which spurred the development of 
						numerous residential and commercial real estate 
						projects, and high population growth have fuelled demand 
						for air-conditioners and cooling systems in the region. 
						The region’s annual commercial air conditioning (CAC) 
						market volume is expected to reach approximately $4bn, a 
						35 per cent growth from 2010.<br>
						<br>
						Regional construction boom and increasing investments 
						from China have boosted the growth. Another factor is 
						the 2022 Qatar World Cup, which has greatly increased 
						construction in Qatar in preparation for the mega event 
						in the region. This directly translates to a need for 
						CAC in a region that experiences hot and humid 
						conditions for most of the year.<br>
						<br>
						The boom in real estate development together with the 
						growing emphasis on greater cooling facilities and the 
						resultant increase in power demand have all contributed 
						to creating huge opportunities for manufactures and 
						distributors in district cooling. This trend has 
						received added impetus in recent years with the lack of 
						sufficient generation, transmission and distribution 
						infrastructure to meet projected power demands.<br>
						<br>
						In Oman, the air-conditioner and refrigerator market 
						account for a whopping 65 to 70 per cent of all business 
						in the white goods market. The market size of 
						air-conditioning products is around 200 K units a year 
						in Oman. The market size for Refrigerators is around 80 
						K units a year. Also due to a very fertile commercial / 
						industrial projects scenario, there is also a great 
						business opportunity for different air-conditioning 
						concepts like chiller, ducted type or DVM(digital 
						Variable Multi. Traditionally, the Sultanate has been a 
						market for window ACs. That trend is rapidly changing as 
						improved standards of living and more sophisticated 
						lifestyles push customer preference to split and ducted 
						air-conditioners. This is in line with global trends. 
						Apart from lifestyle changes and economic development, 
						price reductions in split units have driven demand for 
						these models of air-conditioners. What’s more, the 
						air-conditioner which was earlier regarded as a seasonal 
						product now boasts decent sales figures even during 
						off-season. In Oman extreme temperatures and high levels 
						of humidity have spurred the demand for high quality, 
						energy efficient, environment friendly and reliable 
						cooling solutions. The Omani government, in keeping with 
						these trends and demands, has established the highest 
						standards in setting requirements for all new projects 
						being developed for both the tourism and real estate 
						sectors. In order to meet these requirements and to 
						reduce the demand on the governments for energy the 
						District Cooling solution has been developed and 
						implemented throughout the GCC.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Environmentally friendly<br>
						</b>Industrial outlook has shifted towards a greener and 
						more sustainable future, requiring customers as well as 
						manufacturers to truly focus on environmentally-friendly 
						technologies.<br>
						In 2011, Sharp launched its latest AC technology in 
						Oman, with the addition of ‘All Aluminum 
						heat-exchangers’ and ‘Plasmacluster Ions’ into its 
						line-up of ACs. This innovation not only reduces the 
						unit’s weight by 40 percent, it also reduces its 
						refrigerant requirement by a staggering 50 percent. 
						“Sharp has always focused on improving customer’s lives 
						through its technologies and we used this launch to 
						showcase yet another innovation to the local and global 
						market, which we believe tackles some of the challenges 
						faced by the Air-Conditioning industry in the region,” 
						says AG Tony assistant general manager OMEC.<br>
						<br>
						<b>World’s first tropical inverter AC<br>
						</b>Panasonic has recently introduced the world’s first 
						tropical inverter air conditioners which are designed to 
						specifically meet the climatic challenges of the Middle 
						East. The new range of air conditioners comes with the 
						Smart Inverter Compressor, which are powerful, fast and 
						extremely energy efficient. With searing temperatures in 
						the region, the new technology has made it possible for 
						an 18000 Btu air conditioner to reach up to 22000 Btu, 
						and a 24000 Btu model to reach up to 27000 Btu, based on 
						the requirements resulting in faster cooling. 
						Furthermore, the new technology precisely manages the 
						speed of the compressor, resulting in up to 30 per cent 
						less energy consumption compared to a non-inverter 
						model.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Crystal cooling<br>
						</b>Samsung’s Crystal AC combines unsurpassed technology 
						and breathtaking beauty. The Crystal AC improves the 
						quality of air while cooling to provide the utmost in 
						comfort. Powered by Comfort Care technology, the Crystal 
						air-conditioned range features a Multi-Step filter which 
						dramatically improves air quality to protect health. 
						Comfort Care adjusts humidity while cooling in 
						conjunction with an Ideal Comfort Index, to ensure cool 
						comfort all the time. The Smart Saver function 
						automatically operates the AC in the least amount of 
						time necessary to cool the room, saving up to 31% 
						electricity while protecting the environment. The 
						S-Inverter aids this energy saving by ensuring less 
						fluctuation and motor running time, while maintaining 
						the optimum temperature.<br>
						<br>
						<b>General’s wall mounted split AC<br>
						</b>Oman was the first country in GCC to have the honour 
						of launching “General” 5 speed control wall mounted AC 
						in May 2011. The new “General”, designed with its 
						innovative technology, reduces resistance to return air, 
						thereby allowing more air contact with the Heat 
						Exchanger which results in better cooling. This 5-speed 
						wall mounted split AC has a wide range of fan. ‘Airflow’ 
						or quite simply Air movement inside a conditioned space 
						is one of the key factors that contribute to ‘comfort’. 
						The airflow reaches up to 15 metres, and gives a better 
						cooling effect in to unwieldy longish rooms. Besides 
						being environment friendly, this new model also 
						incorporates additional heat exchangers, which means 
						even better cooling performance, while consuming lesser 
						energy, giving users handsome savings in electricity 
						bills.<br>
						<br>
						<b>RF Systems and Multi V<br>
						</b>The heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) 
						industry has moved steadily beyond simple air 
						conditioning units for households and into more 
						intricate and sustainable systems that cover entire 
						buildings. Riding the wave of this trend, variable 
						refrigerant flow (VRF) air-conditioning systems have 
						proliferated widely. Despite their humble beginnings 
						more than 20 years ago, VRF systems have now evolved 
						into advanced air conditioning systems that provide 
						customizable temperature control for all occupants 
						within a building or building complex.<br>
						<br>
						Speaking at the launch of LG’s VRF system Multi V III 
						commercial air-conditioner earlier this year, HS Paik, 
						President of LG Electronics Gulf FZE said, «As a company 
						with a strong focus on producing energy-efficient 
						products, we feel that the MULTI V III addresses all the 
						major HVAC requirements of businesses in the Gulf. With 
						this product, we are in a strong position to work with 
						our dealers and business partners in the region to make 
						LG the leading provider of smart and efficient HVAC 
						solutions. And, this has definitely proved to be the 
						case as the Multi V III has earned $15m so far since it 
						was released in the Middle East.<br>
						<br>
						VRF sales in 2011 grew 500 per cent compared to the 
						overall single air conditioning market›s 21 per cent 
						growth. The sales of this system continue to grow 
						steadily as the expansion of the Middle East CAC market. 
						Advances in technology and growth in the HVAC market 
						have gone hand in hand as greater demands have 
						necessitated bright ideas and the effective 
						implementation of those ideas. This is reflected in the 
						growth of VRF systems worldwide. The VRF systems market 
						globally averaged an annual growth of 15 per cent over 
						the last five years and reached an impressive $4.3bn in 
						2010. Much of the initial growth was seen in major 
						markets, but there has been a noticeable shift to 
						emerging markets. This trend has led a growing number of 
						industry observers to predict considerable growth in the 
						future. According to research conducted by LG Air 
						Conditioning and Energy Solution Company, the VRF 
						systems market will reach a staggering $7.3bn by 2013, a 
						40 per cent jump from last year›s tot.<br>
						<br>
						Midea has also emerged as a leader in variable 
						refrigerant flow (VRF) systems with most of the big 
						names in world buying from them under their brands. MDV-D 
						is Media’s range of VRFs which unlike many others is the 
						new generation of multi-modular systems for commercial 
						and residential air conditioners that uses the ‘digital 
						scroll’ technology. A digital scroll system is a multi 
						system with a DIGITAL SCROLL Copeland compressor which 
						is able to simplify air-conditioning systems, regulate 
						efficient performance and save more energy by digitally 
						regulating the output to the required capacity as 
						multiple indoor units can be connected to a single 
						outdoor unit and these indoor units can be controlled 
						independently and collectively.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Latest VRV<br>
						</b>Daikin’s VRV III series has specially designed 
						models for high outdoor temperatures, with an extensive 
						capacity ranging from 8 to 36 HP. It was Daikin which 
						developed the world’s first variable refrigerant volume 
						system (VRV), maintaining a nearly constant room 
						temperature without the typical temperature fluctuations 
						It is equipped with advanced built-in intelligence and 
						flexibility. The unit can operate in adverse conditions 
						where the temperature reaches as high as 52°C. This 
						series incorporates Daikin’s latest technologies, 
						including long piping and high external pressure, to 
						meet the diverse needs of our customers.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Reliable compressors<br>
						</b>Wansa air conditioners have silent and highly 
						reliable compressors. Their built-in air filter not only 
						kills bacteria but removes dust, pollen, mould and any 
						airborne particles. The active carbon filter eliminates 
						odours and deactivates harmful chemical gases in the 
						air. It also traps common household air pollutants such 
						as dust and smoke. The sleep /economy mode lowers or 
						raises the room temperature setting by one degree. <br>
						<br>
						<b>How to make your AC energy efficient<br>
						</b><br>
						A few handy tips to increase the life and improve the 
						efficiency of your AC<br>
						<br>
						The maintenance of an AC is an area that most consumers 
						and commercial clients need to learn about. It is not 
						always necessary to order dealer service when a little 
						bit of care and maintenance on your part will go a long 
						way in improving the working life of your air 
						conditioner. Simple things such as regular cleaning of 
						the filters, helps increase the life of your AC. 
						However, it is more prudent for you to enter into an 
						annual maintenance contract with the authorised service 
						centre of your brand of AC, so that the units are 
						maintained at a nominal cost with little hassle. The 
						following few tips will help one maintain an 
						air-conditioner in an easy simple way:<br>
						<br>
						Understand that an air conditioner, apart from cooling, 
						also conditions the air inside your room like humidity, 
						dust, order, fungus, bacteria, etc. All good quality ACs 
						have cooling, humidity control, dust removal, anti 
						fungal and anti-bacterial functions and these need to be 
						used properly. Split ACs are now affordable, very quiet 
						and energy saving as compared to window ACs. They are 
						also more hygienic and prevent birds from making their 
						nests in air gaps, rodents creeping in and air from 
						leaking.<br>
						<br>
						Clean the filter of your AC once a fortnight, or when 
						the indicator lamp on the front panel lights up. Dirty 
						air filters force your system to work harder to push 
						cool air through your home. This uses more energy and 
						places extra strain on the air conditioning system. Take 
						the filter(s) out and hold it to the light. If the dust 
						on the filter is so think that you can’t see much light 
						shining through the filter, it’s time for new filters. A 
						clean air filter, unobstructed by the dirt and other 
						debris, will save you money on energy costs and prolong 
						the life of your air conditioner. If you do not know 
						where your air filters are or how to replace them, ask 
						your HVAC technician to show you during an inspection.<br>
						<br>
						Keep the doors of your rooms open for a few minutes 
						every day to allow some fresh air to enter. Do not spray 
						any type of deodorant or perfume into your split ACs. 
						Doing so will result in foul smell, necessitating a 
						cleaning of the indoor unit. Avoid smoking in an AC room 
						as indirect smoke can harm other family members and it 
						is very difficult to remove the odour even by servicing.<br>
						<br>
						For safety, always turn the thermostat and outdoor 
						unit’s breaker off before doing any work around that 
						outdoor unit. The coil can be cleaned using a 
						soft-bristle brush to gently sweep the fins. Always 
						brush in line with the fins, and be gentle because the 
						fins can bend easily. Because the fan pulls air through 
						these fins, you can expect to find dust clinging to the 
						fins. Removing this dust and other debris will reduce 
						resistance and increase efficiency.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Choosing the right AC<br>
						</b><br>
						A majority of buyers tend to choose an AC based on its 
						cooling qualities ignoring the quality of air<br>
						<br>
						As the heat turns up and thermostats turn down, many 
						homeowners begin the process of choosing a new 
						air-conditioning unit or replacing an old one. 
						Purchasing an air-conditioner in a country such as Oman, 
						with high temperatures and humidity, is an important 
						appliance decision that affects the entire family or 
						office. When you buy an AC, make sure the unit is 
						tropicalised (designed for Middle East region’s high 
						ambient conditions), the after-sales support is strong, 
						the power consumption and noise level is low, the unit 
						has air-purifying capabilities, the design complements 
						the interior of the room and it matches your budget. <br>
						<br>
						A majority of buyers tend to choose an AC based on its 
						cooling qualities and ignore the quality of air. Some of 
						the new ACs in the market provide air purifying 
						functions which also removes allergens from the air 
						thereby increasing the quality of air. Air conditioners 
						in the Middle East are used primarily for cooling.<br>
						<br>
						Always consider the following main factors — the cooling 
						requirement, the room size (area, height and exposure to 
						sunlight), the climatic conditions and the number of 
						occupants in the room . The room size and climatic 
						conditions determines the BTU requirement to cool the 
						room. BTU stands for British Thermal Unit, defined as 
						the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 
						one pound of water by one degree. The heat gain added to 
						a room by a person at rest is about 230 BTUs per hour. 
						So a 10,000 BTU air conditioner is capable of removing 
						10,000 BTUs of heat per hour. The higher the BTU rating 
						of an air conditioner, the easier and faster it is to 
						cool a room.<br>
						<br>
						International standards recommend approximately 30 BTU 
						per square foot of the room, but in Gulf weather 
						conditions at least 90-100 BTU per square foot are 
						recommended.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Split air conditioner<br>
						</b>When cooling rooms with uninsulated ceilings, great 
						rooms, or southern or western room exposures, step up to 
						the next BTU size. If a building is not centrally air 
						conditioned, a customer has three options: a split, 
						window or portable air-conditioner. A window air 
						conditioner is a single unit with its components housed 
						inside the unit and it requires no inter piping for 
						installation. The AC can be installed through an opening 
						in the wall. The main benefit with this is the ease of 
						installation as the split air conditioner has two parts, 
						the outdoor condensing unit and the indoor fan coil 
						unit. A split air conditioner can be a single split unit 
						where one fan unit is connected to one condenser or 
						multi split unit where one condensing unit is connected 
						to more than one fan unit. Since the split units have an 
						outdoor condensing unit, they are quieter in operation. 
						Portable or self-standing units are small units used in 
						spaces where installation is difficult.</font></td>

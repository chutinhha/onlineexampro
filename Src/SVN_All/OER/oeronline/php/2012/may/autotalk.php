				<b>The Centennial is a loaded top-end luxury sedan offering 
				value for money, writes Visvas Paul D Karra after an extensive 
				test-drive</b><br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The Centennial has been conceptualised by Hyundai as an ultra 
				luxury sedan to compete with vehicles manufactured by German 
				luxury auto giants. After test driving the Centennial on the 
				roads of Muscat we can safely conclude that it is a good buy for 
				those who want value for money but don’t want to spend an 
				exorbitant sum of money on German brands.<br>
				<br>
				Plush interiors (has four roomy leather seats) with wood grain 
				panels, a massage system in the right rear VIP seat, active head 
				rest, driver memory seat, rain sensor for windshield wipers, 17 
				speaker Lexicon audio system and numerous other features will 
				leave you basking in the luxury of the Centennial.<br>
				<br>
				Take for example, the seating which has been made into a 
				science. Redefining the sumptuous inside the Centennial, every 
				seat is a masterpiece of design and engineering. An interior 
				environment with the finest comfort and convenience is provided 
				from structural aesthetics through the appropriate arrangement 
				of genuine materials.<br>
&nbsp;</font><p align="center" style="margin: 10px; ">
				<img border="0" src="images/autotalk-may-12-2.jpg" width="246" height="230"><p align="justify" style="margin: 10px; ">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				Seat climate is controlled by thermoelectric devices in the seat 
				back and cushion that regulate the temperature and humidity, 
				thereby maximising comfort and optimising freshness for the 
				occupants. The headrests have wing sections that can be adjusted 
				up to 30 degrees for passenger comfort. The whole ambience is 
				one of pure, but practical, opulence.<br>
				<br>
				When you take into account the safety features loaded into the 
				car and the smart cruise control which brakes and accelerates 
				intelligently when it detects obstacles in front of you, 
				cruising on any road, whether tough city roads or leisurely 
				highways, is a sheer pleasure. Nine airbags mean additional 
				safety inside the Centennial. Front side and full-length curtain 
				airbags are supplemented by a driver’s knee airbag and side 
				airbags for the rear seat passengers. Working together with the 
				pre-safe seatbelts and electronic active headrests, they provide 
				a cocoon of maximum safety.<br>
				<br>
				For our drive, we took the Centennial 4.6 GLS AT 11, powered by 
				a V8 best-engine award winner for two years, with a 6-speed 
				transmission and a tiptronic option as well. Although slightly 
				sluggish on the pickup, the car is very agile on the trot and 
				nimble on the turn. The electro-hydraulic power steering wheel 
				is very smooth and light if you take into account the size of 
				the car.<br>
				<br>
				The V8 engine is a piece of refined modern sculpture with a 
				world class power unit. By using a sophisticated high pressure 
				die-casting system, the compact all-aluminium Tau V8 
				incorporates variable valve timing and a variable induction 
				system for maximum efficiency. It is clean and lean, yet still 
				delivers a massive 366ps with 44.8 kg•m torque at 3,500rpm. 
				Electronic continuous damping control in real time keeps the 
				Centennial stable, steady and smooth, by increasing or 
				decreasing ride height for varying road conditions. Disc brakes 
				with ABS, TCS and BAS combined with a pre-safe seatbelt means 
				you are always in the safest position.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 10px; ">

				<br>
				<br>
				The adaptive front lighting system (AFLS) provides optimal 
				forward field of vision by adjusting the beam angle of the 
				headlights while driving at night while LED outside mirror 
				repeaters, elegantly integrated into the mirror housings, 
				increase visibility and safety when turning. Puddle lamps 
				mounted under the outside mirrors, illuminate the way for driver 
				and passengers when getting out of the car. The wrap-around 
				energy-saving distinctive LED rear lights resembling the shape 
				of an eagle’s wings increase visibility both day and night.<br>
				<br>
				A 3.5-inch TFT LCD monitor for detailed information is built 
				into the supervision cluster. On it, information is displayed in 
				coloured text or icon images with sounds. The screen not only 
				displays the view from the front and rear cameras, it 
				superimposes in simple graphic form the perfect guidelines to 
				park. Simply follow them for totally problem-free parking. The 
				parking guide system uses the rearview camera, and a simple, 
				superimposed graphic with parking guidelines to help direct 
				drivers into even the tightest parking spots. Front and rear 
				parking sensors offer an extra line of protection in case you 
				get too close to another car or object.<br>
				<br>
				All in all, the Centennial’s other names could be convenience, 
				luxury and safety.&#8194;<br>

						<br>Oman Forum – Building National Talent witnessed two 
						heated and thought-provoking panel discussions on 
						education and training; youth employment policies and 
						initiatives; identification of talent gaps and 
						challenges; and creation of guidelines to set up the 
						roadmap for future<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						HE Mohsin Al Balushi, Advisor to the Ministry of 
						Commerce &amp; Industry and Chairman of The Public Authority 
						for Manpower Registration stated that the government 
						considers human resources development as a crucial 
						investment for nation building. <br>
						<br>
						Speaking at the Oman Forum – Building National Talent, 
						organised recently at Al Bustan Palace Ritz-Carlton, he 
						said renaissance has opened up new vistas of scientific 
						progress and educational development. “The Research 
						Council continues to take various innovative steps to 
						improve the quality of scientific and technical 
						education in the country. The Public Authority for 
						Manpower Registration seeks to strengthen the 
						coordination between various institutions in the 
						country. It will help private sector companies to find 
						out the capable hands and the job seekers to get updated 
						about the right opportunities. The authority has taken 
						various initiatives and signed several agreements to 
						strengthen the agreement between both private and public 
						sectors,” he stated.<br>
						<br>
						The event was organised by Alam al-Iktisaad Wal A’mal 
						(AIWA), Oman’s premier business magazine published by 
						United Press &amp; Publishing (part of UMS Group). The half 
						day-long event comprised two panel discussions on the 
						state of education and training, youth employment 
						policies and initiatives, identification of talent gaps 
						and challenges and creation of the guidelines to set up 
						the road map for future. The relevant stakeholders from 
						all walks of the society including the government, 
						Majlis Al Shura, private sector, HR experts and civil 
						society deliberated on the various dimensions of 
						building national talent.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Talking at the event, HE Dr Abdullah <br>
						</b>Bin Mohammed Al Sarmi, undersecretary, Ministry of 
						Higher Education said, “It is high time we shifted from 
						consuming knowledge to producing knowledge, by emerging 
						as knowledge based economy. The task of building 
						national talent and equipping youngsters and enabling 
						them to contribute to the nation building is a 
						collective responsibility to be shouldered both by the 
						private and public sectors. The ministry of higher 
						education sends students to over 40 countries for higher 
						studies. English is the main language and the medium of 
						study in all these countries. They come back well 
						trained and equipped to take up the challenging tasks 
						awaiting them in the local industry.<br>
						<br>
						But we don’t send them to Latin American countries 
						because of the concerns about the security and education 
						environment in those countries. Although we have sent 
						some students to Japan recently, we had to shift them to 
						other countries because of the language problems.”<br>
						<br>
						Among the other panelists, Mundhir Al Barwani, HR 
						director, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) said, 
						“Private sector companies ought to play a big role in 
						building national talent. PDO accords great importance 
						to train its employees and make them capable of handling 
						new challenges. We send out diploma holders every year 
						abroad to complete their studies. In addition, we give 
						in-house training in all areas for our employees.”<br>
						<br>
						Hussain Bin Salman Al-Lawati, vice chairman and MD, Oman 
						Cables Industry said, “There is no denying the fact that 
						the foundation of our education system is strong and our 
						labour law is strong enough to create relevant job 
						opportunities for Omanis. But now, we have to build on 
						this good foundation in secondary education to develop a 
						high-quality and professionally sound higher education 
						system to meet the new requirements of various 
						industries in our fast developing country. We need to 
						concentrate more on developing the skillsets and 
						capabilities required by the job market in the country.”<br>
						<br>
						Oman Forum – Building National Talent was organised in 
						association with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), 
						Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, 
						Ministry of Civil Services, Sultan Qaboos University, 
						The Research Council (TRC) and Oman Society of 
						Contractors. AhliBank, Voltamp, Galfar and Omran were 
						the strategic partners whereas Omantel, Oman Cables 
						Industry and Vale were the associate partners for the 
						prestigious forum. The event was webcasted live on

						<b>Oman Green Awards has rolled out the ‘green’ carpet 
						for the third edition of its annual prestigious awards 
						ceremony to be held on June 5 at Al Bustan Palace Hotel</b><br>
						<br>
						<br>
						Oman Green Awards (OGA), Sultanate’s first environmental 
						award to honour outstanding environmental vision, 
						endeavours and achievements of corporates and 
						individuals, will hold the third edition of its 
						prestigious award ceremony on June 5 at Al Bustan 
						Palace, A Ritz-Carlton Hotel. HE Mohammed Salim Said al 
						Toobi, Minister of Environment and Climate Affairs, will 
						preside over the function as the chief guest and 
						felicitate winners of the nine different categories of 
						the awards.<br>
						<br>
						Oman Green Awards is the ultimate recognition for 
						companies, institutions and individuals in Oman, who 
						demonstrate a commitment towards responsible consumption 
						and sustainable growth. The OGA honours and celebrates 
						their vision in leading the way to a cleaner, greener 
						tomorrow; and offers a unique opportunity to be part of 
						a national platform for this cause.<br>
						<br>
						The OGA is being held in association with the Ministry 
						of Environment and Climate Affairs, Ministry of Health 
						and Muscat Municipality; and representatives from these 
						august organisations will attend the green celebrations, 
						which coincide with the World Environment Day. The event 
						has received massive support from corporate houses and 
						individuals who have made green mission a priority. Oman 
						Oil Marketing Company (OOMCO), OCTAL and Muriya Tourism 
						Development have joined OGA as strategic partners and 
						Sadolin and Green Cover as the support partner to keep 
						the green torch burning bright in the country. The media 
						partners are Times of Oman and Al Shabiba while Infoline 
						is the call centre of the event. The printing partner is 
						Oman Printers &amp; Stationers. <br>
						<br>
						OOMCO’s general manager of operations, engineering and 
						HSSE, Faisal Al Shanfari said, “Being an Omani company, 
						OOMCO has the responsibility to take up the 
						environmental awareness to the public and across the 
						corporates. OOMCO believes that Oman Green Awards would 
						be a right platform for corporates and individuals to 
						come up with great ideas and actions on sustainable 
						development of the country with a mission to protect the 
						environment.”<br>
						<br>
						Explaining some preventive measures taken by OOMCO to 
						preserve the environment Al Shanfari added, “We use 
						double wall FRP tanks, the latest leak detection 
						systems, to prevent underground leak at our retail 
						filling stations. In another step towards offsetting the 
						carbon footprint, we have introduced aluminum road 
						tankers for transporting in order to reduce fuel 
						consumption. In addition, we have LED light in retail 
						filing stations and an ambient air monitoring facilities 
						in Mina Al Fahal area.”<br>
						<br>
						“Oman Green Awards offers a unique opportunity for OCTAL 
						to participate in a national environmental awareness 
						platform,” expressed Nicholas Barakat, CEO of OCTAL. 
						“OCTAL is committed to minimising the environmental 
						impact of its day-to-day operations by integrating 
						environmental management as a standard business practice 
						across the organisation. We believe in continuous 
						improvement and transparency and therefore have engaged 
						third party sustainability experts like Renewable Choice 
						Energy to analyse, track and disclose our environmental 
						performance.”<br>
						<br>
						Explaining the measures taken by OCTAL to reduce its 
						carbon footprint, Barakat said, “OCTAL has successfully 
						eliminated five energy-intensive stages of the 
						conventional PET sheet production process, reducing 67 
						per cent of energy consumption. With the entire energy 
						requirements derived from clean combustion natural gas, 
						the specially adapted burners consume up to 20 per cent 
						less gas. As a result, the company’s PET sheet, DPET™, 
						boasts a 25 per cent lower carbon footprint than 
						conventional APET as confirmed by Renewable Choice 
						Energy and Intertek Expert Services. The unprecedented 
						environmental advantages of DPET™ has also encouraged 
						local companies to use OCTAL’s proprietary packaging 
						material which is creating a ripple effect in 
						contributing to reducing global carbon footprint.”<br>
						<br>
						Commenting on its tie-up with OGA, Chandra Lahiri, CEO 
						of Muriya Tourism Development, said, “We have partnered 
						OGA 2012 to encourage and support the awareness and 
						accreditation of green initiatives in Oman. Since its 
						foundation, Muriya has been conscious about preventing 
						any negative environmental impacts on the existing flora 
						and fauna in and around its projects.”<br>
						<br>
						He added that Muriya’s ITC project ‘Salalah Beach’ hosts 
						a greenhouse with thousands of plants to be placed 
						around the project. “We have planted over 1,000 coconut 
						palms along the beach, and aim to have a total of 50,000 
						plants in the project with 1 million sq m of grass. Both 
						Salalah Beach and Jebel Sifah already have a ratio of 25 
						per cent build-up in comparison to the landscaping. Our 
						other initiatives include using alternate energy 
						sources, appointing specialists for environment 
						protection, setting up recycling plant at Bidiya and 
						deployment of mooring buoys. We have also established 
						buffer zones to preserve environment within our 
						projects.”<br>
						<br>
						“Times of Oman has become synonymous with providing 
						cutting edge news and views to its readers day after 
						day,” said Aziz K Baker, advertisement manger, Muscat 
						Press &amp; Publishing House. “But our responsibility to our 
						subscribers extends beyond just dishing out daily news 
						which is why we have partnered with Oman Green Awards, 
						the country’s first environment awards instituted to 
						recognise eco-protection initiatives. If we have to 
						conserve our good earth for the future, then everyone 
						needs to pitch in with green efforts in the present. We 
						have always accorded top priority to environmental news 
						in both the Times of Oman and Al Shabiba, which means 
						that readers are getting educated about the importance 
						of protecting the nature. Oman Green Awards has become 
						the torch-bearer of environmental activities which are 
						being carried out by the Sultanate’s corporate world.”<br>
						<br>
						N Balachandran, chief operating officer of Sadolin 
						Paints (Oman) commented, “Sadolin was the first paint 
						company in the entire GCC to be certified for ISO 14001 
						in 1998; and we have annual targets for continuous 
						reduction in water, energy and wastage generation per 
						unit of production. We also have a strong association 
						with AkzoNobel, the largest paint company in the world; 
						and our products are compliant to Euro 2010 standards.”<br>
						<br>
						He added, “It is our constant endeavour as an ISO 14001 
						and OHSAS 18001 certified company to go beyond the 
						boundaries of our plant. As of now, we are the only 
						paint company in Oman to market water based products 
						which are LEED compliant (VOC of less than 50 gms per 
						liter). In 2011, we launched Planet Supra, the only 
						thermal barrier coating to be certified by the Clinton 
						Climate Initiative; Planet Supra is also the only 
						Thermal Barrier Coating for which the parent company, 
						Sci paints japan, Inc gets carbon credit based on sales. 
						Being a responsible corporate entity our association 
						with OGA is thus natural; as we believe that our 
						participation is also the best way to communicate the 
						environmentally friendly proposition of our company. 
						Through this association, we hope to support OGA in 
						their noble initiative to raise consciousness about 
						environment protection and sustainable development in 
						the Sultanate.”<br>
						<br>
						Conceived from a perceived need to motivate behavioural 
						change and increase awareness in relation to the 
						protection and preservation of our environment, the OGA 
						has been able to make the corporates, individuals and 
						organisations in the country more serious about building 
						environmental sustainability into their business 
						practices.<br>

				<b>Rally champion Hamed al Wahaibi and Oman football national 
				team captain and English Premier League star Ali al Habsi have 
				teamed up to co-found a road safety awareness organisation – 
				Safety First. The sporting icons share their views on the 
				initiative with Mayank Singh</b><p align="center" class="style13" dir="ltr">

				<img border="0" src="images/beyondboardrooms-june-12-1.jpg" width="500" height="333" hspace="13" vspace="3"><p align="justify" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<br>
				<b>How did the idea of doing something for road safety occur to 
				you?<br>
				Hamed: </b>We all know the seriousness of this issue; we all 
				have our near and dear ones lost in the past, so we are closely 
				touched by it. When His Majesty spoke about it in a speech in 
				2009, I felt a personal obligation to do something about this 
				issue. It’s also a way of paying back to society for all the 
				love and popularity that I have got from the people of Oman.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ali: </b>My close relationship with Hamed was one of the most 
				important things that prompted me to get associated with this 
				cause. Secondly, we need to help in saving the lives of Omanis. 
				Both of us want to use our profile to serve the country. Road 
				safety is a national issue and a tragedy and we want to 
				contribute to this cause.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The problem with celebrity endorsements is that they engage 
				with a cause and soon disengage and move on. How will you 
				sustain this long term commitment?<br>
				Hamed:</b> We are founders of Safety First and that itself 
				brings in a measure of commitment. I will be devoting 50 per 
				cent of my working time to Safety First. The idea is to make 
				Safety First a superstar in its own right, over a period of time 
				with the entire nation being its ambassador, so that it is not 
				limited to me or Ali Al Habsi.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ali:</b> If one is committed to a cause, one will find the 
				time. For example, yesterday we did a video on road safety and I 
				will be active on social media avenues like Facebook and 
				Twitter. When I come back to Oman with the national team or on 
				my holiday, I will use my time to spread the message of road 
				safety by visiting people in schools and villages. My goalkeeper 
				glove will sport the Safety First logo.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Is Safety First an NGO or a private company?<br>
				Hamed:</b> We have registered it as an LLC company, but with an 
				internal agreement that it will be a non-profit organisation. 
				The reason for this is that an LLC has less bureaucracy and 
				gives you more freedom. In future, we want to make Safety First 
				into more of an association. We are aiming to reduce road 
				accidents by 50 per cent by the year 2020.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is the basis of this 50 per cent reduction figure and is 
				it achievable?<br>
				Hamed:</b> The 50 per cent reduction figure comes from a United 
				Nations study. There are initiatives which have been studied and 
				researched for years and we are using the same methodology by 
				converting it to suit the needs of our country and society.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How is the initiative going to be funded?<br>
				Hamed:</b> At present it is being personally funded by the two 
				co-founders. In future we will be looking at raising money from 
				the government, businesses, etc. I believe that there is an 
				interest in contributing to a cause like road safety, but we are 
				not approaching anyone right now because first we want to 
				showcase what we are worth.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Are you confident that you have got off to a good start?<br>
				Hamed:</b> I am very confident and the way that things are 
				shaping up reassures me that we are on the right path.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ali:</b> I am very happy about the way the initiative has 
				taken off and we are confident about the future.&#8194;<br>

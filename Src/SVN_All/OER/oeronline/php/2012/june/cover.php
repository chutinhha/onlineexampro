				The NTI BizPro Awards 2012 were presented in a glittering 
				ceremony at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, recently. Anisa Al Raissi, a 
				2009 recipient of the NTI BizPro Young Achievers award and the 
				master of ceremonies for the evening commenced the proceedings 
				by inviting Hani Al Zadjali to deliver a welcome address. A 
				winner of the 2010 Young Achievers Award, Hani said, “NTI BizPro 
				has been recognising and rewarding the most important asset of 
				any organisation, which is human resources. It is this resource 
				that takes a company from good to great and today we are 
				celebrating our future.” Khalid Ansari, partner, KPMG gave a 
				detailed presentation on the evaluation process. BizPro Awards 
				2012 got close to 100 nominations, out of which 10 candidates 
				made it to the pre-final stage and five to the grand final. 
				Khalid added that the nominees were judged on skills, decision 
				making acumen, result orientation, presentation and 
				communication skills.<br>
				<br>
				HH Sayyid Tarik bin Shabib al Said, director, Renaissance 
				Services and Stephen Thomas, CEO, Renaissance Services were 
				invited on stage to present the NTI BizPro Awards 2012 to the 
				three Young Achievers who had emerged as the winners braving a 
				long and tough assessment process. As Raissi announced the names 
				of the three winners – Murtadha Al Lawati, head of corporate 
				communications, Ahlibank; Abbas Hassan <br>
				<br>
				Al Lawati, manager, equity group investment banking, BankMuscat 
				and Sami Mohsin Al Sheikh, general manager, human resources, 
				Enhance – the august gathering burst into spontaneous applause. 
				Each one of the winners were presented with a trophy and a 
				certificate. In addition, Renaissance Services awarded a 
				scholarship of RO2,500 to the three winners. <br>
				<br>
				In his acceptance speech Mohsin said that this honour had placed 
				greater responsibility on his shoulders. Abbas felt that young 
				Omanis can achieve the unachievable through dedication and hard 
				work. Murtadha elaborated on his beliefs like self confidence 
				and learning from failures. The special guest of the evening 
				Yuthar Al Rawahy, chairperson, The National Association of 
				Cancer Awareness (NACA), in her speech talked about corporate 
				citizenship and the growth of NACA over the years. “Learn what 
				is unique in you and build upon it,” added Yuthar. Lawrence 
				Alva, CEO, NTI presented Yuthar with a token of appreciation. 
				Amaar Sulaiman al Rawahi, a BizPro winner from 2011 delivered 
				the vote of thanks expressing his gratitude on behalf of NTI to 
				everyone who had attended the function. As the curtains came 
				down on NTI BizPro Awards 2012, its time to look forward to the 
				next edition of the awards.<br>
				In the following pages we profile ten young Omanis who made it 
				to the pre final stage of the NTI BizPro Awards. Keep an eye out

				<b>A versatile persona<br>
				</b><br>
				Murtadha Al Lawati, Head-Corporate Communications, Ahlibank has 
				refused to be strait jacketed in one discipline by developing 
				his multifarious talents<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you give us a brief on your educational and professional 
				background?<br>
				</b>I graduated from the American University of Sharjah with 
				honours in international studies with a concentration on 
				international economics. I was involved in a number of 
				extra-curricular activities in college. I was the president of 
				the Omani Cultural Club for two years and our club was voted as 
				the best social activity club in the University. In my final 
				year I ran for the presidency of the student government. It was 
				a difficult task but I won with 68 per cent of the votes. I came 
				back and joined E&amp;Y in the transaction advisory team. I went 
				onto work with BankDhofar and Bank Sohar. I joined Bank Sohar as 
				an assistant manager in premiere banking but within six months I 
				was shifted as senior manager – corporate banking handling 
				government liabilities. After three years I shifted to Oman 
				Football Association (OFA), as its director – media and 
				communication. OFA was a life changing break as it gave me a 
				chance to showcase my abilities to communicate, and HH Sayyid 
				Khalid Al Busaidi, Chairman, OFA gave me that opportunity. I 
				travelled all around the world with the national team and had a 
				wonderful experience. I joined Ahlibank seven months ago as the 
				head of corporate communications. I am a news presenter on Oman 
				TV and have five shows on radio. I have recently been elected as 
				a board member of the National Cancer Association and I am also 
				on the board of Oman Cycling Association.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You are a banker, TV host, radio jockey and an office bearer 
				in various associations. How do you manage these 
				responsibilities?</b> <br>
				I am good at managing my time. I plan ahead for the week and see 
				as to where my TV and radio slots are and make sure that nothing 
				overlaps. I also make sure to communicate to the head of the TV 
				station about the days where I am free in advance, the same goes 
				for radio as well. If you do not enjoy what you are doing, you 
				get tired, but if you enjoy what you are doing, it comes 
				naturally to you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You are one of the winners of the NTI BizPro Young Achievers 
				Award 2012. What are the values that have enabled you to win 
				this accolade?</b><br>
				I am good at communicating and motivating people. One thing that 
				people do not realise is that there is a big difference between 
				being a manager and a leader. As a manager you delegate work to 
				people, while as a leader you delegate authority and let people 
				do the work. I am good at doing the latter.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You are a role model for young Omanis, what advice would you 
				give to the youth of the country?</b><br>
				My advice is simple – ‘nothing comes easy in life.’ Secondly, 
				the couple of things that are important in life is having faith 
				in yourself and cultivating the right attitude. If you do not 
				have the right attitude, you are never going to get anywhere in 
				life. Whatever skills that you get from your education is just 
				the start of your journey and there is still a lot more that you 
				need to learn and do before you can reach a stage where you can 
				lead people. Be patient and take all the opportunities that come 
				your way and make the best out of them.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You have achieved a lot in a short span of time. What are 
				your future plans and aspirations?<br>
				</b>I want to stay and grow in Ahlibank, but somewhere down the 
				line I want to get involved with reshaping the interaction 
				between the government and society. This can come about either 
				through the media, radio, TV or being involved with the 
				government itself.<br>

				<img border="0" src="images/cover-june-12-3.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #808080;" class="style17" width="500" height="333"></font><p align="justify" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				<br>
				<b>Work is worship<br>
				</b><br>
				From being a part-time waiter while studying to becoming a GM is 
				truly a tremendous progression for anyone. Sami Mohsin Al 
				Sheikh, GM - Human Resources, Enhance Operating Companies Oman, 
				says it has been all hard work and perseverance<br>
				<br>
				<b>Your comments about winning the NTI BizPro Young Achiever 
				Award?<br>
				</b>It is an honour to be granted the BizPro Young Achievers 
				Award for 2012. This honour has fuelled my purpose to impact and 
				improve the lives and skills of my country’s women and men 
				through the role I play in human resources. I will continue to 
				work hard using the combination of my professional and 
				educational experiences.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How do you feel about being one of the youngest HR manager in 
				the country?<br>
				</b>I think our success depends on the dedication of our 
				employees. I am managing a team of 18 people in my department 
				and we have been working hard to ensure that our company is a 
				great place to work. We put a strategy in place to develop our 
				local manpower and create opportunities for career progression. 
				Another practice, amongst many other initiatives, is the reward 
				and recognition programme for our employees. I have to lead my 
				team with a lot of patience and perseverance which no school or 
				executive programme can teach. The more we help others to 
				achieve, the more we become better. Once the team becomes 
				better, the company becomes strong.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What do you want to be in the next five years?<br>
				</b>I believe in working hard and doing my best, and the 
				opportunities will follow. The sky is the limit. But I will not 
				limit myself to one industry. I have proven to myself that I can 
				do anything as long as I put my mind to it. Probably, I will 
				eventually start a hotel on my own.<br>
				<br>
				But I would like to tell the youth of the country to have an 
				open mind and an attitude that helps you to work hard. Any form 
				of work is worship. I would also like to state that giving it 
				all and proving your worth is more important. The fruits will 
				come later on. A lot of people don’t realise that. There is no 
				substitute to hard work. That is the key. Life will try to beat 
				you down but you should know how to get up.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you briefly elaborate on your career progression?<br>
				</b>Way back in my college days in 2002 at the Northern Arizona 
				University in the US where I studied for my bachelor’s of 
				science in hotel restaurant management, I worked as a bus boy/ 
				waiter/ bartender. After returning to Oman, I joined the Al 
				Bustan Palace InterContinental Hotel as assistant banquet and 
				conference manager. Then I progressed to become the restaurant 
				manager at the Beach Pavilion Restaurant, Pool bar &amp; Garden 
				service and was later the assistant banquet and conference 
				manager for two years till 2007. I quit that and joined Left 
				Bank as its outlet manager and later I got the opportunity at 
				Enhance as a business development manager, retail solutions. 
				Soon one thing led to another and I made an internal shift and 
				was promoted as the GM, human resources, in April 2011.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Banish the watch<br>
				</b><br>
				A focussed approach has helped Abbas Hassan Al Lawati, Manager, 
				Corporate Finance and Advisory, BankMuscat to achieve success
				<br>
				at a young age<br>
				<br>
				<b>You were one of the winners of the NTI BizPro Young Achievers 
				Award 2012. What are the values and attributes that have enabled 
				you to win this coveted accolade?<br>
				</b>I have been raised up with the values of commitment, 
				dedication and responsibility. If you look at your watch while 
				working then your career progression will suffer. I believe that 
				there are certain key areas that people should develop in order 
				to grow. The first amongst them is learning. This should be a 
				continuous process. Learning can be either theoretical or 
				practical. I completed my CFA, which strengthened my theoretical 
				knowledge. Simultaneously, I have also enhanced my job skills by 
				observing my seniors and doing soft skill courses. <br>
				<br>
				The second prerequisite for success is to be a people’s person. 
				You may be strong and talented, but if you are bounded by your 
				own bubble, the chances are that your success will be limited as 
				the market is all about interaction and team work. I have worked 
				on improving my inter personal skills. In my family and 
				department they call me Dr Phil, after the famous talk show host 
				Phil McGraw, who guides people to solutions. <br>
				<br>
				Thirdly, if you have been given a responsibility, you should 
				finish it and prove that you can do it regardless of constraints 
				like work pressure and time. I also believe that if a person 
				does not want to achieve anything in life, then his life is 
				useless. You need to challenge yourself and do something that is 
				different from others. Achievements give you personal 
				satisfaction and recognition. I am the second Omani in 
				BankMuscat to do a CFA.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you give us a brief on your educational and professional 
				background?</b><br>
				I studied at the American University in Sharjah with a 
				specialisation in accounting and finance. After completing the 
				course I joined BankMuscat in February 2006 as an associate in 
				the corporate finance department. The nature of our job 
				(department) is such that one cannot work on an 8.00am - 3.00pm 
				schedule, one has to be there based on the demands of the 
				assignment on hand. I have learnt this and this has enabled me 
				to shoulder more responsibilities and do well. <br>
				<br>
				You have achieved a lot in a short span of time. What are your 
				future plans and aspirations? <br>
				I want to contribute to the country by transferring my skills, 
				knowledge and experience to the younger generation of Omanis. 
				This can be done through various means like giving lectures, 
				participating in seminars etc. Every young Omani needs to have a 
				good education, commitment, hardwork, and they need to feel that 
				they are working for their own benefit and the betterment of the 
				country. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Are there people who have influenced you or helped you by 
				being your role models? <br>
				</b>It’s important to have a mentor in your mind. If you see 
				your superiors you can learn the traits that have enabled them 
				to reach there. My mother is the person who has built my base in 
				life. On the first day of my job she said, “Don’t look at your 
				watch, once you get into the office just focus on completing 
				your work.” <br>
				<br>
				<b>You are a role model for young Omanis, what advice would you 
				give to the youth of the country? <br>
				</b>Explore what you are good at and once you have figured it 
				out then focus on achieving it with full dedication, commitment 
				and hardwork.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Achiever par excellence<br>
				</b><br>
				Suad Al Balushi, Manager, Treasury Support, Treasury and Capital 
				Markets, BankMuscat has a number of firsts to her credit, and is 
				determined to continue her pursuit of excellence<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you give us a brief on your educational and professional 
				background?<br>
				</b>I started my career in BankMuscat in 2005. I graduated from 
				Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) with a bachelor’s degree in 
				finance with honours. I was also in the dean’s list for three 
				years; you make it to the dean’s list if you get a CGPA of 3.5 
				and above out of four. I joined the treasury department of the 
				bank as officer treasury and started working on getting an ACI 
				certification. I am the first Omani lady-and probably the first 
				lady in the GCC- to complete an ACI certification. I also did an 
				MBA from SQU and graduated last year with distinction and 
				honours.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You made it to the top five of the NTI BizPro Awards 2012, 
				which reflects your success at a young age. What are the 
				attributes and values that have enabled you to do well?<br>
				</b>Learning is something that inspires me. In whatever field 
				that I am in, I want to be the first one who is professionally 
				competent. For example, I had decided that once I graduate I 
				will start working on getting my professional certificate in 
				finance. I am currently pursuing my CFA. I am good at dealing 
				with numbers. While doing my degree course I did my internship 
				at the Central Bank of Oman, where I worked in various 
				departments, and there itself I had decided that if I got a 
				chance to work in a bank, I would like to join its treasury 
				department. When I joined the bank I was not aware of what an 
				ACI certification is but my manager supported me a lot. He told 
				me that since no one else has done this I should get an ACI 
				certificate in the first year itself. Getting an ACI helped me 
				to get recognised at a very early stage of my career in the 
				bank. I have been involved with various initiatives in the bank 
				– for example, I was a member of a the core committee of a new 
				group called BM Minds, which used to organise knowledge quizzes, 
				lectures etc. I am now a part of the BankMuscat IMD initiative. 
				My father has been another big influence in my life. He asks me 
				never to stop learning, and even now he is advising me to do my 
				PhD. Whenever I get a certificate, he is the first person whom I 
				go and show it to. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Having been through the NTI BizPro programme, what are your 
				thoughts on these awards and its role in fostering Omani talent?
				<br>
				</b>This is the first time that I heard about the NTI BizPro 
				Awards. I was not aware of this programme, but once I was 
				nominated by the bank and went through the process I found it to 
				be a tremendous and wonderful initiative. The programme 
				encourages young Omanis to be role model for others. It has also 
				been a good learning process.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How do you spend your spare time, are there certain hobbies 
				that you pursue?<br>
				</b>I am into painting and used to play table tennis. At SQU I 
				won a gold medal in table tennis at the sports day of the 
				College of Commerce and Economics. I have been interested in 
				painting since my school days and have represented my schools in 
				various inter-school painting competitions.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You are a role model for young Omanis, what advice would you 
				give to the youth of the country? <br>
				</b>We are a growing and young country. To build the nation it 
				is essential that we foster education and knowledge. Young 
				Omanis should acquire more professional certificates so that 
				they can compete in the global market.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Change and adapt<br>
				</b><br>
				Hard work and determination are two important requisites to 
				progress in one’s career, says Nabil Saif Al Jasri, Finance 
				Manager, OMRAN<br>
				<br>
				<b>Please give a brief description about yourself<br>
				</b>I am 34 years old and currently working as finance manager 
				with OMRAN (Oman Tourism Development Company). I completed my 
				graduation at the Sultan Qaboos University and did an MSc in 
				finance from the University of Strathclyde. My first job was 
				with BankMuscat as assistant manager – audit and was with them 
				for five years till 2005. During this period I completed my 
				master’s. Later I worked with HSBC and Oman Refineries and 
				Petrochemicals Company; and I joined OMRAN in June, 2011. 
				Through my career, I faced a number of challenges and I have 
				learnt that working as a team is very crucial and more 
				importantly I discovered that motivating the team is also 
				essential.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What was your experience with the NTI BizPro Young Achievers 
				Awards 2012?<br>
				</b>I have been selected among the top five of the NTI BizPro 
				Young Achievers Awards and it has been a completely rewarding 
				experience. It was an intense selection process which brought 
				out the best in me. The tests which were conducted as part of 
				the interview to select the top 10 gave me confidence to believe 
				in my capabilities. More than anything else, it was a 
				personality test for myself as they grilled us to know what kind 
				of knowledge depth we have. <br>
				As part of the tests, our logical thinking ability and how 
				updated we are on current affairs as well as our mathematical 
				skills were examined. In the second round, it was about our 
				managerial skills to check how we react to different situations. 
				Finally, there was a group discussion and an interview to see 
				how we can solve problems at work place.<br>
				<br>
				Before NTI BizPro, I didn’t have any inkling about my own 
				capabilities but now I have emerged stronger and I feel that I 
				can handle pressure and work in any field or industry.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You have risen up the ranks by your hard work and 
				determination. What is your message to your peers and the youth 
				of the country?<br>
				</b>I can say that only by sheer dint of hard work and 
				determination, one can achieve success. Ultimately, its all 
				about changing and adapting to situations. One cannot stay still 
				while the world around you is changing. Another thing is, our 
				youth need to, first of all, attain the right qualification and 
				exposure and then get the required experience to succeed in 
				life. Because I believe that in our country, all of us are equal 
				and everyone has an opportunity to become big if you want to. 
				You just need to motivate yourself and get the right attitude 
				for the job.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What are your plans for the future?<br>
				</b>I plan to go for a leadership training programme and 
				complete my certified management accountant (CMA) course. This 
				will give a further boost to my career and eventually, I hope 
				that I will be able to become a CFO.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Patience pays<br>
				</b><br>
				Nawaf Al Shahwarzi, Assistant Sales Manager, Al Bustan Palace - 
				A Ritz-Carlton Hotel has cultivated the right attitude to excel 
				in his chosen field<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made you chose the hospitality industry and what are the 
				challenges that this sector throws up for young executives?<br>
				</b>I joined the hospitality industry because it is a promising 
				one. One day we may run out of oil and there will be a need to 
				look at other sectors. The government is trying to promote 
				tourism in a big way and the outlook of the hospitality industry 
				looks really good. I see this as a good long-term career choice. 
				Hospitality is an attitude, you need to be at your best 
				behaviour while dealing with customers, so attitude is a big 
				part of getting the job right. Despite its challenges, I am 
				enjoying what I am doing. I have had a number of offers from 
				other industries, but being in a hotel is an everyday challenge 
				and I live that adventure.<br>
				You made it to the Top ten of the NTI BizPro Awards 2012, which 
				reflects your success at a young age. <br>
				<br>
				Having been through the NTI BizPro programme, what are your 
				thoughts on these awards? <br>
				I am really impressed by the NTI BizPro competition. It is a 
				challenging programme which strives to find the next generation 
				of young achievers or leaders of the future. It creates 
				awareness amongst the youth about working hard and looking up to 
				the future. Some of the analytical tests during the programme 
				taught me a lot and showed me the areas that I need to improve 
				upon.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Are there people who have influenced you or helped you by 
				being your role models? <br>
				</b>When I joined the hotel back in 2009, Al Bustan was run by 
				the Intercontinental Group. One of my general managers, Martin 
				Van Kam told me that he saw potential in me and gave me the 
				enthusiasm to go on with my hospitality programme. Van Kam asked 
				me once, “What do you want to be”? I replied, “I want to be a 
				manager.” Then he said, “No, you want to work on being a 
				manager.” This showed me that one has to work hard and grow 
				towards a managerial position. These simple words really 
				inspired me and he remains a role model for me. My father has 
				been my biggest support in my life; he told me about the 
				hospitality programme and encouraged me a lot. He has made all 
				my dreams come true.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you give us a brief on your educational and professional 
				background?<br>
				</b>I started working in Al Bustan Palace in June 2011 after 
				obtaining a diploma in hospitality from the Gilion Institute of 
				Hospitality, Switzerland. I did my first internship in this 
				hotel in 2009, I also did another internship in Montreal, Canada 
				at the Novotel Hotel. I joined the hotel as a sales executive 
				and I am handling government sales, banking and the public 
				authorities. I got promoted as the assistant sales manager in 
				January this year and that was a nice boost and recognition. 
				After doing my high school diploma from the Royal Guard 
				Technical College I worked with Gulf Air for two years in the 
				customer service division.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How do you spend your spare time? Are there certain hobbies 
				that you pursue?<br>
				</b>I had a weight problem as I used to weigh 180kgs. I lost 40 
				kgs within six months by regular exercise and following strict 
				diet regimen. Now it has become a daily habit; after work, I go 
				to the beach with my dog and walk for almost one hour. I now 
				weigh 138kgs and hope to bring it down further.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You are a role model for young Omanis, what advice would you 
				give to the youth of the country? <br>
				</b>My advice for them is simple: be patient. You need to start 
				from bottom and then improve yourself and grow. Secondly, 
				develop the right attitude and do not be judgemental or react 
				emotionally.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Build a strong foundation<br>
				</b><br>
				Ali Al-Mandhari, Manager-Change Management, Operations 
				Department, BankMuscat believes that his success is a result of 
				unwavering dedication and passion<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you give us a brief on your educational and professional 
				background?<br>
				</b>I started with BankMuscat in1998 as a trainee, and have 
				worked with the bank for 14 years. While working with the bank, 
				I completed my bachelor’s degree in banking, finance and 
				international trade from Victoria University, Melbourne, 
				Australia. I came back and joined as a senior staff. In 2005 I 
				went again to Melbourne to do my master’s in business and 
				finance with a specialisation in financial risk management. I 
				came back in 2006 and was posted as an assistant manager in the 
				central operations department. In 2008, I moved to my new 
				department which is change management. In this capacity I am 
				involved with process re-engineering in the organisation. In 
				2011 I got promoted as a manager. <br>
				<br>
				<b>You made it to the Top 10 of the NTI BizPro Awards. What has 
				enabled you to do well at a young age ?<br>
				</b>It is the result of my dedication and passion towards my 
				work. Banking runs in my family as my father worked in Grindlays 
				Bank as a manager and he has always been my role model. At 
				BankMuscat, I like the challenge that comes your way on a daily 
				basis. This helps one to learn and grow all the time. You can 
				learn a particular process, but the changes in a system or the 
				regulatory framework keep one on one’s toes. I believe that 
				one’s learning curve should never stop.<br>
				<br>
				<b>We find a number of young Omanis shifting jobs every few 
				years. What has made you work at BankMuscat for 14 years? <br>
				</b>The opportunities and challenges that BankMuscat offers is 
				unique. Our customer base, branch network and market share is 
				the largest in Oman and this ensures that one has a larger 
				canvas to operate on. The culture of the bank and the leadership 
				of the bank is admirable. We look upto the senior management and 
				want to be like them in future. Moreover, the bank facilitates 
				your growth, it encourage us to train ourselves and we have some 
				of the best trainers from around the world coming and educating 
				us about leadership, team work, project management etc. building 
				our expertise.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How do you spend your spare time, are there certain hobbies 
				that you pursue? <br>
				</b>I am into photography and combine it with my other hobby 
				which is trekking. I do a lot of trekking with my colleagues in 
				the bank. Photography is something that I have been passionate 
				about for a while, but to get the right equipment and cameras 
				took some time. I like nature photography and portraits, but the 
				latter is specifically for family members. Trekking is a part of 
				BankMuscat’s staff engagement programme. The programme started 
				in 2011 and we trek under the guidance of Hamad al Harthy, the 
				ace mountaineer who has scaled Kilimanjaro. We trek in different 
				locations, for example, we went to Jebel Akhdar and trekked for 
				around 30 kms over seven hours. We also did Jebel Shams, at 
				times we trek along the Baushar mountains for three to four 
				hours. I also like to read books about technology, photography, 
				leadership and managing teams. <br>
				<br>
				<b>You are a role model for young Omanis, what advice would you 
				give to the youth of the country? <br>
				</b>My advice to youngsters is that they should take it easy and 
				not rush into things. Build a solid foundation, gain knowledge 
				and experience gradually and surely but steadily you will reach 
				where you want to be.<br>
				<br>
				<b>No free lunch in life<br>
				</b><br>
				Mohammed Abdullah Al Shukaili, Manager, Billing &amp; Operations 
				Support, Customer Care – CBU, Omantel has faced numerous 
				challenges in his job which have helped him emerge as a strong 
				leader<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you talk about your career progression?<br>
				</b>After my high school in Oman, I got a scholarship to Canada 
				where I graduated in software engineering and computer science 
				in 2002. My first work experience was with Omantel as a software 
				programmer in the billing system which is the main part of any 
				telecom company. After six years as a software programmer, I 
				found out an internal vacancy for a manager in the billing and 
				operations department. I applied for that and got it. It was a 
				big move and I soon discovered that there was another part to me 
				which I had never discovered. But actually it was a challenge. 
				Earlier, I did not have a team but now I had to assume a 
				leadership role as I had around 13 people around me. It took 
				time but I managed to handle the responsibility in a worthy 
				manner.<br>
				<br>
				During my years of study in school, I used to be an active 
				member in radio and broadcast group where I had to present the 
				daily programme in front of the students and also among the 
				press reporters, other groups and voluntary workers, and I also 
				did workshops which helped me in building self confidence and 
				creativity skills.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What kind of projects did you handle in Omantel, especially 
				after becoming the manager for billing and operations support 
				unit?</b><br>
				Working in the billing system gave me a rich experience and I 
				worked on various projects like Blackberry services, number 
				portability and was the project technical leader many times. 
				After I became the manager for billing and operations, my first 
				big project was the bill payment machines. This was good for me 
				because it allowed me to interact with vendors, logistics and 
				the installation departments. We have presently 63 of those 
				machines across the country installed within a span of two 
				years.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is the next step for you?<br>
				</b>The billing and operations is the most vital department and 
				I have been in this for almost nine years. Now, I want to add 
				some marketing skills into my portfolio. Then when I achieve 
				that, I will be able to fill up any leadership shoes because by 
				then I will have experience in all aspects of a telecom company. 
				Just having titles and a nice salary is not enough but your 
				career progression should happen when you have the right 
				experience; then only can you fulfill your responsibilities 
				properly.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Who was your role model?<br>
				</b>My father who retired after working in Schlumberger is my 
				greatest role model. He was the one who taught me to work hard 
				and accept the challenges that life throws at me. And my message 
				to Omani youth is that there are no free lunches in life. Work 
				hard initially, and learn as much as you can, and once you gain 
				experience then you can work smart.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ambitious achiever<br>
				</b><br>
				Saud Ahmed Al Shezawi, Regional Manager, Sohar, Oman Oil 
				Marketing Co was quick off the block to maximise on the 
				management’s continuous support and encouragement<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you talk about your career progression and how you became 
				the Sohar regional manager for Oman Oil Marketing Co?<br>
				</b>I completed my bachelor’s in business administration (BBA) 
				in management information systems from the California State 
				University in 2004 and worked for Gulf Stone Company as a senior 
				sales marketing and sales executive for one year. Then I joined 
				Oman Oil Marketing company as fuel cards business manager in 
				2005. From there on I climbed many positions and became the 
				regional manager thanks to the encouragement from my mother and 
				especially my siblings who are all in well to do jobs in various 
				companies. One of them is a journalist with Al Shabiba as well. 
				I could say that I had an ambition and drive to be at the top 
				and not settle for anything less. I now manage the whole 
				business for my company from Sohar, covering Suwaiq, Buraimi all 
				the way up to Musandam. I am looking after the logistics, sales 
				and the filling stations business. All this is possible only due 
				to my company which has been very supportive of me.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is your opinion about NTI Biz Pro Awards?<br>
				</b>This is something unique for our country. As you know, 
				usually, we get recognition for excellence only in schools and 
				colleges but competing against peers and contemporaries from 
				other companies who excel in their fields is something good. I 
				feel it is an interesting challenge and an opportunity to learn 
				and shape our skills while learning from the experiences of 
				others.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How do you view yourself in the next five years?<br>
				</b>I want to learn more. I want to grow more and attain a 
				senior position. And I know that this is possible because my 
				company has a very encouraging environment. Our senior 
				management has given us independent responsibilities which 
				enables us to take decisions and face any new challenges and 
				execute the required tasks. We also constantly learn from our 
				seniors. It’s a totally vibrant culture and I could say that we 
				have a very youthful culture which encourages the staff to excel 
				in their roles.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is your message to the youth of the country?<br>
				</b>I would urge them to take the opportunities and excel in 
				your job. The most important skill essential for young Omanis to 
				do well in life is the ability to learn things quickly and apply 
				what you learn in your life. Everyone should aim to have strong 
				communication, planning, implementation/execution skills, as 
				these are important to succeed in a challenging business 
				environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What are your achievements in your career?<br>
				</b>During my five years at the California State University, I 
				got a number of awards as the best student. I was among the top 
				three per cent of graduates and received the Magna Cum Laude 
				Certificate and was judged as being amongst the top five per 
				cent in the business school of the university. I got the ‘Best 
				achievement in collection’ award in 2007 in my company and was 
				also named as ‘Manager of the year’ in 2008. While studying at 
				the Sohar Secondary School, I had scored high marks in all 
				subjects paving the way for me to bag a fully funded Ministry of 
				Higher Education scholarship for further studies abroad.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Knowledge is important<br>
				</b><br>
				Wherever you can get knowledge, go for it and you should not be 
				afraid of challenges if you see a career and success in it, says 
				Ali Ahmed Mohsin Al Lawati, Senior Manager – Senior Dealer, 
				Global Treasury, National Bank of Oman<br>
				<br>
				<b>You are working in the treasury department which is a risky 
				area. How challenging has been it for you?<br>
				</b>If you look at my career, I actually studied to become an 
				electromechanical engineer. But after my graduation from the Al 
				Khuwair Technical College in 1996, I did not get any good offer. 
				So I joined the National Bank of Oman (NBO) in the operations 
				department in the year 2000. Then I found the job very 
				interesting and did my CAT (Certified Accounting Technician) 
				from the then Banking and Finance Institute which is now become 
				the College of Banking and Finance. At that time, they had a 
				tie-up with the Arab Academy in Jordan. I also would like to 
				acknowledge that I have the support of my department head 
				Manjith Wadhwa who has been encouraging me ever since I joined.<br>
				<br>
				On the career front, I moved from the operations to the back 
				office of the treasury department after three years. I manage 
				the interbank forex and money market which I learnt in the bank 
				itself. This is an area which everybody cannot undertake because 
				of the risk involved. I deal with banks mainly in Europe. It was 
				a great opportunity and a great challenge because there is so 
				much risk in buying currency, buying and selling money which 
				runs into millions. I joined as a dealer, and in 2009 I became a 
				senior dealer as a functional title.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You are enjoying your job presently. Where do you see 
				yourself in the next five years?<br>
				</b>The next thing for me is to be the chief dealer before 
				thinking of any other position. Because each level has its own 
				experience and leadership skills. Ultimately, it is about 
				managing people and that is very important.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is your opinion about NTI BizPro Awards?<br>
				</b>It is a good way to find the leaders in the market, the 
				future leaders actually. And from the interview and the tests 
				that are conducted, you can figure out what they are doing 
				currently and where they will be reaching in five to ten years. 
				They were also looking at our reactions when they question us. 
				For example, during my interview round, they informed that two 
				of my colleagues had complained against me. But I was confident 
				that they would not, however, they insisted that it was true. 
				Then finally, I was told that they wanted to check my reaction 
				to such a situation. It was really good as it was a way of 
				knowing your character.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is your message to the next generation?<br>
				</b>Always think about your studies because knowledge is 
				important. In terms of opportunities, you should think twice 
				before saying no. Self motivation also is important. Further, I 
				think our youth should make reading as their main hobby. Another 
				view of mine is that young Omanis should invest in housing which 
				is more important than having a fancy car or flashy mobile 
				phones. They can pay the rent money as EMIs for a housing loan.</td>

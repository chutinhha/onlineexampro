						The Sultanate of Oman is among the top 15 countries of 
						the world that have the world’s highest per capita 
						environmental footprint, according to a recent report by 
						the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The Living Planet 
						report, conducted with the Global Footprint Network and 
						the Zoological Society of London, puts the Omani per 
						capita environmental footprint higher than 140 countries 
						in the world.<br>
						<br>
						The other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in 
						the top 15 include Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE. Oman is at 
						the 14th position globally. <br>
						<br>
						The Living Planet Report measures humanity’s need for 
						natural resources such as land for crops and grazing, 
						fishing area, forests and others against the planet’s 
						ability to produce these resources. Although Oman’s 
						total environmental footprint is well below one per cent 
						of that of the rest of the world, its per capita 
						footprint, which is close to six global hectares (gha) 
						per person, is much higher than the global average.<br>
						<br>
						<b>So what is the significance of this ecological 
						footprint for Oman?<br>
						</b>Scientists have long measured human demand on the 
						Earth’s ecosystems versus its capacity to regenerate: 
						this equation is called an ecological footprint. A 
						carbon footprint is a subset of this ecological 
						footprint, and is simply a conceptual measure of the 
						impact individual human activities have on the 
						environment.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Climate change<br>
						</b>The term carbon footprint owes its origins to the 
						idea that a footprint is what has been left behind as a 
						result of individual or industrial activities. On an 
						individual level, you contribute through burning fossil 
						fuels by heating and supplying your home or business 
						with electricity and through the modes of personal 
						transportation that you choose. In industrial or 
						commercial applications, a carbon footprint includes the 
						total carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases which 
						cumulatively are known as green house gases (GHGs) 
						accumulated over the full life cycle of a product or 
						service.<br>

						<br>
						The GHGs are responsible for climate change and the 
						subsequent global warming. According to a report by 
						Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y), climate change presents a new and 
						real threat of severe environmental, economic, political 
						and security impacts in the Middle East &amp; North Africa 
						(MENA) region. For a region that is already vulnerable 
						to many non-climate stresses, climate change is more 
						likely to increase this vulnerability.<br>
						<br>
						On a global scale, climate change is not only a serious 
						and growing threat to the environment and human health, 
						but also to economic systems. Worldwide economic losses 
						from natural disasters appear to be doubling every 
						decade and if the current trends persist, annual 
						economic losses will reach almost $150bn in the next 
						decade.<br>
						<br>
						The effects of global warming are alarming to say the 
						least. There has been increase in average atmospheric 
						temperature which is expected to go up by 1-40C in the 
						next 100 years. A rise in temperatures will lead to 
						higher sea levels inundating low lying countries. Some 
						of the other effects are abrupt weather changes, more 
						frequent and intense heat waves and tropical cyclones, 
						more floods, fast melting of ice at Arctic and Antarctic 
						regions etc.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Business opportunity<br>
						</b>The scenario seems to be bleak but there is always 
						hope if action can be initiated today. However, in the 
						corporate world which is increasingly facing topline and 
						bottomline pressures due to global financial 
						uncertainty, making profits seems to be the most 
						pressing matter as compared to worrying about climate 
						change and global warming.<br>
						<br>
						But how would it sound, if someone told you that doing 
						something about climate change can bring your company 
						much needed savings and revenues? Yes, this is true and 
						possible. And there are two ways of doing this.<br>
						<br>
						The first and the easiest is by leveraging climate 
						change risk as a competitive advantage by launching 
						ambitious carbon footprint reduction initiatives and the 
						second way is by implementing the clean developing 
						mechanism popularly known as carbon trading.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
						Companies in Oman can earn carbon credits for their 
						emissions reductions. These credits can then be sold to 
						companies in developed countries as per the Kyoto 
						Protocol so that the companies in developed countries 
						can remain within their carbon emissions targets. This 
						process is known as carbon trading.<br>
						<br>
						The value that a company can get through the carbon 
						credit scheme per year is such that within four or five 
						years a business can earn money which could run into 
						millions of dollars, which is not small money. That is 
						very attractive.<br>
						<br>
						According to Rajeev Singh, partner, transaction advisory 
						services, Ernst &amp; Young, Oman, “there are two potential 
						sets of clients for whom something like carbon trading 
						becomes useful. One is for those who want to be good 
						corporate citizens. They say, OK we want to measure what 
						is our own carbon footprint as an organisation and see 
						how we can reduce it and what are the best practices 
						around the world.” <br>
						<br>
						“There are some other companies which get attracted by 
						the commercial proposition highlighted by the value of 
						the carbon credit scheme. A borderline business case can 
						suddenly become commercially feasible with the help of 
						an earlier unexplored revenue stream, which is 
						significant. So the key issue is that if you can add a 
						few hundred thousand dollars every year for the next 7 - 
						10 years, I don’t think any CEO can afford to overlook 
						that. In this case, you may be taking a commercial 
						decision and incidentally you also become a good 
						corporate citizen,” adds Singh.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Ambitious initiatives<br>
						</b>Companies in Oman are slowly understanding the need 
						to reduce the GHG emissions and they are working towards 
						it. For, by leveraging climate change risk as a 
						competitive advantage and launching ambitious low carbon 
						initiatives and addressing GHG emissions, companies can 
						identify opportunities to bolster their bottomline, 
						reduce risk, and discover competitive advantages.<br>
						<br>
						This begins by determining their liability to climate 
						change regulations by measuring the carbon footprint of 
						their business processes/products. An effective 
						corporate climate change strategy requires a detailed 
						understanding of a company’s GHG impact.<br>
						<br>
						OCTAL Petrochemicals, the largest PET sheet producer and 
						integrated packaging company in the world operating from 
						Salalah, is setting critical global industry benchmarks 
						in energy and natural resource efficiency and 
						improvement in mechanical properties. The company’s 
						state-of-the-art PET complex in the Salalah Free Zone 
						was purposely designed and built to yield superior 
						quality products with waste and cost reduction benefits, 
						increased productivity for thermoformers and unmatched 
						environmental advantages.<br>
						<br>
						Says Nicholas P Barakat, managing director, OCTAL, “To 
						date, the company has invested more than $600mn in 
						environmental sustainability for the deployment of 
						ground-breaking technology and propriety production 
						methods to produce PET resin and PET sheet with the 
						lowest carbon footprint in the world. We have 
						successfully eliminated five energy-intensive stages of 
						the conventional sheet production process, reducing 67 
						per cent of energy consumption. With the entire energy 
						requirements derived from clean combustion natural gas, 
						the specially adapted burners consume up to 20 per cent 
						less gas. As a result, the company’s PET sheet, DPET, 
						boasts 25 per cent lower carbon footprint than 
						conventional APET as confirmed by Renewable Choice 
						Energy and Intertek Expert Services. The reduction per 
						tonne is equivalent to driving 4,135km in an average 
						passenger vehicle.”<br>
						<br>
						Such revolutionary technologies have been noticed by 
						global companies which themselves are implementing 
						greener processes and this has enabled the Oman-based 
						OCTAL to bag manufacturing orders from all across the 
						world.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Reducing emissions<br>
						</b>“At the moment, we at E&amp;Y are working with Haya 
						Water to calculate the emissions they are reducing 
						through their sludge composting project. Haya water has 
						set up a composting plant to prevent methane (a 
						greenhouse gas) from being emitted into the atmosphere, 
						therefore reducing Haya Water’s carbon emissions,” says 
						Velika Talyarkhan, consultant, climate change &amp; 
						sustainability services, E&amp;Y Oman.<br>
&nbsp;</font><p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">
						<b>
						<font face="Verdana" size="2">
                		<img border="0" src="images/environment-june-12-3.jpg" width="500" height="333"></font></b><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
						<font face="Verdana" size="1">
						<br>
						What Haya is doing with the composting project, Kala is 
						that they are reducing the methane emissions by 
						aerobically composting the sewage sludge. So instead of 
						sending the sludge to a landfill which could cause 
						methane emissions, Haya is composting it and making a 
						good product which can be sold in Oman itself. In doing 
						so they are reducing their carbon emissions.<br>
						<br>
						“We have also supported Port of Salalah in measuring 
						their carbon footprint and now we are working with 
						another company to implement their environment 
						management system which will also help in carbon 
						footprint reduction and could in the future lead to 
						carbon trading,” Velika adds. <br>
						<br>
						Companies in developing countries, like Oman, can sell 
						carbon credits to companies in developed nations, 
						including European countries, who have emissions 
						reductions targets to meet. It is cheaper for the 
						developed nations to buy the carbon credits than to pay 
						the penalty for not meeting the target. Instead of 
						trying to bring new technologies to bring down their 
						emissions, which will be really expensive, it is cheaper 
						for developed nations to invest in a developing 
						country’s projects carbon reduction project. <br>
						<br>
						So in the specific case of Haya, the greenhouse gas they 
						are reducing is methane (CH4) and that actually has a 
						much larger global warming potential than carbon dioxide 
						as it is 21 times more harmful than CO2 and more 
						damaging to the environment.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Carbon management<br>
						</b>Global mining giant Vale, which has its pelletising 
						plant in Sohar, has invested $40mn in technologies to 
						reduce its Oman project’s environmental impact, such as 
						electrostatic precipitators and a wind fence to control 
						particulate matter emissions in Oman. The main source of 
						GHG emission of the plant is during fuel consumption. 
						But the site also has a continuous emissions monitoring 
						system, and 100 per cent of the water used is recycled. 
						“Vale’s very large ore carriers are also designed to 
						reduce carbon emissions by 35 per cent per tonne of ore 
						transported, a green feature that won us the 
						Nor-Shipping Clean Ship Award in May 2011. Periodically, 
						Vale reports to the Omani government about the GHG 
						emissions monitoring and management of its operations,” 
						says Najla Zuhair Al Jamali, head of business and 
						strategic affairs, Vale Oman.<br>
						<br>
						Globally, Vale emitted 16 tons of GHG emissions in 2011. 
						However, Vale Carbon Programme, part of the company’s 
						corporate guidelines on climate change and carbon, has 
						the goal to make Vale a leader in climate change 
						mitigation. The company works conscientiously and is 
						revising its methodology for capital project development 
						to include the use of alternatives to reduce the GHG 
						emissions in projects’ engineering design phase.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Reducing carbon footprint<br>
						</b>Daikin, the air conditioner manufacturing giant, 
						which has a large presence in Oman, is compliant with 
						government of Oman’s directive to reduce the use of 
						hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFCs), which is one of the 
						six major greenhouses gases depleting the ozone layer of 
						the earth’s atmosphere.<br>
						<br>
						Oman is a signatory to the Montreal Protocol on 
						Substances that deplete the ozone layer and the Ministry 
						of Environment and Climate Affairs has issued a 
						notification to avoid installing new air-conditioning 
						systems or equipments containing HCFCs as the procedures 
						for reducing the production and consumption of HCFCs 
						will begin as of January 2013.<br>

						<font face="Verdana" size="2">
                		<img border="0" src="images/environment-june-12-4.jpg" width="500" height="333"></font></b><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
						<font face="Verdana" size="1">
						<br>
						Geeju Paul, senior divisional manager, Muscat 
						Electronics, which is a distributor of Daikin in Oman, 
						says the Daikin Group focuses on reducing both 
						fluorocarbon emissions generated during product 
						manufacture and electricity used during air conditioner 
						use, the major contributors to global warming.<br>
						<br>
						“We strive to reduce environmental impact through the 
						recovery and destruction of fluorocarbons during the 
						processes of production, maintenance, and product 
						disposal. In product development, we are shifting to 
						refrigerant alternatives that do not deplete the ozone 
						layer as we continue to work toward lessening the impact 
						our business has on the environment,” adds Paul.<br>
						<br>
						One of the major technologies which helps reduce 
						Daikin’s footprint is the VRV3 which has a proprietary 
						inverter technology and cutting edge control technology 
						for the refrigerant. The VRV3 air-conditioning system 
						operates with outstanding efficiency and contributes to 
						high energy savings and brings down the carbon footprint 
						of buildings.<br>
						<br>
						In conclusion, as the impact of climate change becomes 
						more frequent and prominent, governments are expected to 
						set new policies and provide additional market-based 
						incentives to drive significant reductions in emissions. 
						Businesses need to start planning for this transition 
						now while they make decisions that will lock in their 
						investments for years to come and more importantly there 
						are many benefits if carbon management strategy is 
						accounted for an early stage.&#8194;</font></td>

				government published by Palgrave Macmillan in March 2011.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You have advised a number of governments like Egypt, UAE and 
				Oman in the region; in what capacity have you worked with these 
				entities?</b><br>
				My area of specialisation is government transformation and 
				effectiveness. I have been called to handle different projects 
				by various government entities to review strategic plans being 
				worked upon by various consultants to ensure smooth 
				implementation. Strategy implementation is more challenging than 
				just coming up with an attractively developed strategy. For 
				example, I was invited by the Abu Dhabi government to work on 
				the implementation of their five-year Strategy Planning and 
				Economic Vision 2030. I was also involved in developing the 
				transformational plan of one of the Abu Dhabi’s government 
				entities in 2007 which entailed not only re-structuring the 
				organisation but also re-defining the role of that entity in 
				order to become a more effective player for building a 
				knowledge-based economy which is the core of vision. We did a 
				benchmarking of that organisation against similar entities from 
				19 countries drawn from the G-7 and other countries which had 
				been successful in their economic transformation and 
				diversification efforts. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Your book titled Leading Smart Transformation – A Roadmap for 
				World Class Government talks about this theme in detail. Can you 
				explain the term Smart Transformation in a nutshell?</b><br>
				The book was published in March 2011 but was written in 2010 and 
				it precedes the recent changes in the Arab World, but even while 
				authoring this book we felt that governments in the region would 
				soon come under pressure to change and transform in order to 
				perform better. The book looks at what it takes to transform a 
				government entity. We look at the key aspects that can drive 
				this change and these are leadership, a transformation programme, 
				and communication. There can be no smart transformation without 
				smart leaders and this remains one of the major challenges in 
				the region. Our research indicates that Leaders should have the 
				ability to envision, translate that vision into a well defined 
				roadmap, and finally communicate that vision and the map to all 
				stakeholders, both internally and externally. These are what we 
				called them in our book the ‘smart enablers of change’.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You also talk about Project Management Office (PMO) as an 
				important component of the transformation process. Why is the 
				PMO so critical to success. <br>
				</b>From research and experience, I can say that there has been 
				so much emphasis in the region on developing strategies, which 
				is very important. However, in my opinion, we tend to over 
				strategise, while the biggest challenge is to transform this 
				strategy into reality. One of the primary purposes of PMO should 
				be to translate the vision, mission, and objectives, into 
				specific well-defined initiatives. Then those initiatives should 
				be monitored for performance. The monitoring should be from an 
				efficiency point of view which sees whether we are utilising the 
				right resources while the effectiveness is measured in terms of 
				whether a particular initiative is having an impact on the core 
				business of the organisation. I was involved in setting up PMO 
				in one of the government organisations. They had 129 initiatives 
				which needed to be carefully monitored for performance.<br>
				<br>
				Usually, the PMO only looks into efficiency – as in whether 
				things are getting done within a stipulated time and the budget, 
				but in that particular project, we added a third dimension which 
				is the link between each of the 129 initiatives and the national 
				vision and this is what a smart PMO should focus on. <br>
				<br>
				<b>You have been associated with some of the best universities 
				and institutes in the world; going by your experience, is it 
				possible to replicate models which were developed in advanced 
				countries in a region like the Middle East or GCC? </b><br>
				There is so much to learn from these models, but the ability to 
				adapt them to the local needs is extremely critical, so while we 
				need to comprehend these models we should also be in a position 
				to adapt these model to the local needs and culture and this is 
				a real challenge. In general, we tend to either reinvent the 
				wheel by not learning from best practices or we try to adopt 
				rather than adapt existing models as they are and both these 
				approaches proved to have serious challenges in terms of 
				effectiveness. <br>
				<br>
				<b>As you mentioned, your book was written before recent events 
				in the region. Given the changed circumstances, are your 
				hypothesis still valid?</b><br>
				The simple answer is definitely yes. Recent events in the region 
				have added a third dimension to the performance equation. Till 
				recently governments were expected to be high performing and 
				this meant being efficient and effective, but now governments 
				need to be not just high performing but also high(ly) 
				responsive. This is something kind of new that governments have 
				to deal with. What is happening now is not an incremental 
				change; it is a major transformation. This requires a serious 
				revisit to the role and contribution of government organisations.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>The public sector with its entrenched bureaucracy is often 
				seen as being inadaptable to change, given this proposition can 
				governments become high responsive?</b><br>
				My simple answer is, yes. Governments can become high responsive 
				and currently I am working on a research titled, ‘High 
				Performing Bureaucracy’ and we have a number of such examples 
				around the world. Norway is one example that comes to mind, 
				Singapore is another. There are a number of elements that a high 
				responsive government needs to have. Among the most important 
				ones is aligning strategy with available capabilities. 
				Unfortunately, I have seen many strategies which were not 
				aligned with national or organisational capabilities, therefore, 
				we end up producing wishlists rather than strategic objectives. 
				Talent is the core of such capabilities. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Talent building has been a major area of discussion lately, 
				does the region have local skill sets that are commensurate to 
				the best or is there a need to do more in terms of education ?</b><br>
				There are two issues here: capacity and capability. Countries 
				within the region differ from one another. Some countries suffer 
				from both capacity and capability shortage, as they neither have 
				enough nationals to implement their vision, nor do they have the 
				right talent to do so. Other countries have the capacity but not 
				the capability. In Oman, I believe that we certainly have the 
				capacity, The issue is whether we have the right capability or 
				even whether we are developing the right one! In general, the 
				biggest challenge in the region is aligning education outcomes 
				with the national agenda. In other words, building the right 
				talent to contribute effectively to the socio-economic 
				development of the country. That is something that needs to be 
				carefully addressed by policy and decision makers of the 
				country. I often get invited to talk about the impact of 
				training and development programmes and how we can measure such 
				an impact.<br>
				<br>
				In my opinion, developing talent is all about developing 
				knowledge, skills, and behaviour. This is not something that can 
				be achieved by a single government entity. Different entities 
				will have to work together in order to develop the right 
				policies, regulations, infrastructure, and programmes – the 
				whole ‘Talent Echo System’. Otherwise, the work will be 
				incomplete and partially ineffective. I am very positive that 
				this can be achieved in Oman since we have a leader who believes 
				in developing the right talent and creating the right 
				opportunity for them as indicated in His Majesty’s recent 
				speech.<br>

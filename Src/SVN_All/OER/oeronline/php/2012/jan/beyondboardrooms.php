					You 
					have interviewed scores of people worldwide, does anyone 
					stand out amongst them?</b><br>
                    The people who stand out and the ones whom you remember are 
					not those with big names or the politicians, but people who 
					have found something special amongst themselves, people who 
					were caught up in extraordinary events, heartrending events 
					sometimes, where they were badly injured or lost someone 
					close to them in terrifying circumstances; but one thing 
					that all of them have in common is that they refused to be 
					victims and it is that refusal to be a victim that gives 
					them strength and brings out the best in them. Those are the 
					ones whom I remember.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Any thoughts on politicians or celebrities that you may 
					have interviewed?</b><br>
                    If I had to spend 24 hours in a room with a politician, I 
					would choose Mikhail Gorbachev – the last leader of the 
					Soviet Union – because he was such an interesting and 
					stimulating man to come out of such a stagnant system. He 
					was a small man who filled a room with his presence. You 
					could really sense his power, authority and a strange kind 
					of warmth. He was a fascinating man and I have never met a 
					politician like him.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You have had a strong association with Hardtalk, the 
					iconic interview show on BBC. How do you look back on the 
					programme?</b><br>
                    &nbsp;Just like so many ideas, it came across as a simple 
					idea of two people sitting opposite each other and talking, 
					but we kept on thinking about doing it differently and we 
					felt that the research, facts and information needed to be 
					the differentiator. We would use robust questioning based on 
					facts to extract something new from the person. The idea was 
					not to beat people up. A lot of people said I was aggressive 
					while doing Hardtalk, but I feel I was not aggressive but 
					tough and there is a fine line dividing the two. I don’t 
					think that one should confuse bad manners with good 
					journalism and I hope that I never did. The idea was never 
					to intimidate people but to put them on the spot and to get 
					answers to vital questions. I always looked at it as a 
					public service.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The Doha Debates is something that is readily recognised 
					in the region and there are a lot of urban legends about how 
					it all started, what is the real story behind the programme?</b><br>
                    I was invited for a lunch with the Emir of Qatar when I went 
					for a conference in 2004, and he asked whether I have any 
					ideas and I said no, but I promised to think about it what 
					we might do in Qatar. I came back with the idea of town hall 
					debates and it went from there. I never thought that The 
					Doha Debates would happen, never thought it would last this 
					long, that some of the results of the debate would be so 
					controversial and I never thought that the people in the 
					region would open up so much. The idea behind the programme 
					is to let young people ask the questions on behalf of those 
					who cannot do so, to get them to get used to participating 
					in the politics of their country and to realise that it is 
					not a right but a duty.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You moderated the Oman Debate and this has been your 
					first full-fledged interaction with an audience here, what 
					are your thoughts on the proceedings?</b><br>
                    I think people were very critical, people are impatient, 
					they want more reform. You give people reform and they want 
					more, you give people rights and they want more and that is 
					what happens. The Oman Debate showed that people have a 
					clear idea of what they don’t like in society, the obstacles 
					to greater prosperity, they want greater interaction and 
					that the government is listening. I was surprised by how 
					open and frank people were and I enjoyed it enormously. <br>

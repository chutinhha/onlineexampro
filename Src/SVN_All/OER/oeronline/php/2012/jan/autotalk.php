				Bentley Motors hosted an exclusive customer drive event at the 
				Yas Marina Forumal One Circuit in Abu Dhabi. Visvas Paul D Karra 
				was a guest along with other journalists at this event where the 
				new Continental GTC, GT, Flying Spur and the ultra luxurious 
				Mulsanne models were put through their paces.<br>
				<br>
				Its one thing to drive the latest Bentley beauties on a Formula 
				One race track but if you get an opportunity to take a ride in 
				the oldest Bentley – the historic Bentley EXP2 – and that too on 
				a Formula One track, then its a dream come true. This exclusive 
				script was complete when we were flown over the Yas Island by 
				helicopter to get a bird’s eye view of the Formula One race 
				track and were later given a preview of the fastest sailing 
				yacht in this part of the world. <br>
				<br>
				This treat of a complete track, sea and air experience at the 
				Bentley drive event is synonymous with the unique lifestyle that 
				the name Bentley evokes. As one of the world’s key exclusive 
				brands, it takes an appreciation of the finest things in life to 
				be able to fully understand the equal parts of strength and 
				subtlety that are contained within Bentley’s exceptional DNA. It 
				all started back in Europe of the 1920s, when a group of wealthy 
				car enthusiasts known as the Bentley Boys set the motoring world 
				alight with their achievements on one of the world’s most famous 
				racetracks, Le Mans. This select group of men, brought together 
				by their combined love of speed and passion for life, believed 
				in one thing alone: that a Bentley was much more than a means of 
				getting from A to B; It was for living life to the full.<br>
				<br>
				Together, the Bentley Boys helped to position Bentley as much 
				more than just a car company: it was synonymous with a premium 
				lifestyle choice. Fast forward over 90 years, and this brand 
				ethos is brought right up to date and is very much apparent at 
				the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. In the world of motorsport, 
				it is hard to beat a Formula 1 racetrack.<br>
				<br>
				Here, Bentley united the founding principles of its gentlemen 
				racers of the ‘Twenties’ to offer Middle East customers and VIPs 
				a taste of luxury travel by road, sea and air. And ensuring that 
				the company’s roots are very much remembered, a surprise guest 
				from 1920, the Bentley EXP2 also made an appearance. The EXP2 is 
				the second car that Bentley Motors founder, WO Bentley ever 
				built. The EXP2 chassis was presented at the 1919 British 
				International Motor Show to high acclaim and one year later 
				developed into the Bentley 3-litre Experimental. The original, 
				EXP1 is no longer in existence, making EXP2 the oldest surviving 
				Bentley. Valued at around RO450,471, it is one of the most 
				expensive Bentleys in the world, not because of its luxurious 
				specifications and personalisations but because of its historic 
				value: the first British Sports Car. <br>
				<br>
				We were able to take a passenger ride in the iconic EXP2 in an 
				experience of old versus new as it travelled along the Yas 
				Island Circuit. Chris Buxton, the host of this 
				once-in-a-lifetime experience, and regional director for Bentley 
				Motors Middle East, Africa and India, explained: “Our customers 
				do not purely buy a luxury car, they buy into the Bentley brand 
				and everything it stands for. Today’s experience, which is 
				uniquely Bentley, gives an opportunity to taste what we are 
				about, and learn about the lifestyle that comes with owning one 
				of our cars. It isn’t every day that you can step off a luxury 
				yacht or out of a helicopter and then blast round the track in a 
				car capable of over 300 kilometres per hour!”<br>
				<br>
				Fresh from the Dubai Motor Show where it made its Middle East 
				debut, the new Continental GTC was the first opportunity to get 
				a real feel for this latest addition to the Bentley line up. In 
				a beautiful hue of Breeze the convertible was available for VIPs 
				and customers to drive on Yas Circuit. The GTC rockets from 0-60 
				in 4.5 seconds thanks to a hand-built 567hp powerplant. Boasting 
				516 lb-ft of torque, and a Quickshift transmission that improves 
				acceleration response times and cuts shift times to an 
				incredible 200 miliseconds. The GTC’s chassis, the stiffest of 
				any convertible in the world, provides a firm foundation for 
				suspension control, minimizing scuttle shake and contributing to 
				the GTC’s refined handling.<br>
				<br>
				The GTC interior features luxurious wood and leather 
				craftsmanship, for which Bentley is renowned, alongside 
				class-leading technology, such as eight-inch touch-screen 
				infotainment system, and zip-code entry navigation, all 
				supported by a 30-gigabyte hard drive. To complete the full 
				Bentley experience we drove the stunning Continental Flying Spur 
				Speed. This sumptuous and spacious four-door Grand Tourer 
				possesses the heart and soul of the most breathtaking 
				high-performance coupé in the world, while at the same time 
				offering enhanced levels of personalisation, comfort and ride 
				quality. Inspired by Bentley’s legendary ‘Speed’ models that 
				first appeared in 1923, the 600 bhp Continental Flying Spur 
				Speed is the most powerful 4-door car ever produced by the 
				British manufacturer. Offering the pure driving experience and 
				uncompromising performance synonymous with all Bentleys bearing 
				the Speed legend, the Flying Spur Speed returns a range of 
				headline performance figures, including a 0-100 km/h sprint time 
				of 4.8 seconds and a top speed of 322 km/h.<br>
				<br>
				With experts on hand to teach us how to get the most from the 
				cars on the Yas Island circuit the next decision was which 
				vehicle to try with the flagship Mulsanne and the GT also 
				available for driving. We got an exclusive opportunity to go for 
				a drive around the Yas Marina circuit in the ultra luxurious 
				Mulsanne, away from the din and roar of the GTs on the race 
				tracks. In one breath, we can say, Mulsanne is luxury 
				personified every inch.</font></td>

				Renaissance subsidiary, Topaz Energy and Marine (Topaz), a

				long term charters, totalling over $65mn, in the GCC and the 
				Caspian Sea, two of the company’s major operating areas. It also 
				confirms the acquisition of Topaz Rayyan and Caspian Reliance, 
				two Anchor Handling Tug Supply Vessel (AHTS). Topaz Rayyan will 
				be deployed in Qatar on a seven-year, $50mn charter, for an 
				international oil company. The vessel was built in 2006 and was 
				previously owned by Sanko Steamship Co in Japan. The second 
				AHTS, Caspian Reliance, is to be deployed in the Caspian Sea 
				with a firm contract value of $13.9mn. It is a new, untraded 
				vessel formerly owned by Boluda. The vessels are 100-T DP-2 
				Anchor Handling Tug Supply Vessels (AHTS) and both will undergo 
				a $2mn upgrade to meet client-specific requirements. Advanced 
				DP-2 is a standard required increasingly by IOCs, which allows 
				vessels to remain accurately in position for long durations. Roy 
				Donaldson, COO of Topaz Marine &amp; Energy says, “The addition of 
				these two vessels increases the number of more technologically 
				advanced DP-2 vessels in our fleet. Our strategic focus on 
				modern technology ensures our vessels meet the standards 
				required increasingly by our international oil clients. These 
				acquisitions ensure that Topaz’s fleet remains one of the 
				youngest.”</td>

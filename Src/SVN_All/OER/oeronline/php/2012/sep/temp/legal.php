				<br>
				The Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials 
				in International Business Transactions came into effect in early 
				1999. It was issued by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation 
				and Development (OECD) which is an intergovernmental 
				organisation grouping 30 countries. Parties to the OECD 
				Anti-Bribery Convention are committed to combating the payment 
				of bribes by their nationals (individuals and companies) to 
				foreign public officials, including to officials in countries 
				which are not a party to the Anti-Bribery Convention.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Standards to fight bribery<br>
				</b>Parties to the Convention have made bribing of foreign 
				public officials in international business a criminal offence. 
				As the convention is not self-executing, an enforcing law is 
				required. This means each country transposes the agreed 
				standards in line with its own legal tradition. The convention’s 
				most significant provisions require parties to:<br>
				Criminalise bribery of foreign public officials in international 
				business transactions <br>
				Provide a definition of a “foreign public official” <br>
				<br>
				Set accounting and auditing standards for prohibiting the use of 
				accounting documents for bribing.<br>
				<br>
				The OECD Anti-Bribery Convention is complemented by a set of 
				OECD recommendations which set forth general provisions aimed at 
				deterring, preventing and combating international bribery. 
				Countries are for instance advised to establish transparency in 
				book-keeping and auditing practices, encourage the adoption of 
				internal company controls as well as sound procurement rules and 
				practices.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Practical Impacts of the Convention<br>
				</b>The regulatory changes have important consequences. 
				Companies may be prosecuted in multiple jurisdictions, chief 
				executives may face extradition and onerous fines can be 
				imposed.<br>
				<br>
				The following example is an illustration of a case which was 
				handled by more than one jurisdiction. Norway fined its state 
				oil company an equivalent of over $3mn in 2004 for paying bribes 
				to an Iranian government official to obtain a contract to 
				develop the South Pars gas field in Iran. After that, the 
				Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US began its own 
				investigation and fined the company over $10mn in addition to 
				forcing it to disgorge a further US $ 10 million of profits and 
				undergo a compliance review.<br>
				<br>
				Businesses, their associations and industry federations are 
				making valuable contributions to promoting best practices. These 
				actors play a fundamental role in developing and enforcing 
				preventive, self-regulatory measures to eliminate malpractices 
				and fraud. Over the last decade, a wide range of self-regulatory 
				tools have been elaborated. Business tools to raise awareness 
				and prevent malpractice include:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Codes of conduct<br>
				</b>Compliance programmes to ensure that the values of the 
				company are strongly supported by top management, staff members 
				are trained and educated, guidance exists for situations 
				requiring judgment, and effective information and reporting 
				systems are established by the company.<br>
				<br>
				Integrity pacts are a tool developed in the 1990s to help 
				governments and businesses fight corruption in the field of 
				public contracting. An integrity pact establishes mutual 
				contractual rights and obligations to reduce the high cost of 
				corruption in public contracting.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The UN Convention Against Corruption<br>
				</b>The OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and the UNCAC (United 
				Nations Convention Against Corruption) are complementary, and 
				both provide opportunities for international cooperation in this 
				regard. The UNCAC is the latest and broadest anti-corruption 
				convention. With about 70 articles, the Convention provides a 
				comprehensive framework encompassing prevention and prosecution 
				of corruption. The UNCAC has the widest geographical coverage of 
				all international anti-corruption instruments. According to the 
				UN website, 140 countries are signatories and 107 have ratified 
				it (in early 2008).<br>
				<br>
				Considering the detrimental nature of bribery and corruption, it 
				has been important to build strong partnerships among different 
				stakeholders and economies. To this end, the OECD has worked 
				with governments to promote anti-corruption activities.<br>
				<br>
				Despite the complexities of tracking bribery, it is clear that 
				companies will increasingly seek to reduce their exposure to 
				illegal payments and will seek to ensure compliance to safeguard 
				themselves from investigations, penalties, fines and 
				unfavourable media attention.&#8194;</font></td>

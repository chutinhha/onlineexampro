				<img border="0" src="http://www.oeronline.com/images/golfupdate-logo.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #808080; float: right;">Tiger 
				Woods’ bid for a first PGA Tour victory in over two years ended 
				prematurely when he lost one-down to fellow American Nick Watney 
				at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. The three-time 
				champion struggled with his putting on the heavily contoured 
				greens at Dove Mountain’s Ritz-Carlton Golf Club and never got 
				back on level terms after going one down at the 10th.<br>
				<br>
				Though Woods won the par-three 16th after his opponent’s tee 
				shot sailed over the grandstand at the back of the green to trim 
				the deficit from two-down, he missed a six-foot birdie putt at 
				the 18th to keep the second-round match alive.<br>
				<br>
				<b>A familiar story</b><br>
				One week ago, Tiger Woods was outclassed by his old rival Phil 
				Mickelson in California at Pebble Beach Pro-Am suffering a 
				humiliating defeat. This is becoming a familiar story from 
				Woods, whose swing under the tutelage of Sean Foley has improved 
				markedly in recent months. But good as his ball-striking has 
				become, there is a fragility about his putting that does not 
				bode well for his hopes of returning to the top of the game’s 
				totem pole.<br>
				<br>
				In January in Abu Dhabi Woods went into the final round in a tie 
				for the lead alongside England’s Robert Rock and could finish 
				only in third place. Attempting to win an official event for the 
				first time in 26 months, Woods had finished third to unheralded 
				Robert Rock, an Englishman who won for just the second time in 
				his European Tour career. Rory McIlroy finished second, a shot 
				behind Rock.<br>
				<br>
				“I was just a touch off today. I was hitting the ball through 
				the fairways and a couple of my iron shots were going a lot 
				further than they were supposed to. I just need to keep building 
				and get more consistency,” Woods said afterwards. Though it was 
				a fair assessment, it failed to address a subject that is 
				becoming apparent to those who have followed the great man’s 
				career over the years. There was a time when Woods’s mere 
				arrival on the first tee would have buckled the knees of a man 
				such as Rock, who confessed on the eve of the final round that 
				he was feeling extremely nervous at the prospect of having to 
				battle Woods in the final group. “Robert played great today. He 
				was solid, he was consistent and he didn’t do anything wrong. He 
				was in play, he was consistent, hit a couple of beautiful iron 
				shots down the stretch and made some putts,” he said of the 
				winner.<br>
				<br>
				Such has been the generally mediocre standard of Woods’ play 
				over the last two years, he has had perhaps only half a dozen 
				realistic chances of winning. But when opportunity has presented 
				itself he has been unable to take advantage.<br>
				<br>
				The sole exception was the Chevron World Challenge at the tail 
				end of 2011, when he birdied the final two holes to hold off 
				Zach Johnson for victory. But that was a tournament with a 
				limited field of 18 players and was not an official event.<br>

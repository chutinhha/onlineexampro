				Producing a Bentley means maintaining critical tolerances, 
				involving precision tooling and skilled operators all of whom 
				combine to achieve dizzy levels of dimensional accuracy and 
				integrity. Such attention to detail and craftsmanship of the 
				whole manufacturing process makes a Bentley the prized 
				possession of a car lover, says Visvas Paul D Karra after 
				visiting the plant in Crewe, England<br>
				<br>
				Bentley is all about providing individual care and attention, 
				not only at the production level of the car but also in catering 
				to the bespoke demands of customers. Every car is made to order 
				and involves exquisite craftsmanship, just like in the olden 
				days when every Bentley that was on the road used to be unique 
				piece of style and motion designed and built by clever 
				coachbuilders. The capacity for speed is an attractive attribute 
				in a Bentley, but in manufacturing the finest motor cars, the 
				quest for perfection cannot be hurried. It takes some eight days 
				to achieve the level of finish and body protection synonymous 
				with these vehicles.<br>
				<br>
				One of the interesting aspects of producing a Bentley is that 
				technology has been harnessed for speed, but all the core skills 
				remain in the hands of humans. For instance, every Bentley’s 
				interior veneer is unique as it is marked with the chassis 
				number of the car for which it is intended. It takes 13 days to 
				produce a set of veneers for one Bentley with 80 craftsmen 
				working in the Wood Shop.<br>

				<br>
				The distinctive burr walnut pattern is produced over years by a 
				fungus, which affects the root ball, and become more valuable 
				than the trees, which have passed their best as fruit producers. 
				Every tree felled is replaced by another. Burr walnut is the 
				most familiar but by no means the only veneer used at Crewe. 
				English oak is also available, as is the increasingly rare elm, 
				and the company has introduced two woods, madrona and vavona. 
				Endangered varieties such as mahogany are not used. Birds eye 
				maple is another wood to provide a distinctive grainy pattern, 
				though it is also the hardest to work with. Some customers opt 
				for straight-grain walnut veneers, and solid walnut is used for 
				parts of the car, such as the waist rails.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Mirror image<br>
				</b>It is the job of Veneer Selector Adrian Minshull to travel 
				to Italy and elsewhere to meet the importers of root balls. He 
				can provide an accurate estimate of how many car interiors can 
				be veneered once the ball has been sliced into 0.6mm leaves. <br>
				<br>
				The Wood Shop uses 16 leaves to create the 26 central components 
				in a Bentley, plus another eight for the waist rails. Options 
				such as picnic tables or additional door panels could bring the 
				veneer used in a Bentley to as much as 6.5sq m (21.3sq ft).<br>
				<br>
				Making full use of the recurring pattern throughout the root or 
				log, the leaves are doubled up to create a mirror-image effect. 
				For example, four leaves are taped end to end to form a 
				symmetrical pattern across the centreline of the facia, and this 
				pattern is matched and echoed in the console to create a 
				cascading effect throughout the vehicle. The waist rails also 
				mirror each other, with the same pattern repeated on each door.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Accuracy and integrity<br>
				</b>Precision engineering is evident in the state-of-the-art 
				Body Assembly Hall at Crewe. Where gaps are required between 
				steel panels, for example, they are uniform, set at exactly 
				3.5mm.<br>
				<br>
				Four-axis measuring machines check no fewer than 2,500 measuring 
				points. In addition, the achievement of joints between body 
				panels that are almost invisible is the result of abandoning 
				standard “hot weld” technology, which can cause distortion of 
				panels at the weld points. Instead, Crewe has adopted 
				plasma-brazing “cold weld” technology, which leaves a pristine 
				finish ready for painting.<br>
&nbsp;</font><p align="center" style="margin: 10px; ">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<img border="0" src="images/autotalk-aug-12-3.jpg" width="460" height="154" style="border: 1px solid #808080" class="style4"></font><p align="justify" style="margin: 10px; ">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				Behind orange safety curtains, the plasma-welding teams can be 
				seen at work on the major body assemblies. Elsewhere in the 
				hall, suspended computer-controlled guns are used to assemble 
				body sections mounted on jigs. These hand-held tools allow 
				accurate positioning of the 6,500 spot welds required to 
				optimise torsional rigidity on each monocoque steel bodyshell. 
				No other manufacturer goes in for spot-welding on this scale.<br>
				<br>
				The visitor will notice that although there are fans to blow any 
				fumes away from the welders, they raise only the lightest 
				breeze. That is to avoid blowing dust around the Body Assembly 
				Hall which, like every other area at Crewe, is conspicuously 
				clean. Between 540 and 560 components are used to construct each 
				body. By the time each one leaves the assembly hall, it will 
				incorporate some 3m of MIG wire, 1.5m of brazing, and about 200 
				nuts.<br>
				<br>
				It takes about three weeks to turn those 540-odd components into 
				a complete, inspected bodyshell ready to go on to the next 
				stage. Working a single eight-hour shift, the teams currently 
				send 35 bodies on their way to the paintshop each week. And as 
				each body goes on its way, it is already earmarked for one 
				particular customer.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Gleaming perfection<br>
				</b>The bare metal bodies pass through 16 stages of development 
				and 120 separate processes before they depart in a state of 
				gleaming perfection. There are 26 standard and a number of 
				non-standard colours but since the latest product launch, 111 
				colours were individually matched. The paint shop is often asked 
				to match a colour - to a bottle of nail lacquer or even a pink 
				toothbrush.<br>
				<br>
				“Ninety per cent of the materials applied to our car bodies are 
				concerned solely with protection and ensuring a durable finish,” 
				says John McNicholas, Zone Manager in the Auto Paint Shop. The 
				other 10 per cent is about aesthetics. But what aesthetics! The 
				first thing you notice when you look at a Bentley is how lovely 
				the paintwork looks.<br>
				<br>
				A process that can take eight days is telescoped into less than 
				an hour when you walk alongside the conveyors in the Paint Shop 
				at Crewe (there are 2.2 miles of track altogether!). Here, in 
				one of the most advanced facilities of its kind, a procession of 
				bodies arrive in bare white metal and will pass through 16 
				stages of development and 120 separate processes before they are 
				ready to depart in a state of gleaming perfection. John is 
				responsible for production planning, personnel and quality 
				control.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The comfort zone <br>
				</b>Mike Garnett, known to everyone as Slim, has worked at Crewe 
				for 35 years. He is a man absorbed in the craft of working with 
				leather, and in the many ways in which this and other fabrics 
				can be made to soften the feel of a vehicle and make it a 
				luxurious haven for its owner.<br>
				<br>
				His knowledge is wide-ranging and detailed and his skill 
				extraordinary. “We can do, and have done, everything a customer 
				wants,” he says. “If you want a car interior designed in the 
				style of a room in your house, or to match the tie you’re 
				wearing, we can arrange that. We have used ostrich hide, cavalry 
				twill, and velvets. It’s the same with colours - there are 17 
				standard ones, but we have been asked by ladies to match the 
				nail varnish they are wearing, and by princesses to satisfy 
				their taste in haute couture fabrics. We have always, so far, 
				been able to meet their exact requirements.”<br>
				<br>
				How many hides does it take to trim a Bentley? The 9-17 cows 
				whose hide is needed to trim one will all have been reared 
				principally for their meat but the hide that is the by-product 
				is the very finest, and each one will provide around 46sq ft 
				(4.27sq m) of leather.<br>
				<br>
				Bentley has invested half a million pounds in state-of-the-art 
				cutting equipment. With the use of a multi tool cutting head 
				this equipment enables us to achieve cutting accuracy of 0.1mm 
				on all of the 400 or so hide panels it takes to make up an 
				interior of a Bentley. Many tasks, such as lining up 
				stitch-lines in top rolls or the fluting in seats, or trimming 
				into tight corners, require consummate skill.<br>
				<br>
				Fabricated items such as seats have to be electronically tested 
				before they are transferred into the car. The final audit under 
				bright inspection lights is comprehensive and will reveal any 
				area that requires reworking. It takes an average of six days to 
				produce the finished leather trim for each Bentley.&#8194;<br>

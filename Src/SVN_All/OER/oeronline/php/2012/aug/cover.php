				Free insurance, free service, free registration, free extended 
				warranty, buy back facility, AAA service, complementary I-Pad 3 
				or a Samsung Galaxy S III, scratch and win cards, instant gifts, 
				free credit card, sale, offers, bundled packages! Phew<br>
				<br>
				Walk into a mall, open a newspaper or browse through a magazine 
				during the month of Ramadan and the first thing that meets the 
				eye are danglers, posters and advertisements regarding 
				promotions, offers, gifts and prizes that are up for grabs. A 
				regular shopping outing to a hypermarket or supermarket promises 
				a life changing opportunity with a chance to win multiple four 
				wheel drives, sedan cars, refrigerators, washing machines, 
				microwaves, phones, cameras et al. Buying a car could not get 
				better as almost every distributor throws in numerous freebies 
				like registration, insurance, service warranty topping it up 
				with gifts. Furniture, clothes, refrigerators, TVs, cameras, 
				household utensils are all up for grabs at sale prices. If you 
				have not made it to the neighbouring mall or automobile outlet 
				as yet, probably you never will, because it does not get bigger 
				or better than this.<br>
				<br>
				In a market where even banks have swapped the mandatory interest 
				schemes with prize money offerings, the lure, pull and draw of 
				promotions as a marketing tool can hardly be overstated. Ramadan 
				offers are the big daddy of all other sales and promotions. It’s 
				a time when companies slug it out to mount the biggest and best 
				offers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>A time for giving</b><br>
				Promotions and offers are not specific to the GCC region and one 
				finds parallels in other countries, like Christmas sales in the 
				US and Europe, Diwali discounts in India and the Chinese New 
				Year shopping season in China and Hong Kong. While Ramadan 
				promotions mirror the traits of other promotions, it’s unique 
				mix of religiosity, bonding, spending and gifting gives it a 
				distinct flavour. Says Pankaj Joshi, marketing manager, Al 
				Jenaibi International Automobiles, “As it is important for a 
				brand to be ingrained in the local culture and keeping with the 
				Ramadan tradition of giving, we want to offer our customers a 
				grand value offer.” Adds Ananth A V, regional director – Oman, 
				Lulu, “Ramadan is a time when friends and families bond 
				together, reflecting their shared relationships and brotherhood. 
				As an extension of that logic, it is only natural that household 
				spends witness a change.”<br>
				<br>
				The various rituals surrounding the holy month like suhoor, 
				fasting and iftars give a fillip to the sale of certain 
				categories like food, beverages and utensils. High on the 
				shopping lists are powdered beverages, concentrated juices, 
				energy and sports drinks, rice, water, long-life milk, yogurt, 
				laban, cooking oil and ghee. The increase in these categories 
				range between five to 20 per cent. Concentrated juices like 
				Vimto, Roof Afza etc see their sales skyrocket by three to five 
				times, as they become an indispensable part of various meals. 
				George Alexander, general manager, retail, engineering and 
				distribution, Omasco says, “As during a festive season people 
				tend to be light hearted and spend more, a lot of small utensils 
				are purchased and these are used for iftars and storing food.” 
				Festivities surrounding Eid gives an impetus to shopping for 
				clothes and gifts. Says Vivek C Pande, CEO, life style group, 
				Khimji Ramdas, “During the last ten days of Ramadan, a lot of 
				gifts are bought as people want to exchange these with their 
				friends and relatives.”<br>
				<br>
				Companies have been quick to realise that customers are in a 
				mood to loosen their purse strings during the festive season and 
				want to make the most of the available opportunity.<br>
				<br>
				Says Mohammad al Farei, managing director, Zeenah Group, “Over 
				the years businesses have seen spends go up during the month of 
				Ramadan and they want to capture on this trend as much as 
				possible through promotions and offers.”<br>
				<br>
				An increase in sales is not limited to necessities like food and 
				gifts, but also encompasses high value items like car, furniture 
				and even houses. There is broad unanimity that there is a major 
				spike in sales during the month of Ramadan across product 
				categories. <br>
				<br>
				Says Rajesh Raman, vice-president – Oman, Menacom Group, “A 
				number of companies report up to 30 per cent of their annual 
				sales in and around the month of Ramadan.”<br>
				<br>
				Says Joshi, “During these two months our sales increase by 10-12 
				per cent.”<br>
				<br>
				Marketers use Ramadan offers as a strategic tool to attract 
				customers, giving an additional boost to sales during this 
				month. Ambuj Khare, senior general manager, Genetco, 
				corroborates, “We try and find out what customers need and try 
				to incentivise those purchases. During the last two years we 
				have witnessed a 20-25 per cent growth, primarily because of the 
				all round festivity.” Based on historical precedence, customers 
				are aware that various distributors and brands will roll out 
				alluring offers during the month. This makes them delay their 
				shopping plans (for non essential items), till Ramadan so that 
				they can make the most of the revised pricing.<br>
				<br>
				For example, a number of customers buy their cars during Ramadan 
				and so after a couple of years when they want to upgrade or 
				change their cars they usually do it again during Ramadan. Says 
				Abdel Karim Awwad, national sales and marketing manager, Audi 
				Oman, “Our objective is not to lure customers into spending 
				money, they will do that either way in this season. It is done 
				so that they spend money on our product rather than the 
				competition. And it would be a silly business proposition for us 
				not to do so as it is a competitive market after all.”<br>
				<br>
				The other push factor aiding sales during Ramadan are government 
				bonuses (given to select departments) and the fact that a number 
				of companies advance the dates on which they give salaries, so 
				that employees can enjoy the festive season with their families. 
				Banks and insurance companies too throw in generous offers like 
				low interest rates helping customers. In certain cases interest 
				rates on car loans fall to as low as 1.5-2.0 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				Another big draw of Ramadan promotions is the fact that they are 
				more broad based compared to other offers. Says Joshi, “While we 
				may have tactical promotions on certain key models at various 
				times of the year, during Ramadan we offer across the board 
				promotions on all our models. We call it a season of offers as 
				it goes on for almost two months. This year it is running from 
				mid July to September.” Khare of Genetco adds, “Some people may 
				be in a position to get an off season discount individually, but 
				everyone is not in a position to avail of such discounts. During 
				Ramadan we offer an incentive on our products to all our 
				customers.” The universality of Ramadan promotions thus becomes 
				a big motivator for people to go out and shop.<br>
				<br>
				Strangely, the lure of promotions cuts across income segments, 
				appealing to the affluent as much as to others. For example, a 
				number of BMW and Audi customers start enquiring about the 
				seasons promotion on models a month in advance. Says Raman, 
				“Value for money holds true at every price point, people who can 
				afford the better things in life are as conscious about money as 
				others.” Says Rajiv Ahuja, head- corporate communications, 
				Khimji Ramdas, “It is in human nature to be pleased with gifts 
				and something extra.” According to the Ministry of Commerce and 
				Industry guidelines, companies can only launch three promotions 
				of two months each in a year.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Enabling factors <br>
				</b>The question arises as to what enables companies to offer 
				such discounts during the month of Ramadan and why can’t such 
				offers be replicated through the year. The biggest reason 
				offered is that the large surge in volumes and numbers help 
				companies to offer lower prices. So though their margins per SKU 
				(stock keeping unit) or product may be lower, but this gets 
				compensated by the higher throughput. Says Alexander, 
				“Profitability would get affected if sales were slow but the 
				increase in volumes makes sure that despite lower margins on 
				individual products, it turns out to be a good deal on the 
				whole.” Adds Abdel Karim, “ People have no need to make large 
				purchases throughout the year. But in seasons like this people 
				are more likely to make large purchases of items that they will 
				not normally buy at other times of the year. From a sales 
				perspective, we can take advantage of this shopping spike and 
				offer better deals. This is because we can sell a large number 
				of our stock and make profit in volume rather than individual 
				sales.”<br>
				<br>
				The challenge for marketing heads is to forecast correctly the 
				larger inventory that they would require during the festive 
				season. A larger order than actual sales would leave them with 
				surplus inventory, conversely, if they run out of stocks, it 
				would turn out to be a lost opportunity. Based on historical 
				factors, marketers usually predict the volumes that they would 
				require and hope that the scales do not tilt on either side. 
				Most companies have perfected this through a trial and error 
				process.<br>
				<br>
				The other enabler is the support that companies receive from 
				their principals. Most large companies (MNCs and regional 
				players) set aside a certain amount of their annual budgets for 
				promotions and seasonal offers. Based on the market dynamics and 
				distributor feedback, they extend this budget as financial 
				support to their partners. Says Ahuja, “A certain amount of the 
				turnover of the principal and distributors is reserved for sale 
				promotions and the budget for any discount, freebies, limited 
				time offer comes from this.” Based on historical indicators, a 
				call is taken on the best time and way to utilise this budget 
				and in the case of the Middle East market, Ramadan and Eid prove 
				to be a natural choice for such promotions.<br>
				<br>
				Says Alexander, “The principal’s support comes in different 
				ways, they may give you branding support or pre package a gift 
				along with another item or they may split the cost of the 
				promotion equally with the distributor.”As a norm support from 
				the principals is offered in the following ways. First, they may 
				give higher budgets to the dealer/distributor, which can be 
				utilised for promotions, brand building, prizes, freebies etc. 
				Second, the cost of certain promotions may be shared equally 
				between the principal and the distributor. Third, there are 
				times when the principal may bundle a particular product as a 
				freebie or gift with another product. For example, a blender may 
				be bundled with a microwave oven or a vacuum cleaner may be 
				given along with a TV. To cite a few examples, during this 
				Ramadan, P&amp;G is offering a limited time offer on its products 
				like Ariel and Pampers by bundling together more than one pack, 
				for the same or a lower price.<br>
				<br>
				While a principal offers support they also use a check and 
				balance mechanism to ensure that these promotions do not go 
				overboard or affect the larger regional market. As a rule all 
				promotional schemes have to be approved by the principal before 
				their launch. A number of companies strive to maintain price 
				parity between different markets in the region and too much 
				discounting in one market can damage a brand’s reputation in 
				other countries. “Our margins are fixed as brands like Rolex 
				maintain the same price across the region,” says Pande.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Clout of the retailer </b><br>
				The pressure from the big hypermarkets like Lulu and Carrefour 
				is cited as a crucial factor for the growing number of 
				promotions that one witnesses these days. As shopping patterns 
				change and more people gravitate towards hypermarkets and large 
				format stores, retail chains are in a position to dictate terms 
				to companies akin to a Walmart in the US.<br>
				<br>
				The market can be divided into tier 1 retailers like Lulu and 
				Carrefour; tier 2 retail outlets like Al Safeer, Mars 
				Hypermarket, K M Trading etc; specialised shops and power 
				retailers like E-Max, Sharaf, DG and the Ruwi high street. Tier 
				1 retailers command an overwhelming share of the market. In the 
				audio visual segment tier 1 retailers account for about 50 per 
				cent of total sales, the rest being shared by the remaining 
				outlets. Given the predominance of the large retail chains, they 
				are in a position to dictate terms to distributors. 
				“Hypermarkets would like footfalls to happen and as a result 
				they are putting the onus on distributors to give them better 
				pricing almost through the year, whether it is a Ramadan 
				promotion or back to school offers and it is all becoming a 
				gimmick,” says Alexander.<br>
				<br>
				A marketing executive explains the modus operandi used by large 
				format stores – as they know that a discount or a promotion 
				draws customers, so even if there is a two per cent off on an 
				item, they will allocate it prime shelf space. This works as a 
				magnet drawing footfalls for the entire hypermarket. Most 
				marketers realise that if one brand or product is placed below 
				the golden zone area (waist to shoulder height), the probability 
				of it being picked up gets reduced. Everyone realises that 
				addressability is big issue and once a customer sees a product 
				that is within the price range that he is willing to pay, he 
				tends to get swayed by what he sees. Adds Raman, “Brand loyalty 
				in various categories is low and products are increasingly 
				interchangeable, so if a customer finds a good deal on a 
				particular product, he tends to flip his choices.” Faced with 
				this predicament, most marketers are only too eager to follow 
				the diktat of tier 1 retailers.<br>
				<br>
				Most hypermarkets though tend to refute such claims. Says Ananth 
				of Lulu, “Any company or brand aspiring towards growth and sales 
				turnover is indeed focused on achieving greater visibility and 
				recall. A hypermarket chain like Lulu offers numerous 
				opportunities and options for companies to do so. Companies take 
				advantage of such opportunities, which fetches them the 
				visibility and reach, they need, within their respective target 
				segments.”<br>
				<br>
				Renting of shelf space is one of the prime revenue generators of 
				retail chains worldwide and something that is bound to be 
				followed by them locally. Says Pande, “The main income of 
				supermarkets and hypermarkets comes from selling shelf space, so 
				from their point of view they are completely justified in 
				selling space to companies and brands based on their 
				preferences.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Taking a long term view<br>
				</b>A shopping carnival like this is not a mere opportunity to 
				push through more sales but also a chance to achieve other 
				strategic goals. Says Mohammad of Zeenah, “Promotions can also 
				be seen as a tactical brand building opportunity. Such chances 
				help in aiding recall, getting higher sales from existing 
				customers and helping in the acquisition of new customers.” Thus 
				there are a host of brand related benefits that one can derive 
				from large scale and tempting promotions.<br>
				<br>
				Audi-Oman is looking at doing something similar with its RO2,000 
				worth of incentive offer (One year free insurance, a 13” MacBook 
				Pro, a dinner for four at Shangri-La’s Barr Al Jissah Resort, a 
				chance to win an Audi A1, 185hp 5 year/105,000 km service, 
				24-hour roadside assistance and a three year unlimited mileage 
				warranty) on its high-end cars like the Audi A6, Audi A7 or Audi 
				A8 L. Says Abdel Karim, “It is a long term strategy. We are not 
				only selling cars, but the idea is to increase our market share 
				and presence and that itself is a marketing strategy. The best 
				way to see the success of a car is to see it on the road and to 
				let customers experience our service.” The distributor’s aim is 
				to let people have an Audi experience and to come and look at 
				the car’s heritage.<br>
				<br>
				If it is an excuse to build brands for some, for others it is a 
				good occasion to let people sample new products. As people shop 
				around till late hours with their families, a number of food and 
				beverage companies put up kiosks in hypermarkets and 
				supermarkets inviting people to sample their new offerings. 
				Products which are received well, get introduced in quick 
				succession to encash on the positive word of mouth publicity.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The negative fallout<br>
				</b>On the flip side, constant discounts and promotions can end 
				up hurting companies and brands irrevocably and for some the 
				tipping point may be approaching fast. “Everyone gets impacted 
				and the brand value of products get eroded due to constant 
				discounting. As long as sales are going up, these can be 
				managed, but in a downturn it will have a massive effect. People 
				think that their short term gains will wipe away their long term 
				sins but in the long run people will lose out,” says Alexander.<br>
				<br>
				According to market estimates, in the audio visual segment there 
				has been a 20 per cent reduction in margins over the last few 
				years. Says Ambuj, “Our margins have gone down drastically, in 
				the AV segment the market is in the hands of two or three 
				companies who are the opinion makers, while we are the 
				followers.” The constant price reductions have forced Japanese 
				brands like Panasonic, Sharp and Sony to take some drastic 
				measures. Some of these brands have announced that there will be 
				no future price revisions on its 32 to 55 inch flat panel LCD 
				TVs for now.<br>
				<br>
				Others are quick to point out that the AV segment may be an 
				exception to the norm when it comes to discounting, due to its 
				high obsolescence rate. As product life cycles get shorter, 
				there is a tendency to sell quickly forcing companies to use a 
				discounting strategy. The fact that there are managers chasing 
				quarterly, semi yearly and annual targets makes a bad situation 
				worse.<br>
				<br>
				There is a feeling that since the principals operate through an 
				authorised distributor in the GCC market, there is more 
				discounting and price undercutting. As the profit of a 
				distributor is based on sales, he is constantly on the lookout 
				for marketing opportunities, giving little thought to brand 
				building. There are others who contest this line of reasoning. 
				“There is an international and a local brand and the success of 
				a product depends on the success of both these elements coming 
				together. The local distributor is an extended arm of the 
				principal and a majority of the local customers go by the 
				reputation of the distributor,” says Khare. “The brand equity of 
				a local distributor is an important consideration while making a 
				high value purchase,” <br>
				<br>
				<b>adds Raman.<br>
				</b>A few brands use the festive season as a chance to liquidate 
				excess inventory, by offering garage sale prices. This can have 
				disastrous consequences for a brand, as the distributor can 
				never go back to selling the product at higher prices. It also 
				cheapens the brand in customer minds. Ramadan promotions also 
				leads to a drop in sales in the months that follow as the 
				purchasing power of consumers goes down.<br>
				<br>
				Aware of such dangers, most marketers are conscious about 
				offering a value proposition. Says Ananth, “Our customers are 
				more value-driven rather than discount driven and that being the 
				case, it is important for us to keep our value proposition 
				intact. We have a system in place that not only constantly 
				evaluates products and their prices, but also ensures that it 
				lives up to our core concept of value. We are sure that these 
				promotions are more beneficial to our customers as well as our 
				suppliers and need to be viewed as a win-win situation for all.” 
				Going by the penchant of people for promotions, one can safely 
				assume that promotions, discounts and offers are here to stay. 
				So let’s drop that raffle in the drop box and hope to get 
				lucky.&#8194;</td>

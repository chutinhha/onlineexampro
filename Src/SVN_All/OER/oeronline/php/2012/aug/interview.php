				<b>Can you explain about the concept of Diners Club and its 
				evolution?<br>
				</b>Diners Club is the first independent charge and credit card 
				in the world. There is an incredible story about its origin. 
				When Frank X McNamara went out for dinner one evening back in 
				the 1950s he forgot his cash and got very embarrassed as he 
				couldn’t pay the bill. So he decided that he would start off a 
				card that would enable people to pay, primarily, for their 
				dinner and that is why it was called Diners Club. <br>
				<br>
				And from there it developed considerably to be a major travel 
				and entertainment card and then, in many countries, a leading 
				credit/charge card. Although a number of people have bought the 
				business including Citibank, it is now owned by Discover 
				Financial Services, a large, and very successful, payment 
				service company in the US and globally. Discover is able to 
				achieve a lot of synergies from their existing payment business 
				for the Diners Club brand. It is an interesting concept because 
				Discover owns the brand “Diners Club International” and 
				everything about it, but it has individual franchises in various 
				countries around the world which manage the operation on a 
				day-to-day basis. The local issuing banks hold the credit card 
				receivables on their balance sheets but pay royalties to Diners 
				Club International for the use of the brand, marketing support, 
				system support etc. There are franchises all over the world. 
				Commercial Bank of Qatar owns the Omani and Qatari franchises.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is the significance of your recent re-launch in Oman?</b><br>
				The re-launch is an interesting story. The Diners Club card has 
				been in Oman since around 1980 and the franchise has been 
				through a number of different ownerships. But it has never been 
				marketed aggressively or been a leading force in the Oman card 
				market. When Commercial Bank of Qatar, which owns 35 per cent of 
				National Bank of Oman (NBO), bought the franchise from the then 
				owners in 2007, the idea was to make it part of the overall NBO 
				family.<br>
				<br>
				But, for a number of reasons that has not happened, although NBO 
				has recently provided all their Sadara customers with a Diners 
				Card. When I joined Commercial Bank of Qatar at the beginning of 
				2011 and became an independent director for NBO, I also looked 
				into the opportunity to launch a standalone credit card (Diners) 
				in the Sultanate. When I compared the financial services market 
				here to that of the US and Europe, I could see there was 
				something extra we could bring to the Omani market and that was 
				personal service. I strongly believe when you launch a product 
				with a real service promise and you deliver on that promise, 
				then people will start using the product and being its best 
				advocate.<br>
				<br>
				I also thought that with the economy of the country growing 
				there was a potential market for a new credit card targeting the 
				high-net worth and affluent individuals. I also spoke to the 
				Central Bank of Oman and they were supportive of any initiative 
				to encourage electronic banking and take more physical cash out 
				of the market. I therefore agreed a business plan with the 
				Commercial Bank of Qatar to re-launch the Diners Card in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What segment of customers you are targeting?</b><br>
				Diners Club are not competing with the mass market credit cards, 
				but we are providing an exceptional high standard of personal 
				service for high net worth and affluent individuals who can take 
				advantage of the features of the card. We are looking at people 
				with a minimum monthly salary of circa RO2000 per month. We have 
				had a lot of applications from people below that level and we 
				just politely say that this is not the market segment we are 
				looking at. There are another two areas of great opportunities 
				for us. I did not really see a card specifically marketed to the 
				corporate sector which enables the corporates to provide a card 
				for all its senior management team to be able to travel and to 
				entertain. In addition, the SMEs were slightly neglected in 
				terms of their ability to manage their cash flow and I think a 
				card carefully underwritten and carefully managed can give SMEs 
				an opportunity to better manage their cashflows. In September, 
				we will be launching a corporate card specifically designed as a 
				travel and entertainment card for corporate and SME customers. 
				Another area is the travel segment where we can tie up with 
				large corporate and travel companies to fund their travel 
				arrangements. We are also looking at a ladies only card with 
				different attractive features designed specifically for the 
				ladies in Oman and meeting their requirements in a credit card.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What are your unique selling propositions?</b><br>
				In terms of the price, we have the most competitive interest 
				rate in the market. We have excellent service as we provide a 
				24-hour contact service and for high-net worth individuals and 
				they will have their own personal relationship person who they 
				can call at any time. This will be a personal relationship 
				manager based in Oman, who will be available to provide instant 
				service whenever and from wherever the customer calls. We will 
				also be in touch with our Diners Card customers on a regular 
				basis to update them on new features and services available on 
				the card. The card also provides complementary access to 450 
				airport lounges worldwide, a simple loyalty reward programme, 
				leading insurance cover, coupled with the lowest credit card 
				rate of interest in Oman and the personal service aspect makes 
				our card a unique proposition. Everyone has insurance coverage 
				of various descriptions on every credit card but not a lot of 
				people are actually aware of what they have. We have provided 
				one of the best offerings in the market and we are explaining to 
				our customers exactly what coverage they have available.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What about your interest rate and fee structure?</b><br>
				We got a standard annual fee. But at the moment we are giving 
				the discount for new customers. Our interest rate is 1.25 per 
				cent per month and that is the lowest in the Sultanate.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How is the response from the market so far?</b><br>
				Since we launched at the end of June we have signed a couple of 
				hundred new customers. We already had a small base of customers 
				and NBO has around 2000 Diners Club cardholders as part of its 
				card offering to their Sadara customers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What about the acceptance of your cards in the retail market?</b><br>
				In the retail market our cards are accepted virtually 
				everywhere. Following a major merchant sales campaign before our 
				launch, Diners Club is now accepted in over 3000 shops, 
				restaurants, hotels, petrol stations and other outlets in Oman. 
				The cards can also be used in more than 185 countries, millions 
				of merchant locations and 845,000 ATMs globally making the card 
				a perfect travel companion for any Omani customer travelling to 
				Dubai for the weekend or further away on business or holiday.</td>

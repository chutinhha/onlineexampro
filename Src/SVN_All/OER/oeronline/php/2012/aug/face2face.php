				<br>
				<b>Now that the HSBC-Oman International Bank (OIB) merger has 
				been formalised, what are the top three priorities for you as 
				the CEO of the new bank? <br>
				</b>It’s really hard to list a set of priorities; but always you 
				have to be led by your responsibilities and our top 
				responsibility is towards our staff and our customers. Without a 
				doubt, happy staff means happy customers, happy customers means 
				good business and this is good for the country. We are very 
				focused on what we should be providing to our staff and 
				customers in terms of everything – the terms and conditions, 
				business opportunities and other propositions. It is very 
				important for us that our primary stakeholders who are our 
				customers and staff really enjoy the benefits of this merger as 
				soon as they possibly can. Leading from that is the second part 
				which is the integration process.<br>
				<br>
				We have set up a very challenging timeline to complete the 
				integration, as you know the merger was completed on May 31, 
				2012, when we had the OGM appointing the current Board of HSBC 
				Bank Oman and we intend to complete the technical integration, 
				to have one operating platform, common systems across the whole 
				bank and the branch network by December 2012. We hope that by 
				December, customers should be able to see the HSBC Bank Oman 
				branding across all the branches in the Sultanate, and wherever 
				you see this branding you will get the whole proposition on a 
				combined platform. The third priority is business growth and 
				that is not selfish as we have a duty to our shareholders. We 
				should not forget that while HSBC owns the majority of the 
				shares at 51 per cent, we have a duty towards 49 per cent of our 
				local Omani stakeholders.<br>
				<br>
				We also have a responsibility to the Omani banking sector, as we 
				are the second largest bank and it is vital that we contribute 
				to the growth of the banking sector. We are in a unique position 
				with HSBC Bank Oman and we are delighted to be in this banking 
				sector as a local bank now. We are here to provide an 
				alternative to the other banks in the market and also to 
				cooperate with them on larger deals that no bank would like to 
				take on exclusively.<br>
				<br>
				While we are a true local bank, unlike any other local bank, we 
				can also provide a window to the world for Oman. We can bring 
				the best of financial services from wherever we operate into 
				Oman and ensure that we are an ambassador for Oman wherever HSBC 
				operates. We see ourselves as not only focusing on business 
				growth here for our shareholders but also on business growth for 
				Oman as we are going to promote international trade into Oman 
				from all the 85 countries where HSBC operates. We feel that we 
				will be playing a serious role in connecting Oman 
				internationally.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What are the potential synergies of the merged entity in 
				terms of larger capital base and networth. Will HSBC Bank Oman 
				participate in large project financing deals and can we look 
				forward to cross border deals under HSBC Group umbrella?</b><br>
				When you look at a larger capital base, it gives us the ability 
				to help more companies in Oman, which we will leverage, but 
				frankly that is not the prime motivator for HSBC Bank Oman. We 
				have a tremendous distribution network that allows us to garner 
				local funding and which puts us on a level playing field with 
				BankMuscat and NBO. There is much more than that, HSBC has been 
				in Oman since 1947 and we have been integral to the banking 
				community. But frankly HSBC had a six-branch network and it was 
				not able to bring the benefits that we have internationally into 
				Oman completely. Then we look at OIB and what a legacy they have 
				had. If you put HSBC’s international experience along with OIB’s 
				legacy and proven track record, that has to be a winning 
				combination for all stakeholders, customers, staff and the 
				community.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How would HSBC use the current network of OIB branches? Are 
				there any plans to rationalise the branch network?</b><br>
				On the integration side, we are on a tight schedule as we want 
				to be on one platform and one offer by December 2012. Customers 
				should be able to walk into any of our branches by December and 
				enjoy the full proposition in terms of customer service and 
				product offerings which are seamlessly linked across our entire 
				branch network. During that period, we will also have a fairly 
				comprehensive refurbishment plan. That’s not to say that all the 
				branches will be refurbished, as a number of OIB branches are 
				already in a fantastic shape right now under their own 
				refurbishment programme, but we will look at those branches 
				which have not been on the top of that list. We have already 
				given some branches a new coat of paint, in preparation for the 
				full refurbishment. There is a quite comprehensive branch 
				network strategy being developed.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Will the existing products of OIB and HSBC be retained or 
				rebranded and how will the process work till December 2012?</b><br>
				Frankly, customers need not do anything as of now. Former OIB 
				customers can continue to enjoy all the services that they used 
				to enjoy at OIB before the integration and the same goes for 
				HSBC customers. For people having an account in both the banks, 
				they can continue operating both their accounts. Once the 
				integration is complete, then customers will be given a choice 
				of either continuing with both the accounts or merge both the 
				accounts, with the same signing authority. I would like to 
				request all our customers both at OIB and HSBC to come to us and 
				update their details, so that we can get in touch with them and 
				advise them properly about all the things that are going on and 
				explain to them the various benefits that we offer.<br>
				<br>
				We want to offer the best products for the local market and the 
				best of international products and services, so we are looking 
				at our portfolio very closely. The question that I get asked 
				most often nowadays is – what will happen to Mandoos, as it 
				remains a favourite. We are not likely to discontinue something 
				that our customers like and want, so probably you will see 
				Mandoos being continued in an enhanced form. We will look at all 
				our products and see that we are offering the best value to our 
				clients. There will be some rationalisation as we are not going 
				to offer two versions of the same loan – as OIB and HSBC did, it 
				will be the HSBC Bank Oman loan proposition only and that will 
				be the best of both worlds.<br>
				<br>
				<b>HSBC has a strong Islamic Finance service under the Amanah 
				brand. Are there plans of introducing Islamic product and 
				services in Oman under the Amanah Brand? </b><br>
				As you know we are very quick to react, but we are also very 
				respectful of local regulations. We would prefer to wait and see 
				what the local regulations that the Central Bank of Oman and 
				other regulators advise us on so that we can react 
				appropriately.<br>
				<br>
				<b>HSBC operates on strict global practices in terms of risk and 
				lending. Will the application of such stringent standards impede 
				growth in the local market?</b><br>
				It is not going to restrict growth and it is not going to 
				restrict anything that our customers want, but I do not want to 
				mislead you. If you look at HSBC, we have grown very 
				effectively, and our lending policies have not restricted our 
				growth in anyway. Definitely there are differences amongst all 
				the banks and I would like to draw your attention to trade 
				finance. We are a trade finance bank, it is our bread and butter 
				and that’s where we have grown in Asia and the Middle East. If 
				you look at our trade finance share in Oman before the merger, 
				it was significantly higher than our overall market share. You 
				will not see HSBC massively changing its policies and 
				procedures, but what you will see are policies and procedures 
				that safeguard the bank, safeguard the banking sector and allow 
				us to grow and best serve our customer needs.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The bank will be incurring higher expenses towards 
				up-gradation of systems and process, infrastructure etc. What 
				impact will this have on your cost to income ratios?</b><br>
				As a listed entity, I am not allowed to comment on any forward 
				looking statements, but as you mentioned there will be a cost 
				for the integration process and that is one of the reasons why 
				we want to achieve that as fast as possible and then drive our 
				business forward. We have a very robust plan approved by our 
				board and which will show a very robust performance in the years 
				to come.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Can one expect HSBC Bank Oman to be more aggressive on the 
				investment banking side after the merger?</b><br>
				Given our status and size as a local bank, you will see a lot of 
				more activities as we will be looking at participating in all 
				the infrastructure projects and big ticket items both in terms 
				of funding and in terms of advisory work. The way in which we 
				deliver will not change markedly as we have world leading teams, 
				who have garnered a succession of awards in corporate advisory, 
				equity analysis and security services and we will continue 
				calling on their services. We will have a much larger team on 
				the ground to deal with what we hope will be a much larger 
				business.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Whenever two established entities merge, there is a risk of 
				the culture of the two organisations clashing. Is this a concern 
				area?</b><br>
				I would like to make two points regarding this: I don’t think 
				that there is much of a cultural difference. I have seen and 
				heard from many of our staff from OIB that they were former 
				employees of British Bank of the Middle East. If you look at OIB 
				and your readers would recognise this, it is a conservative, 
				traditional bank with very high standards of excellence, and it 
				is exactly the same with HSBC. There is no culture clash also 
				because these are two entities that know each other very well. 
				For example, OIB purchased 12 of our branches and a number of 
				those staff are still with us. One of OIB’s former general 
				managers HE Yahya Al Jabri was HSBC’s branch manager in Nizwa 
				and he rose to be the general manager of OIB and we both know 
				him as the regulator running the Capital Market Authority before 
				he became the chairman of the Special Economic Zone Authority at 
				Duqm (SEZAD). This merger is not new but history repeating 
				itself.<br>
				<br>
				The second point is that how different can cultures be anyway in 
				banking. It is an incredibly responsible industry where we are 
				looking after the future of our customers. In terms of retail, 
				we are allowing them to invest for their families or look after 
				their savings. On the corporate banking side, we are allowing 
				companies to grow and that is a national service. So the culture 
				won’t be dissimilar.<br>
				<br>
				HSBC has very strong values that are well recognised. Our 
				leading value is courageous integrity and that’s knowing when to 
				do the right thing and having no fear in doing the right thing. 
				I believe that this is a universal value and I have seen that my 
				new colleagues share the same. We break this value into three 
				things – being very open, so we have an open management style, 
				and we allow people to speak up and we expect them to do so, 
				without fear. Secondly, we believe ourselves to be connected – 
				not just being connected internationally, but being connected 
				with our customers, regulators and staff, and finally we are 
				dependable. For HSBC and OIB, we are going to do something we 
				tend to do. We are focused on things that we have said we will 
				be doing and a culture clash is not something that I will be 
				losing my sleep over.&#8194;</td>

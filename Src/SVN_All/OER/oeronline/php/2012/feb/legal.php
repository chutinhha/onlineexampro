				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
                		<b>Why Alternative Dispute Resolution?</b><br>
				People’s working definitions will vary, but a fair working 
				definition of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is any method 
				other than court or arbitration to resolve disputes. Alternative 
				dispute resolution methods include negotiation (assisted or 
				otherwise), mediation by a third neutral party, conciliation, on 
				occasion linked with the ability of the third party to make a 
				non-binding or binding determination of the issues in dispute.<br>
				<br>
				The avoiding of uncertainty, legal costs and delay is a major 
				reason why ADR is preferred: Parties have said to me, time and 
				again, that they only wish they had not incurred the costs (both 
				legal costs and management time) delays, stress and the 
				uncertainty of going to court or arbitration, having earlier 
				declined the opportunity of resolving the dispute by agreement. 
				It is easy, when a court hearing is a long way off, for a party 
				to “block out” the case against it. It can become painfully 
				apparent during the hearing, that the judge may not agree with 
				the party’s version of the facts in dispute, or may 
				misunderstand some technical aspects. Questions of law, at first 
				appearing to be of a straightforward nature, can result in 
				lengthy submissions and debate. By then, especially in 
				jurisdictions (unlike Oman) where a good proportion of incurred 
				legal costs are awarded to the “successful” party, the case has 
				adopted a life of its own, from which point it is difficult to 
				settle the dispute without substantial compromise. A principal 
				advantage of ADR methods is that they allow the parties to keep 
				control of the dispute in a necessarily private setting, and 
				allow creative remedies to be adopted. A judge or arbitrator is 
				bound to find for one party or the other and, generally, to 
				order remedies known to the law, such as a judgment in debt, an 
				award of damages for breach of a contract, or a declaration of a 
				party’s rights or obligations. ADR allows the parties creatively 
				to fashion their own resolution. In summary, the certainty of a 
				commercial result achieved by ADR beats the uncertainty of the 
				court system.<br>
				<br>
				The state of different industry sectors will also influence the 
				extent to which ADR methods are adopted. The current stage of 
				the “post GFC” construction sector in Oman, and the Middle East 
				generally, is that governments are the major procurers of major 
				infrastructure and building developments. International and 
				local construction companies for instance, who undertake these 
				projects, have a long-term interest in maintaining good working 
				relationships with government procurers, so that they may not be 
				ruled out of repeat work. Governments naturally also wish to 
				maintain good commercial relationships with these companies. 
				This means that both parties have an interest in avoiding 
				litigation or arbitration which, by their combative nature, 
				generally cause the collapse of commercial relationships. I will 
				now discuss the processes themselves.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is Mediation?</b><br>
				Mediation is a process by which an independent person, usually 
				trained in particular mediation skills, facilitates and 
				encourages the parties coming to their own agreement on how a 
				dispute is to be resolved. In order to encourage candour, 
				nothing said or done in a mediation can be relied on in any 
				subsequent legal or arbitral proceedings. Once the parties’ 
				agreement is put in writing, it becomes a contract, usually in 
				place of the contract upon which the dispute arose. If, as is 
				usually the case, it provides for the payment of a sum of money 
				by party A, then party B may sue party A in the event of 
				non-payment by party A. In Oman, the Court will often records 
				the contract in a judgment disposing of the proceeding.<br>
				<br>
				It is important to understand that the mediator is not usually 
				empowered to impose a solution on the parties. Either party is 
				free to walk away from the process at any time. In this event, a 
				skilled mediator will prevail upon the party to see the process 
				out, if he or she considers that the parties are still capable 
				of resolving their dispute. Good mediators can be quite 
				persuasive in this respect. Mediation of disputes is widespread 
				in business circles in Muscat and, indeed, is deeply rooted in 
				bedouin culture throughout Arabia.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is the process?</b><br>
				Some would argue that a mediator is someone who simply has the 
				trust of the parties, who can preside over negotiations in an 
				avuncular fashion, dispensing advice on process and the merits 
				of the parties’ respective cases. This is not what trained 
				mediators do. At the first “open session” of the mediation 
				hearing, the mediator should adopt the classic approach of 
				providing each of the parties an opportunity to state its case, 
				and to allow time for the mediator’s questions or those of the 
				counterparty. This is generally followed by the mediator’s 
				summarising on a white board the amount claimed by the claimant, 
				any amount claimed by the respondent, and the issues in dispute. 
				The white board is then used as the mediator’s and the parties’ 
				working document. The parties’ then agree that all issues have 
				been set out. The issues are then discussed sequentially. <br>
				<br>
				A prime feature of mediation is that the mediator then 
				interviews each party separately, behind closed doors. This is 
				why a properly conducted mediation requires at least two rooms, 
				and preferably three! There are always matters which a party 
				will be happier to disclose to the mediator in this setting 
				rather than the open session. It is a strict rule that anything 
				said to the mediator in this phase is confidential, unless the 
				mediator obtains express instructions from the party to disclose 
				it to the other side. This process recognises that the mediator, 
				armed privately with information about each party’s’ real 
				priorities and concerns, is better able to fashion a suggested 
				resolution than if he or she is armed only with information 
				disclosed during the first open session. The completion of the 
				closed sessions will often lead to an offer being made by one 
				party to the other. It can be a very difficult process for the 
				mediator to persuade a party to make the first offer but, having 
				done so, the mediator often becomes involved in “shuttle 
				diplomacy”, conveying offers and counter offers between the 
				respective rooms. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What skills does a trained mediator bring to the table?</b><br>
				Negotiation is obviously the first method by which protracted 
				disputes are resolved. A trained mediator, however, also reminds 
				each party of its “best alternative to a negotiated agreement” 
				(known as the BATNA) (viz. the amount it is likely to recover if 
				it ‘wins the case’, discounted by a percentage representing its 
				prospects of success, and a further discount representing its 
				irrecoverable legal costs and management time to get there) and 
				worst alternative (known as the WATNA) (viz. the amount it will 
				have to pay to the other side if it if it loses the case, the 
				amount it will have paid to its own lawyers in irrecoverable 
				legal costs, and costs paid to the successful side and wasted 
				management time). These devices focus the minds of the 
				disputants.<br>
				<br>
				Importantly, a trained mediator is a good listener and observer 
				of human behaviour and body language. There is often an issue 
				lying at the heart of a dispute which is not brought out in the 
				parties’ public pronouncements. Such underlying issues may be 
				very complex. However, mediators have often discovered that the 
				words “I’m sorry”, offered by one party to the other, can have 
				an instant ameliorating effect on the course of a dispute.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Conciliation</b><br>
				This is a more muscular form of mediation, where the mediator, 
				being experienced in the type of issues in dispute, is given 
				authority, in open session, to express his or her views on the 
				merits of positions adopted by the parties. This is generally 
				not done in classic mediation where, in private sessions only, a 
				mediator will force a party to reflect on the merits of its 
				position by asking carefully constructed questions.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Deadlock breaking</b><br>
				The parties may, however, agree to the mediator having 
				“evaluative” powers after a failed mediation. This can break 
				deadlocks. It involves the mediator, being experienced in the 
				issues in dispute, and having generally been provided with 
				documents and statements relating to the case, subsequently 
				expressing a non-binding view on the merits of the parties’ 
				respective positions. I have often seen a non-binding “early 
				neutral evaluation” of this sort to cause one party to soften 
				its subsequent negotiating stance, leading to resolution.<br>
				Another deadlock breaking mechanism involves the claimant 
				providing privately to the mediator the lowest amount it will 
				accept to settle the claim, and the respondent similarly 
				providing to the mediator the highest amount it would be 
				prepared to pay to settle the claim. The mediator will thereby 
				obtain a ready snapshot as to whether there is scope for 
				settlement, from which the mediator can communicate to each 
				party a proposed solution.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What if the parties are exhausted from mediation and simply 
				require a fast, no frills, binding determination?</b><br>
				For certain claims, and for those parties with an appetite for a 
				robust, fast-track ‘winner takes all’ approach, a respected 
				mediator, well informed about the technical and/or legal issues 
				in dispute, can be asked to decide which of the parties’ 
				announced positions say, on a money claim, is the more 
				reasonable in all the circumstances. The parties commit 
				themselves to accepting the determination. This is a known as 
				“baseball mediation”. Alternatively, the parties do not announce 
				their respective positions, but simply ask the expert to 
				determine what would be reasonable, and the party whose position 
				is the closer to the determination ‘wins the case’ (known as 
				“night baseball mediation!). If mediation fails, what are the 
				alternatives apart from Court? This question continues to be the 
				subject of particular interest in Omani business circles. <br>

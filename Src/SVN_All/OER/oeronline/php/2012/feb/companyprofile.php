				They say a rose would never sound that sweet with any other 
				name. When a name evolves into a brand, it gets imprinted in the 
				mind along with the entire legacy it represents. Therefore, it 
				will be difficult for values and standards which have grown and 
				became established along with a particular name to coexist with 
				a new name. <br>
				<br>
				That is why Sitco, one of the pioneers in office automation, 
				large format printing and bureau services in Oman, decided to 
				revoke its name change to Graphic International Centre for a 
				short stint and rechristen itself as Sitco. “The name Sitco 
				evokes nostalgia as we have been enjoying unblemished reputation 
				and goodwill in the market for three decades,” says V 
				Jayaprakash, managing director, Sitco. “It is a brand we 
				strongly embedded in the minds of the people in Oman as we were 
				one of the pioneers in office automation and bureau services 
				segment in the Sultanate. There was a strong demand from our 
				customers to go back to Sitco. They used to call us Sitco even 
				when we switched over to Graphic International Centre for a few 
				years.”<br>
				<br>
				Sitco is now reinventing its market ethos more confidently as an 
				independent organisation. It has a full-fledged branch in 
				Salalah and is also operating from Sohar. Established in 1983 as 
				an office automation company, Sitco has come of age as the 
				leading distributor of multi-function printers (MFPs), copiers, 
				scanners, laminators, binders, shredders, card printers, 
				projectors, and AV solutions. It represents in Oman world’s 
				leading equipment brands such as Rex Rotary (Photocopiers, 
				printers and MFPs), Optoma (projectors), Fellowes (shredders, 
				laminators and binding machines), Evolis (ID card printers), 
				Neolt (Paper cutters) and Olympia (shredders). Sitco is the sole 
				distributor of Domino, world’s leading coding and printing 
				solutions provider. It is also the regional distributor of 
				Sericol, the popular ink brand used in screen, narrow web and 
				digital printing applications. <br>
				<br>
				As a distributor of world-known brands, Sitco supports a number 
				of ministries, corporates and various crucial infrastructure and 
				development projects in the country . “We supply a number of 
				educational products to the Ministry of Education. We win big 
				tenders from the ministry because of its confidence in our 
				product line, the brand we support and the services we provide,” 
				says Vinil Praksh, product manager, Sitco. “The last 30 years of 
				our operation in the Sultanate bear testimony to the quality of 
				our products and the efficiency of our services. Our tag line 
				‘beyond businesses’ reflects how diligently and devotedly we 
				support our customers. We are there ready to serve them on a 
				24/7 basis.”<br>
				<br>
				Jayaprakash succinctly sums up this, “Right products, right 
				solution, at the right time.” Apart from various ministries and 
				petroleum companies including PDO, Sitco supports almost all 
				contractors of the new airport project, Omran’s exhibition 
				Centre and other local contractors and visiting consultants. 
				“What kept us abreast of the market is that the business 
				managers of our principals visit us every quarter and they meet 
				our major clients constantly. It helps us build confidence in 
				them and make them feel that their requirements are adhered to,” 
				says Haridasan Nair, operations manager.<br>
				<br>
				Jayaprakash says as a distributor of the latest educational 
				products to the Ministry of Education, Sitco feels proud to be 
				partners in the social development of the country. It is also 
				part of a social mission to keep the youth and the students 
				abreast of the latest technology and contribute to the 
				development of Oman’s human resources and technological 
				prowess.&#8194;<br>

				The outlook for Oman’s economy in 2012 is positive as the 
				government has announced a 12 per cent increase in spending, 
				based on oil price pegged at $75 a barrel and a daily production 
				of 920,000 barrels. Fiscal surplus is also anticipated in 2012 
				on the back of supportive oil prices. Indications are that 
				infrastructure projects will continue to give a fillip to the 
				economy in 2012 as part of the 8th Five-Year Plan strategy.<br>
				<br>
				The social sectors will also witness sustained focus with 
				increased allocation for education, health and social security, 
				leading to a balanced and healthy growth. The diversification of 
				the economy is proving beneficial in tackling risks emanating 
				from reliance on the oil and gas sector.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Creating jobs vital</b><br>
				Boosting exports, encouraging investment and devising a strategy 
				to expand productivity, as also controlling inflation, are 
				critical to sustaining growth in 2012. Priority will also need 
				to be given to creating jobs for Omanis, developing agriculture 
				and other non-oil sectors, especially small and medium 
				enterprises (SME), by encouraging the private sector to invest 
				in such projects. Attracting foreign investment is also equally 
				vital to record growth mainly in infrastructure, industry and 
				tourism sectors.<br>
				<br>
				In the banking sector, the proposed launching of Islamic banking 
				operations on the directive of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos will 
				contribute to the socio-economic development of Oman, heralding 
				the new era of Islamic financial intelligence in the growing 
				field of alternative banking and finance. The macro-economic 
				perspective to the practice of Islamic banking and finance will 
				lay an explicit emphasis on social responsibility, economic 
				justice and developmental concerns as also investment 
				opportunities.<br>

				I think, 2012 is going to be a year of continuing growth 
				particularly in our industry. We are at an inflection point in 
				telecommunication where data, which means broadband 
				communications, is just taking off. And so, we have already seen 
				a huge growth in 2011 and I can see an accelerated growth in 
				usage of broadband this year.<br>
				<br>
				We put in huge investments over the last few years in 
				infrastructure which is specifically for the broadband growth in 
				2012 and beyond. And I am confident that we will be able to grow 
				our customer usage considerably this year. I always say that 
				there are three areas of growth, broadband broadband, broadband, 
				like the real estate adage of location, location, location. 
				There is mobile broadband, home broadband and mobile broadband. 
				To give you a sense of the opportunity, the penetration in the 
				mobile broadband segment is just 25 per cent presently. By this, 
				I mean only 25 per cent of our customer base is using mobile 
				broadband and data. So that is a huge growth opportunity. If you 
				look at home broadband, if you look at the number of households 
				which have broadband at home, it is probably only about 70,000 
				out of the 550,000 customers as per the TRA figures. Over the 
				next few years it is a huge opportunity.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Again, the corporates have broadband but do they have 
				diversity?</b><br>
				<b><br>
				Cusp of growth</b><br>
				So I could say that the country is just on the cusp of growth of 
				broadband. And I think, this year is very exciting from that 
				point of view. There are a number of major projects all around 
				which employs nationals and expatriates and there is going to be 
				demand from them. We are working hard to satisfy their new 
				requirements.<br>
				<br>
				This is not an easy sailing though. The inflection point which I 
				was talking of is not an easy thing to understand. We still 
				trying to gauge how people use broadband. The fact is we are 
				trying to provide as many access points as possible. As you 
				know, we started with a mobile license, then we won the fixed 
				licensed as well. Now there are different types of access we can 
				provide – mobile, fibre to the business, wireless to the home 
				and now we have got the new wi-fi service. We are always trying 
				to make it simple for customers to move easily from one access 
				technology to another.<br>
				<br>
				There are challenges of course. We rolled out a lot of 
				technology but we need to communicate a lot more of what we are 
				doing. We just completed 6000 kms of coverage. This will create 
				a huge growth in reach towards customers.<br>
				<br>
				Upgrading our network capacity is also a challenge in the future 
				as we will have to keep up with the customers access demands and 
				also the speeds.&#8194;<br>

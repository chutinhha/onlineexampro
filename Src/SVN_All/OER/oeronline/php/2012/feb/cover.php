				In order to really understand the impact of Budget 2012, we need 
				to go back to October 2011 and the 7th Term 84-member Majlis 
				A’Shura. The members of this particular Shura took their office 
				armed with unprecedented legislative powers previously unheard 
				of. For instance, while their predecessors could only have a 
				look at the annual draft State General Budget, the 7th Term 
				Majlis A’Shura had the authority to not only glance but grant 
				approval for the 2012 Budget. This allowed the Shura members to 
				ensure that the government’s budgetary spendings were in line 
				with the demands of the citizens. Therefore every baiza spent by 
				the government in 2012 means that it has the implicit nod of the 
				people.<br>
				<br>
				Commenting on this, Ashok Hariharan, partner and head of Tax for 
				KPMG in Oman and the UAE, says, “It is important that people 
				look at the budget as one of the important tools to communicate 
				its plans for the progress of the country. What is equally 
				important is the efforts made by the government to bring in 
				reforms including legislative changes as demanded by today’s 
				generation wanting progress to take place at a fast pace.”<br>
				<br>
				“During 2011, we have seen amongst others, His Majesty’s 
				directives to allow Islamic Banking and the promulgation of the 
				new oil and gas law which addresses issues around concession 
				agreements, conservation of environment and also regulates the 
				natural gas sector. Changes introduced in the Labour Law and 
				legislative powers and authority given to the Council of Oman 
				mean that the government is now more responsible to its citizens 
				in all the actions it takes.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Balancing act</b><br>
				It is good to see that the government has carried out a 
				comprehensive review of the state of finances expected not only 
				for 2012 but also for the entire 8th Five Year Plan period. 
				Taking benefit of the prevailing oil prices, the government 
				revised upwards the planned development expenditure by 13 per 
				cent mainly to fund additional projects. Further, in response to 
				the social needs and financial decisions taken by the government 
				during 2011, the government has allocated additional funds 
				during the plan period for employment generation and improving 
				living standards.<br>
				<br>
				HE Darwish bin Ismail Al Balushi, Minister Responsible for 
				Financial Affairs, says, that the State General Budget (SGB) for 
				2012, has been prepared within the framework of the objectives 
				of the Eighth Five Year Plan and in harmony with the basic 
				principles stipulated in the financial framework of the plan.<br>
				<br>
				“Stabilisation of the macro-economy and preserving the public 
				finance balances and the gains achieved through the 
				comprehensive development by balancing the requirements of the 
				economic and social development and maintaining a growth rate of 
				7 per cent and inflation levels achieved in 2011 are the chief 
				objectives of the 2012 Budget,” HE Al Balushi said.<br>
				<br>
				Populist measures have been implemented while drafting the 
				budget as can be seen from the minister’s statement that social 
				dimension will be given special importance in a way that 
				complies with the development process and the aspirations of the 
				society through promoting spending on education, training, 
				employment, health, housing, water and improving the living 
				standards of nationals. The aim is to continue to implement the 
				economic diversification strategy and support the nonoil 
				productive sectors in a way that leads to the expansion of the 
				production base of the economy and create employment 
				opportunities for nationals.<br>
				<br>
				The government’s concern for social security and welfare can be 
				gauged by the fact that expenditure on this account is budgeted 
				to go up by 74 per cent compared to the original 2011 budget. 
				Further, the government’s spending on education is planned to go 
				up by 25 per cent in 2012 budget over the original 2011 budget 
				(see Chart 3). It is also interesting to note that the 
				government is reactivating the training for employment programme 
				which was in force a few years ago. Hopefully, the government 
				would have learnt from the challenges of the previous programmes 
				and would make sure that the training results in the direct 
				uplift of the skills of Omani nationals.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Estimates</b><br>
				The general revenues of the state for 2012 was estimated to be 
				RO8.8bn against RO7.3bn in the budget of the fiscal 2011, with 
				an increase of RO1.5bn, i.e. 21 per cent. The oil and gas 
				revenues constitute 82 per cent of the total revenues, whereas 
				the current and capital revenues constitute 18 per cent thereof 
				(See Chart 3). <br>
				<br>
				The oil revenues were calculated on the basis of average price 
				$75 per barrel and an average daily production of 915,000 
				barrels per day. The deficit is estimated to amount to RO1.2bn, 
				i.e. 50 per cent of the GDP and will be covered from funding 
				approved in the budget including the issuance of development 
				bonds to the domestic market amounting to RO200mn.<br>
				Important expenditure are in the social fields namely, for 
				education – RO1.3bn, (i.e. 13 per cent of total); health – 
				RO500mn (5 per cent); social security and welfare – RO130mn; 
				development budget – RO120mn for constructing 2500 housing 
				units; and subsidies – RO1.2bn (see Chart 5 for breakup of 
				investment expenditure).<br>
				<br>
				Further, the amended approbations of the Eighth Five Year 
				Development Plan (2011-2015) as at the end of November 2011 
				amounted to about RO13.7bn compared with the original 
				approbations amounting to RO12.1bn i.e. 13 per cent increase. 
				The total approbations allocated for the first and the second 
				years of the plan (2011 and 2012) and the projects continuing 
				from the Seventh Plan will amount to RO8.6bn, out of which 
				RO1.6bn is the cost of the new projects scheduled to be executed 
				in 2012. (See Chart 4).<br>
				<br>
				Says Hariharan, “The striking feature of Oman’s budget is the 
				fact that there are hardly any borrowings to finance the 
				expenditure. Whilst the 2012 budget allocates an amount of 
				RO300mn to fund the deficit of RO1.2bn, actual results of 
				previous years show that there is hardly any need to resort to 
				borrowings given the surplus generated. This is in sharp 
				contrast to the challenges faced globally and in particular by 
				the Euro Zone.”<br>
				<br>
				Whilst a deficit of RO1.2bn is budgeted, in reality it may be 
				far lower given that the budget is based on an oil price of $75 
				which is at least 25 per cent lower than the prevailing market 
				price, Hariharan predicts.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Beneficiaries</b><br>
				It is evident that the nationals and the residents of the 
				country will benefit from the government’s continued focus on 
				development and promotion of social security and welfare. The 
				private sector will also no doubt benefit from the significant 
				increase in the five-year planned development expenditure. 
				However there are divergent views when it comes to speaking 
				about the benefits of the budget.<br>
				<br>
				Dr Abdullah Al Salmi, Acting Executive President of Capital 
				Market Authority, says that although all the projects that have 
				been announced are good for the economy the government has to 
				evaluate them, and determine how much value addition is being 
				created by them. “We are spending on projects to get something 
				for our long term use. At the same time, the economy has to 
				benefit from these expenditures on a short term basis as well in 
				the form of returning some of these amounts into the local 
				economy. Since we know that some projects cannot be executed by 
				local companies, the foreign companies can be the general 
				contractor underneath whom we must have small contractors. These 
				big companies should transfer technology and knowhow so that in 
				the future the jobs can be done by the local companies,” opines 
				Dr Abdullah.<br>
				<br>
				Continuing further, he says, “This way we can start building 
				capacities among the local companies which will not only grow 
				but will be able to implement and execute these projects. 
				Employment will also be generated through the formation of new 
				local companies. Thus, a part of the revenues will remain in the 
				country.”<br>
				<br>
				Many industry leaders feel they need a proactive government with 
				a clear thrust on development which takes timely and appropriate 
				decisions to help private sector thrive and participate in 
				national development. While the private sector can bring in new 
				efficiencies and new technologies to make sure that Oman makes 
				rapid progress, the government should support certain areas like 
				the manufacturing sector which is expected to contribute 20 per 
				cent to the GDP by 2020.<br>
				<br>
				Hussain Salman Al Lawati, Vice Chairman and Managing Director, 
				Oman Cables Industry, says there are His Majesty’s instructions 
				and policies to support the local manufacturing industry. 
				However, just allocating RO100mn in the 2012 Budget for 
				development of new industrial zones cannot be called as support, 
				he says. “All countries including the developed one, gives 
				importance to their national industries while our neighboring 
				countries gives direct extensive price preference and support 
				for their national products,” says Hussain while adding, “In our 
				opinion, they should implement the common GCC agreement which 
				gives priority and preference to the local industry up to 5 per 
				cent to the GCC and 10 per cent to the international companies. 
				Instead of injecting loans into businesses, the government 
				should inject money into the companies. This way, they can 
				convert the capacity to productivity.”<br>
				<br>
				“With the amendments in the labour law, the costs have gone up. 
				Unfortunately, the manufacturing sector has taken the maximum 
				hit as compared to other sectors like trading, services etc. It 
				is important that for the officials in the Government to recall 
				that manufacturing industry employs extensively and can create 
				more opportunities for the Omanis to join. While presently 
				manufacturing industry employs more than 15000 Omani employees 
				and therefore it is important that the Government must provide 
				the support to local industries to get business,” adds Hussain.<p align="right" class="style13" dir="ltr">

<b>The growing incidence of foreign participation on the MSM has started to have 
a bearing on the stock market. Mayank Singh reports</b><br>
<br>
Foreign (non-GCC and non-Arab) shareholding on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) 
has steadily grown from 6.7 per cent in 2005 to 10.1 per cent in 2006 to 11.98 
per cent in 2007. Foreign shareholding on the MSM 30 index for this year stands 
at 17.44 per cent. According to the latest figures from MSM, the number of 
foreigners investing on the MSM stood at 9,515 in April 2008.<br>
<img border="0" src="investor_participation.jpg" width="200" height="225" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="8"><br>
Though GCC participation on the MSM has been happening since 2003, investments 
by FIIs (foreign institutional investors) and foreign portfolio investors from 
Europe and the US is a relatively new trend. Says Hari Varma, vice president, 
research, Vision Securities, “The Galfar listing saw a lot of participation from 
FIIs and the trend has strengthened subsequently. Large global funds like 
Goldman Sachs and Franklin Templeton have started taking positions on the MSM.” 
Market sources state that Algebra Capital in the UAE, which manages three 
Franklin Templeton funds has been given the mandate to invest a certain part of 
these funds on the MSM. <br>
<br>
Prime drivers <br>
The 62 per cent and 14.1 per cent return given by the MSM in 2007 and 2006, 
respectively, has been instrumental in attracting foreign investors. Says V 
Gowribalan, vice president–asset management, Fincorp, “In 2006, when almost all 
the markets in the region were down, MSM was the only stock market that gave a 
good return. It followed this up in 2007 by becoming the best performing index 
in the world, forcing foreign investors to take note.” <br>
<br>
Apart from Galfar, frontline stocks like Raysut Cement, Oman Cables Industry, 
Omantel and BankMuscat have attracted foreign portfolio investment lately. <br>
<br>
The increasing liquidity and depth of shares is another factor giving a fillip 
to foreign portfolio investment. There are times when a large fund like Merrill 
Lynch or Goldman Sachs demand market capitalisation criteria before taking a 
call. “They may invest only in shares, which have a market capitalisation of 
US$100 million and above. Today, there are 10-15 companies on the MSM, which 
have a market capitalisation of US$100 million making the exchange more 
attractive,” says Varma. <br>
<br>
If market capitalisation is a criteria for some, others may come in simply lured 
by the prospect of good returns. Says Gowribalan, “Most foreigners initially 
take speculative positions of one-and-a-half years as compared to value 
investors, who may remain invested for five to six years.” As a rule of thumb, 
foreign funds usually come into markets like Oman through another regional fund. 
On the regulatory side, a foreign fund needs a membership on the local bourse 
and a custodian to take care of its shares. Once these two are in place, a 
foreign player can start trading on the MSM. <br>
<br>
<b>Risk quotient</b><br>
As foreign investments increase there are concerns about the sudden flight of 
capital. Most analysts, however, discount this possibility. “It is unlikely that 
this will happen. In January, when there was a global meltdown in the wake of 
the sub-prime crisis, the MSM fell by 8 per cent in one day. But the index 
recovered immediately the next day proving its resilience,” says Hari. <br>
While this may not pose an immediate issue, there are chances that large foreign 
participation may create other problems. “As these are large players, they mop 
up a lot of free float of a share and these go into safe custody. If these get 
offloaded in one go, it can create a lot of volatility,” says Gowribalan. The 
introduction of hedging mechanisms like derivatives and a bond market will add 
to foreign participation on the MSM. With foreign portfolio investment bringing 
in large sums of fresh capital, such a trend is sure to add depth to the local 
stock market. </font></p>

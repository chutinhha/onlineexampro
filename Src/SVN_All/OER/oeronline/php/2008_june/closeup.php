<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Linking economic progress between Qatar, 
Bahrain<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<br>
<b>With the economies of Qatar and Bahrain heading towards raPid development, the 
proposed 40-km causeway between the two countries will keep the momentum going</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>
In May, Qatar and Bahrain took some concrete steps to integrate their economies. 
In particular, the two countries made notable headway by sealing a deal to 
develop a causeway linking the northwestern region of Qatar with the 
southeastern area of Bahrain.<br>
<br>
Also, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a joint 
insurance firm based on Islamic principles, apart from agreeing to strengthen 
cooperation in the tourism sector. All these developments took place during the 
8th session of the joint Bahraini-Qatari Supreme Co-operation Committee held in 
Manama. The Crown Princes of Bahrain and Qatar co-chair the committee.<br>
<b><br>
The causeway deal</b><br>
Undoubtedly, the most important progress relates to the signing of an accord 
between the Qatar-Bahrain Causeway Foundation and Vinci Construction of France 
to construct the 40-km causeway. The French firm leads a consortium of five 
companies mandated to construct the project. <br>
<br>
Only a few details of the deal are currently available, though actual 
construction is likely to start towards year-end, with completion projected in 
2013. Still, there are no hard facts regarding actual cost of the ambitious 
project. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the price tag would hover around 
US$3 billion. The actual bill, however, could end up being higher due to 
inflationary pressures in the region. The deal carries notable advantages to 
firms and nationals of both Qatar and Bahrain. The accord dictates that Qatari 
and Bahraini concerns should be assigned sub-contracts wherever possible.<br>
Additionally, the deal calls for granting engineering students from both Qatar 
and Bahrain the opportunity to get hands-on experience during the implementation 
stage. The unique stipulation deserves to be complimented.<br>
<b><br>
Economic gains</b><br>
The link should bring economic benefits to both nations, but particularly to 
Bahrain. Benefits include invigorating local economies, strengthening trade 
relations and enhancing integration among Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), 
which include Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.<br>
<br>
Certainly, local economies of both countries stand to benefit from spending on 
the project. Each country is scheduled to spend some US$1.5 billion over a span 
of five years, the period in which the project will be executed. Undoubtedly, 
the gross domestic product (GDP) of both countries should benefit from this, as 
the funds will find their way to different contractors. Then, there is the 
multiplier effect. Traditionally, each dollar spent generates more than three 
dollars in the economies of both Qatar and Bahrain. Thus, there is likely to be 
considerable spillover effects.<br>
<br>
With a GDP of about $16 billion, Bahrain’s economy stands to benefit the most 
from the link, as the causeway will provide easy access to one of the region’s 
fastest growing economies. Qatar’s economy is doubling once every five years and 
its GDP is three times that of Bahrain. Qatar’s economy reportedly grew by 10 
per cent in real terms in 2007, after an inflation adjustment that averaged 
around 14 per cent.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="close_up2.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="200" height="111"><b>Bilateral trade</b><br>
The link will certainly assist in increasing the level of bilateral trade. The 
two-way trade figure amounted to $162 million in 2007, with Bahrain enjoying a 
trade surplus. The value of Bahraini exports amounted to $123 million. This is a 
sizable amount as it comprises more than 5 per cent of Bahrain’s non-oil 
exports.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the causeway should open up prospects for further trade by making it 
easy for enterprises to engage in trading activities. Already, there are talks 
of Qatar’s industrial undertakings, in sectors such as steel, finding easier 
ways to reach the Bahraini market. Chances are that Qatar will be able to bridge 
the trade gap with Bahrain once the causeway becomes operational.<br>
<br>
Among other areas, Bahrain’s financial services sector should make gains from 
having easy access to Qatari nationals, who in turn are enjoying one of the 
highest per capita incomes in the world. By one account, Qatar ranks No. 6 
worldwide in per capita income after only a handful of countries, including 
Luxembourg and Switzerland. Per capita income in Qatar has reportedly crossed 
the level of $50,000 per annum. Undoubtedly, many financial institutions 
operating in Bahrain would like to sell their products to well-to-do Qatari 
nationals, notably those products that comply with Islamic teachings.<br>
Jobs for Bahrainis<br>
<br>
Improved trade relations help in keeping some jobs as well as in creating new 
ones. The link can provide a venue for Bahraini nationals exploring employment 
opportunities in Qatar as they have the advantage of sharing a common culture. 
Bahrain today faces an acute unemployment problem with the rate of unemployment 
being no less than 8 per cent. Qatar, on the other hand, needs qualified 
workers.<br>
<b><br>
GCC success</b><br>
Above all, the causeway link falls in line with the broader goal of achieving 
economic integration within the GCC, which started the common market project at 
the beginning of 2008 that necessitates granting unrestricted access to member 
states.<br>
<br>
Implementation of the Gulf Common Market (GCM) commenced in January 2008. The 
GCM aims at finding a unified market through which nationals will benefit from 
available opportunities. The ambitious project covers all economic and 
investment services, dealings in the stock market and setting up of companies in 
the public and private sectors besides social insurance among GCC citizens.<br>
<br>
The GCM allows for free movement of factors of production amongst member states. 
In practice, therefore, the deals signed by Qatar and Bahrain represent the 
actual execution of GCM objectives. </font></p>

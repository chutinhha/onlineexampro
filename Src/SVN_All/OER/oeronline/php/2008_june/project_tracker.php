<b>Oman Wastewater Services Company is setting up a modern wastewater system in 
Muscat Governorate with an investment of RO1.2 billion. Akshay Bhatnagar takes a 
look at the progress made so far on the project, which is expected to be 
completed by 2017<br>
</b><br>
<br>
The gruesome sight of an overflowing septic tank or a tanker sucking out waste 
from sewage lines at regular intervals in Muscat is expected to be a thing of 
the past in coming years. Thanks to the efforts of the state-owned Oman 
Wastewater Services Company (OWSC) that is spearheading the ‘Muscat Wastewater 
Project’ to build and operate a modern wastewater system in all the wilayats of 
Muscat Governorate. With a combined investment of RO 1.2 billion (at current 
prices), the project will cover 30,000 plots spread across the Governorate to 
reach 90 per cent of the population by 2017.<br>
<br>
<b>Project Scope<img border="0" src="wastewater2.jpg" width="187" height="145" align="right"></b><br>
The Muscat Wastewater Project involves building wastewater networks, pumping 
stations and sewage treatment plants. The treated water may not be fit for 
consumption but it will be good enough for irrigation and industrial 
applications. The treated effluents produced by OWSC will be used for 
irrigation. OWSC is also planning to produce fertilizers using the waste churned 
out by the sewage treatment plants (STP). The company is currently in the 
process of implementing the Bausher wastewater project that consists of an STP 
in Al-Ansab. Based on the membrane Reactor System, the STP will produce 53,000 
m3 of treated water per day. Galfar Engineering &amp; Contracting Co. has undertaken 
construction work for the STP. Simultaneously, OWSC is constructing sewage 
networks in Bausher covering areas from Al-Hamriya roundabout to Al Azaiba. The 
total length of the network will be 300-km and will connect 18,000 plots. The 
Chinese company Sinohydro has been assigned the construction of the sewage 
networks in Al-Ghubra and Al Azaiba. The same company is also buildinq g the 
central pumping station in Al Azaiba.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="wastewater3.jpg" width="200" height="194" align="left">In the Seeb wastewater project, the company is building a sewage treatment plant 
with a capacity of 80,000 m3 treated water per day. Three pumping stations will 
also be constructed to push the wastewater coming from different parts of Al-Seeb 
to the main collector sewer. A 25-km long main collector sewer will be 
constructed that will run parallel to Sultan Qaboos highway from the Airport 
Height road to the STP at Al-Seeb. A 270-km long sewage collection network will 
be constructed in the coastal strip north of Sultan Qaboos highway. Ten vacuum 
stations will also be built to suck out the wastewater and transfer it to the 
main treatment plant.<br>
<br>
<br>
OWSC is also busy planning sewage networks in Al-Mabella (170-km long) and Al-Khoud 
(270-km long) using the gravity system. The company recently awarded two related 
contracts – Al Maabela Gravity Drainage Network to Arab Contractors, and Al Seeb 
Costal Strip Vacuum Sewers Networks to Galfar – with a combined value of over 
RO145 million.<br>
<br>
<b>New Tenders</b><br>
Speaking to OER, OWSC’s CEO, Omar bin Khalfan Al-Wahaibi said, “We’re planning 
to float at least five more tenders this year. The combined construction value 
of these tenders is expected to be around RO250 million”. On the Bausher sewage 
network, OWSC will float three tenders for the main assembly line coming out of 
Al-Ghubra up to Wadi Adai, the sewage networks in Al-Khuwair, Al Qurum and 
Madinat Al-Aalam. <br>
<br>
<b>No mean feat</b><br>
Creating a wastewater system for a city that is growing at a rapid pace is not 
an easy task. The non-availability of updated sub-surface information from a 
centralised source is another issue that the officials of OWSC and its 
contractors are grappling with. “On the existing underground networks, we 
collect information from all the relevant authorities to ensure that while 
digging we don’t damage infrastructure related to telephone cables, oil 
pipelines, water network, electricity cables etc. But often we find elements 
that are not provided by the relevant authorities. That leads to alteration in 
the original plan and unwarranted delay in the execution of the project,” said 
Samir Abo Humaid, project manager, OWSC.<br>
<br>
In order to ensure that digging of the surface doesn’t affect the networks of 
other companies, OWSC has deployed ‘micro tunneling’ technology. “We are using a 
remotely controlled Microtunnel Boring Machine (MTBM) combined with the pipe 
jacking technique to directly install pipelines underground in a single pass. 
This process avoids the need to have long stretches of open trench for pipe 
laying, which causes extreme disruption to the community. It is currently the 
most accurate pipeline installation method. Line and grade tolerances of one 
inch are the micro tunneling industry standard. This can be extremely important 
when trying to install a new pipeline in an area where a maze of underground 
utility lines already exists,” Humaid said. </font></p>

		Kuwait’s Burgan Bank is expected to buy the holdings of Bahrain-based 
		United Gulf Bank (UBG). The deal worth US$727 million covers the bank’s 
		four regional operations and is expected to be closed this month. The 
		transaction will see 200 million shares being issued by Burgan Bank.<br>
		<br>
		Both banks are subsidiaries of the oil-rich emirate’s giant holding firm 
		Kuwait Projects Company (KIPCO). The UGB operations to be acquired 
		include Algeria Gulf Bank, Bank of Baghdad, Jordan Kuwait Bank and Tunis 
		International Bank.<br>

		by non-residential property deals, according to official data, despite 
		government vows to bring down property prices to tackle record 
		inflation.<br>
		<br>
		Inflation jumped to a record of 9.5 per cent in January driven mainly by 
		a 16.1 per cent rise in housing costs. The value of all real estate 
		deals-including residential, investment and commercial property-rose to 
		around KD277.4 million (US$1.04 billion) in March compared to KD240.5 
		million dinars a year ago, government data obtained by Reuters showed.<br>
		<br>
		Residential sales, the biggest part of the real estate business, rose to 
		KD143.46 million in March compared to KD140.53 million in the same month 
		last year. Commercial property jumped 165 per cent to KD35.34 million, 
		while investment property rose around 13.74 per cent to KD98.56 million. 
		The total number of deals fell to 873 in March from 1,065 a year 
		earlier, the data showed. <br>
		<br>
		The central bank urged the government last week to tackle record 
		inflation by giving away more land to citizens. The government said in 
		February that it raised subsidies on building materials such as steel 
		and cement. More than 90 per cent of land is owned by the government.<br>

		Saudis are queuing up to blast off into outer space as the country’s 
		fledgling space tourism industry takes wing. According to sources at 
		Virgin Galactic, Saudi tourists are eager about taking a vacation in 
		space.<br>
		<br>
		“We have had a very strong response from travel agents at ATM, with 
		particularly strong interest from Saudi Arabia. Several agencies from 
		the kingdom have approached me to indicate their interest, plus agencies 
		from Kuwait, Doha and Qatar,” said Sharon Garrett, head of space 
		marketing at Virgin Galactic’s UAE agent Sharaf Travel. The company’s 
		flights commence in June next year and tickets carry a hefty tag of 
		US$200,000 per ticket. Virgin Galactic has already sold over 200 tickets 
		globally, representing over US$30 million in deposits.<br>

		<b>Saudi ‘not yet ready to open up’</b><br>
		Saudi Arabia is not quite ready to fully open up to visitors despite 
		welcoming its first cruise passengers to Jeddah last month, according to 
		a tourism official. “Realistically, we are just at the start of the 
		creation of the service side of tourism, as well as infrastructure, and 
		we want to be in good shape first,” Saudi Commission for Tourism and 
		Antiquities (SCTA) Secretary General, Prince Sultan bin Salman bin 
		Abdulaziz Al-Saud said.<br>
		<br>
		The commission will place renewed emphasis on promoting the country’s 
		domestic tourism sector, and its foremost challenge will be to attract 
		the local audience, five million of whom vacation overseas each year. 
		Domestic tourism is predicted to soar to 73.3 billion riyals (US$19.5 
		billion) in 2010 and 101.3 billion riyals in 2020, according to a recent 
		report by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). There are also 
		measures in the offing to streamline annual vacations that give people 
		shorter holidays. The commission also plans to provide seed capital to 
		event organisers to create MICE attractions in the kingdom in a bid to 
		drive demand. Other recent developments include the classification of 
		hotels, which has already begun in Mecca and Medina, with a major study 
		underway to research the possible expansion of a heritage inn chain 
		similar to the ‘parador’ system in Spain.<br>

		special appeal as a family getaway have been brought sharply into focus 
		by the Rosewood Corniche. The luxury hotel aims to extend Jeddah’s 
		appeal for leisure breaks to other parts of the GCC. Earlier this year 
		the hotel launched two-night weekend packages to attract families and 
		couples from Riyadh and the Eastern Province. Among the many reasons it 
		stands out is the fact that it offers Saudi Arabia’s first dedicated 
		Ladies’ Floor, reserved exclusively for female travellers. Here, female 
		butlers pack and unpack ladies’ luggage, provide information about the 
		city’s facilities for women and help ensure the complete comfort of 
		female visitors. Each of the 127 luxurious guest rooms and suites offer 
		majestic views of the Red Sea and often-incredible sunsets, and 
		Rosewood’s unrivalled 24-hour butler service is available to all guests, 
		as are the latest entertainment and business solutions. </font></p>

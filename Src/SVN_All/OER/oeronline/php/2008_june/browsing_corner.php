<img border="0" src="BrowsingCorner.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="90" height="150" hspace="5">The most significant figure in Japanese history, as far as the Japanese 
		are concerned, is Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-1598). Even in his lifetime 
		he was considered one of the greatest of the Japanese, and he was made a 
		Shinto deity shortly after his death and given the title, Hokoku, or 
		“Wealth of the Nation.”<br>
		<br>
		He began in the most obscure circumstances. He was born of no traceable 
		samurai lineage, the son of a peasant-warrior named Yaemon, and rose to 
		become the complete master of Japan by 1590. Hideyoshi had no last name 
		when he began to serve Oda Nobunaga; by the end of his life, he had 
		assumed the family name, Toyotomi, or “Abundant Provider.”<br>
		During his childhood, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had the nickname Saru, meaning 
		“monkey,” because he was known to act foolishly and climb trees. As he 
		grew up, he attained higher rank, which required him to change his name. 
		Many legends describe Hideyoshi being sent to study at a temple as a 
		young man, but he rejected temple life and went in search of adventure. 
		He started as a servant to local ruler Matsushita Kahei. He traveled all 
		the way to the lands of Imagawa Yoshimoto, daimyo of Suruga Province, 
		and served there for a time, only to abscond with a sum of money 
		entrusted to him by Matsushita Yukitsuna.<br>
		<br>
		At the start of his biography he joined the Oda clan, headed by Oda 
		Nobunaga, as a lowly servant. He became one of Nobunaga’s sandal-bearers 
		and was present at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560 when Nobunaga 
		defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto, to become one of the most powerful warlords 
		in the Sengoku period. Oda Nobunaga attempted to unify Japan through 
		sheer brute force; Hideyoshi furthered this endeavor by concentrating on 
		the arts of peace and administration, Oda had done, you might say, all 
		the dirty work and it was left to Hideyoshi to forge a new 
		administrative organization to guarantee unification. <br>
		<br>
		Hideyoshi applied uncanny methods to the task. He was very successful as 
		a negotiator. By 1590, with Nobunaga’s death, he was the undisputed 
		master of Japan. The government that he built was founded on the old 
		feudal system of personal loyalties rather than administrative 
		centrality. While he pacified the country, he did not fundamentally 
		change the Japanese way of national life. Most of the measures that 
		Hideyoshi employed were instrumental in the long period of domestic 
		quiet. <br>
		In The Swordless Samurai, translated from the original Japanese, Tim 
		Clark has given due importance to the simplicity of expression of the 
		leadership concepts in Hideyoshi’s original. There is a conspicuous 
		absence of the jargon we read in contemporary exposes these days. Just 
		45 secrets, all applied by Hideyoshi to achieve various feats. Some of 
		them simple logic; others the application of calculative strategy. The 
		strategies take the reader through distinguishing oneself, succeeding at 
		the impossible, crisis management, motivation, rewarding, and building 
		an organisation. The whole sequence is spread across nine chapters, each 
		eminently readable for its anecdotal strength.<br>
		<br>
		After taking the reader through invigorating lessons on how to succeed, 
		the 10th chapter seems to hint at the reason why the stability of the 
		Toyotomi dynasty after Hideyoshi’s death was put in doubt. With the 
		death of his only son Tsurumatsu, Hideyoshi named his nephew Hidetsugu 
		his heir after officially adopting him. Hideyoshi resigned as kampaku to 
		take the title of taik&#333; (retired regent). Hidetsugu succeeded him as 
		kampaku.<br>
		<br>
		The last chapter is all about the failure of leadership, and almost 
		confesses to Hideyoshi’s weaknesses. He himself succumbed to the 
		pleasures of power. Seemed like an anti-climax to a long story of 
		achievements.</font></p>

Al Khoudh Steel Furniture Industrial Company has started recycling raw 
materials. Shop floor workers who used to throw away a mother sheet after 
cutting an almirah door have started recycling the remaining portion for other 
furniture improving usage. <br>
<br>
If you thought that Naranjee Hirjee has become a neo convert to kaizen or that 
Al Khoudh has started following the six sigma principle, think again. These new 
found efficiencies are measures to combat a monetary phenomenon – growing 
inflation. And they are not alone in this drive as the malaise is forcing a 
number of companies to tighten their belts.<br>
<br>
Says Ajit Limaye, projects director, Al Turki Enterprises, “There are five M’s 
adding to our cost of processing – namely manpower, materials, machinery, money 
supply and management.” Limaye is not being merely alliterative but is echoing a 
serious concern facing corporate Oman.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="inflation_in_oman.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="332" height="349"><b>Growing concern</b><br>
A break-up of the numbers reflects the gravity of the situation – annual 
inflation in Oman accelerated to 11.56 per cent in March 2008 up from 11.11 per 
cent in February, an 18 year high. Oman is not the only country in the region to 
be affected by the problem. In Saudi Arabia inflation is at a 16-year high and 
in neighbouring UAE it has touched a 19-year peak.<br>
<br>
The Sultanate’s consumer price index hit a new high of 120.6 points at the end 
of March 2008 according to Ministry of National Economy estimates, compared to 
108.10 points a year earlier. The first-quarter costs for food, beverage and 
tobacco – which make up almost a third of the consumer price index – surged 18.5 
per cent compared to March 2007 and rents are up by 12.4 per cent. The price 
rise has not only been eating into the purchasing power of the lower and middle 
class populace but has also started shaving off profits of companies across 
sectors in Oman.<br>
<br>
The fact that a number of factors feeding inflation are beyond the control of 
the Sultanate’s market (or government) makes the situation far worse.<br>
<br>
<b>Prime drivers</b><br>
<img border="0" src="vaiyda.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="92" height="121">A sharp rise in international commodity prices is proving to be a heavy burden 
for manufacturing and construction companies. Iron ore prices have shot up from 
$77.35 per dmtu (dry metric tonne unit) in 2006 to $140.60 per dmtu in Jan-Feb 
2008. Aluminium is up from $2,570 per metric tonne in 2006 to $2,611 in Jan-Feb 
2008. The price of cement has gone up by 30 per cent over the last two years.<br>
<br>
Says Gautam Bose, general manager, Al Khoudh Steel, “A tightness of supply 
compared to demand due to a consolidation of the steel industry has changed the 
nature of the industry.” Mergers like Mittal Steel and Arcelor have made the 
steel industry more oligopolistic, reducing the bargaining power of individual 
companies. “Since our import volumes are small the bargaining power of companies 
in Oman is insignificant,” says Bose.<br>
<br>
Growing steel prices have had a cascading effect on construction costs. It has 
also led to an increase in the cost of machinery such as excavators, tipper 
trucks and graders. So an excavator which cost RO55,000 in 2006 is now priced at 
RO75,000. Companies, on their part, cannot postpone these purchases as they have 
to execute a growing order book fuelled by the growth in infrastructure 
spending.<br>
Transportation costs<br>
With oil prices breaching new highs by the month (the latest being the $130 plus 
per barrel mark), there has been an across- the-board increase in production and 
transportation costs. Says Limaye, “As long as energy prices keep rising there 
will be no letting up in the inflationary engine.”<br>
<br>
Freight costs have gone up on an average by 20 per cent over the last year. A 
mismatch in the supply and demand of shipping vessels makes matters worse. As 
the demand for vessels from the Far East go up (fuelled by rapid economic growth 
in China and India) there are less number of vessels to service this increased 
demand as shipping companies have traditionally concentrated on Europe and the 
US. “A rise in the handling fee of shipping agents and CNF (carrying and 
forwarding) rates in Dubai and Saudi Arabia have pushed up our costs,” says H F 
Bilimoria, group general manager, Naranjee Hirjee. <br>
<br>
<b>Servicing manpower costs</b><br>
According to the Muscat Consumer Price index, the cost of food, beverages and 
tobacco in the capital region has increased by 16.8 per cent between January – 
February 2007 and the corresponding period this year. Rent, electricity, water 
and fuel costs are up by 11.5 per cent. And the general price index is up by 10 
per cent.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gautam.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="94" height="121">As the cost of living goes up in the Sultanate most companies are being forced 
to pay more to retain their employees. The opening up of new opportunities and 
changes in the regulatory norms allowing employees to shift jobs is also forcing 
companies to spend more.<br>
<br>
The government showed the way by announcing a salary increase of seven to 43 per 
cent for its employees in 2007. Most companies have followed the government’s 
lead and increased staff salaries. To cite a few examples – Oman Cables 
Industry’s (OCI) HR costs went up by 25 per cent in 2007 while Al Turki’s wage 
bill is up by 20 per cent. Says M M Vaidya, general manager (commercial) OCI, 
“The HR challenge is a small thing that is having a big impact.”<br>
<br>
However, pay hikes address just one part of the problem. “Attracting talent to 
the manufacturing sector is difficult as it is not seen as a happening sector. 
Secondly, most people who come on board take at least one year to learn the 
ropes before they start contributing in a meaningful way,” says Vaidya. This 
makes the cost of selecting and retaining people in such an industry an 
expensive proposition. Employing new people on higher salaries forces companies 
to increase the salaries of their existing staff to maintain parity, which in 
turns adds to their wage bill.<br>
<br>
With India’s economy growing at close to nine per cent per annumn it is getting 
increasingly difficult to attract people from the subcontinent – the traditional 
market from where most companies have been recruiting in the past. This has 
added to the woes of local companies. The enhanced spending on infrastructure 
within Gulf countries has intensified the competition for locally available 
talent making matters worse. Says Limaye, “We are paying 20 per cent more for 
people who are half as talented as before. And with people changing jobs 
frequently there are times when we feel that we are running a huge training 
centre.”<br>
<br>
<b>It’s all about the money</b><br>
A depreciating dollar has led to a decline in the purchasing power of local 
currencies in the GCC as most of them have dollar pegged currencies. In the last 
three years the dollar has declined by 25 per cent against the Euro, nine per 
cent against the Yen and 19-20 per cent against the Pound Sterling. Says Dr 
Sohail Issa Magableh, economic advisor, Directorate General of Research and 
Development, Capital Market Authority, “The depreciation in the local currency 
coupled with the influx of petrodollars due to increased oil prices are the two 
main reasons contributing to inflation in Oman.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="worldwide_commodity_prices.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="200" height="315">The erosion of the value of the dollar is forcing companies to pay more for 
importing goods. For example if the dollar has weakened by over 10 per cent 
against the Euro in the last one year or so, companies importing food products 
or industrial goods from Europe have been forced to foot this additional ten per 
cent cost. Says C K Khanna general manager, corporate, Bahwan Engineering 
Company, “We have been doubly hit as not only have the prices of equipment and 
construction materials gone up, but we are also being forced to pay more on 
account of the change in exchange rates.”<br>
<br>
Given this scenario there have been suggestions about revaluing or de-linking 
the Rial from the US dollar. The lead taken by countries like Kuwait and Syria 
to de-link their currencies from the US dollar in 2007 has added weight to such 
an argument.<br>
<br>
The government, on its part, has categorically denied any such corrective 
action. A Central Bank of Oman (CBO) document titled, ‘Inflation Concern and 
Policy Options’ prepared by the Central Bank of Oman states, ‘The fixed peg of 
the RO to the USD has certainly been one of the sources of imported inflation, 
but neither revaluation, nor any alternative exchange rate regime could be 
helpful in addressing the inflation concern, particularly as the external and 
supply side sources of inflation continue to persist…For a small economy, 
stability of exchange rate is critical for growth and investment and a 
revaluation option could entail more costs than the inflation related marginal 
benefits.’<br>
This document rules out any possibility of a revaluation of the Omani Rial and 
puts the onus back on companies to shoulder the burden of a declining dollar.<br>
<br>
On the demand side, the two factors fuelling inflation are the strong fiscal 
expansion due to favourable oil prices and a concurrent growth in money supply 
and credit. The value of oil exports from the GCC region reached close to $700bn 
in 2007 giving it a four per cent share of world exports. This cash flow has 
engendered its own problems of plenty.<br>
<br>
<b>Corrrective measures</b><br>
<img border="0" src="ramakkrishnan.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="94" height="121">Taking cognisance of the problem the government has initiated a number of policy 
measures. In an effort to control the increased money supply the CBO has 
increased the reserve requirement for banks from three to five per cent in 
February 2008. This is expected to take out RO140mn from the banking system thus 
curbing the ability of banks to lend and finance aggregate demand in the system. 
CBO has also been mopping up money through certificate of deposits (CDs). The 
amount collected through CBO CDs has gone up from about RO500mn at the end of 
October 2007 to around RO1,341mn in February 2008.<br>
<br>
Says Ali Hamdan Al-Raisi, senior manager, economic research and statistics, CBO, 
“The credit growth in the economy between March 2006-07 has been to the tune of 
46 per cent, while the economy has grown by over 12 per cent. This shows that a 
lot of credit is going in for speculation or into unproductive sectors.”<br>
<br>
The government has been making efforts to contain spiralling rents. It 
introduced regulatory norms like a 15 per cent ceiling on rent increases for a 
two-year period in 2007. As landlords found ways to bypass the legislation, a 
committee was formed under H E Saif bin Mohammed al Shabibi, the Minister of 
Housing to suggest further measures to ameliorate the situation.<br>
<br>
The committee has suggested a number of amendments such as non eviction of 
tenants for three years for residential property and seven years for a 
commercial property. It has also recommended a seven per cent annual cap on 
rents. Once implemented these measures are sure to bring a degree of comfort to 
beleaguered companies and their employees.<br>
<br>
<b>Changing mores</b><br>
Companies, on their part, are also working to make the best of a bad bargain. 
Says Raisi, “The total factor of productivity in Gulf countries is very low. 
Most companies are not raising productivity by training, education or the 
application of technology but merely by adding more labour.” While this charge 
may have a ring of truth, the onslaught of inflation is forcing companies to 
improve work processes. Most companies have started working on a two pronged 
process – lowering the cost of operations and bringing in new efficiencies.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="bilimoria.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="90" height="121">Al Khoudh Steel has embarked on a value engineering process to combat rising 
prices. Says Bose, “Value engineering is a process by which we redesign a 
product in such a manner that it does not deteriorate its functionality while 
reducing its costs.” One way of doing this is through automation or industrial 
engineering. The process improves throughput and reduces the rejection rate for 
products. To cite an example – Al Khoudh has started packaging two tables in a 
packaging carton in place of one. Since most orders are in multiples of 10s or 
20s, the costs of packaging have come down as a result.<br>
<br>
To bring about more efficient utilisation of space, the size of the racks on 
which the final products are stored have been reduced. “These racks were 
oversized compared to the height of the products, so the top racks were always 
lying empty. We cut short the size of the racks which has enabled us to mount 
more racks per square metre,” says Bose.<br>
<br>
Al Turki has been working on streamlining its forecasting process. Says Limaye, 
“We are working on anticipating the rise in prices so that our risk estimates 
get refined.” The company is also upgrading its IT infrastructure by 
implementing SAP and other software’s like Primera V6. Online recruitment 
software helps Limaye to see peoples CV’s online and respond to them.<br>

<font face="Verdana" size="1">OCI too has gone in for an ERP system (Baan) which is helping it to bring down 
its input costs. The company is exploring the option of going into sectors like 
oil and gas where the price realisation is better. The company was approved as a 
supplier by Shell global in 2007.<br>
<br>
OCI is also in favour of popularising benchmarks for commodities such as steel 
and aluminium so that it can pass on the costs to the consumer. Says P R 
Ramakrishnan, general manager (sales and marketing), OCI, “The customer is ready 
to pay for the rise in copper prices because there are internationally 
recognised benchmarks for it. There is a need to popularise such benchmarks for 
other commodities like steel, aluminium etc.”<br>
<br>
<b>A rogue phenomenon</b><br>
<img border="0" src="alihamdan.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="93" height="121">The imperative to control inflation can hardly be overstated. Rising prices can 
lead to investment uncertainty as companies and individuals may hold back 
investments if they cannot get a fix on the cost escalation that they may have 
to incur in future. “We do not want to take on long projects as it is difficult 
to know what the price of inputs is going to be over the next five years,” says 
a CEO of a construction company. Entrenched inflation can impact FDI (foreign 
direct investment) adversely. <br>
<br>
Taking note of the rising incidence of inflation in the Gulf, the International 
Monetary Fund has suggested that Gulf countries slow down the pace of their 
development by calling off a few large projects. The fund feels that a slowing 
down will ease inflationary pressures.<br>
<br>
Like other states in the region Oman’s economy has been riding the crest of a 
six-fold oil price rise in the last six years. The sultanate’s economy expanded 
to RO15.51bn ($40.29 billion) in 2007. Says Magableh, “A reduction in the rate 
of economic growth in some economies is very important as the current pace of 
economic growth is leading to undesirable effects.”<br>
<br>
His viewpoint, however, is contested by a number of other economists. Says 
Raisi, “This is unacceptable as the country needs to grow and diversify its 
economic base for which infrastructure development is important.” Thus the 
government is unlikely to slow down the pace of economic growth. According to 
the CBO paper – “An expansionary fiscal policy is essential for faster growth 
and economic diversification. Given the growth inflation trade off, the current 
policy emphasis is not to sacrifice growth, but to compensate the public for 
inflation induced loss in purchasing power.”<br>
<br>
<b>Looking ahead</b><br>
<img border="0" src="coverstory_suhail.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="93" height="121">External factors are unlikely to turn favourable soon as, on the demand side, 
rising per-capita income in emerging market economies, bio fuel demand and 
speculative demand for commodities as an alternative to bonds and stocks (in the 
face of falling interest rates and lacklustre stock markets) could continue for 
sometime. On the supply side, global warming and adverse weather conditions 
could affect crop production, artificial price controls used by some countries 
to curb current inflation could also weaken an appropriate supply response.<br>
<br>
<br>
Inflationary expectations feed inflation. This is especially true for pricing 
commodities and services as any adverse inflation expectation could lead to a 
further escalation of prices. This self-perpetuating nature of the problem can 
be a real source of worry for policy makers and companies alike.<br>
<br>
As the US economy slows down corporates are hopeful of inflation getting checked 
in the medium to long term. Says Bose, “There will be a worldwide slowdown in 
demand as industry cannot take any extra cost beyond a point, so while inflation 
will continue it will come down from double digits to single digit.” With the 
initiatives being taken by the government and the growing international efforts 
in this direction corporates are looking forward to such measures bringing some 
respite soon. Till then companies will have make to do with value engineering 
and cost cutting exercises. <br>

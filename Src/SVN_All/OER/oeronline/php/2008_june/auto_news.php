		The Spark offers strong protection in the event of an accident, all due 
		to the stable passenger cell, which is made predominantly of 
		high-strength steel. This not only ensures greater rigidity and 
		stability but also lowers the weight of the body shell. Other safety 
		features in the new Spark include driver, passenger and side air bags,

		completely functional even at zero tyre pressure, irrespective of the 
		speed the car moves at. Runflat is a self-supporting tyre with 
		reinforced inner walls made from heat resistant rubber that will 
		maintain shape and stability in the event of a puncture. It applies even 
		when the vehicle is fully loaded. <br>
		<br>
		The technology also incorporates a Tyre Pressure Indicator (TPI) to warn 
		the driver about loss of tyre pressure. Other benefits include 
		elimination of the spare tyre, allowing more boot space as well as 
		reduced vehicle weight, resulting in enhanced vehicle performance. All 
		BMW Runflat tyres are identified on both sidewalls with the RSC mark, 
		enabling customers to easily find the right BMW safety tyre for their

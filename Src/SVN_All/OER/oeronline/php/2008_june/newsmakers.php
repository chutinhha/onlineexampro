<b>Two women from the Sultanate have made it to the recently published list of 
the fifty most powerful Arab women by Forbes Arabia. OER meets these women who 
have been winning laurels for the country</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="Newsmaker.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="151" height="214" hspace="5">When a correspondent from Forbes Arabia got in touch with Manal Abdwani in early 
2008 with the request to fill a questionnaire for the listing, she took the 
exercise quite casually. “I did not think I stood a chance of making it to the 
list,” she says candidly. She was pleasantly surprised to be ranked as the 20th 
most powerful Arab woman. Forbes ranks Arab women based on their contribution to 
the companies they are associated with. Manal being the chairman of Oman Flour 
Mills and Mazoon Distribution Company was judged on the performance of these two 
companies. The article singles out Oman Flour Mill’s ability to maintain prices 
in the face of rising inflation as a major achievement. “We have to control the 
price of our products to minimise the impact on customers without infringing on 
the commercial spirit of the company,” says Manal. <br>
<br>
Mazoon Distribution Company is one of the companies that have come out of the 
unbundling of the electricity sector and it distributes power to close 200,000 
users in South Batinah and the Sharkiah region. Manal is working on a number of 
initiatives to improve efficiencies at the distribution company. Talking about 
the ranking she says, “I am happy to accept this recognition as it reflects the 
growing role and prominence of women in the Sultanate. There has been a focused 
drive on encouraging women to take on important responsibilities both in the 
public and private sector. Women have risen because of their merit and not 
because of any positive discrimination.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="Newsmaker1.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="151" height="235" hspace="5">Lujaina Darwish is no stranger to the Forbes list. Having been ranked No. 13 in 
2005 and No. 42 in 2004 she makes it to the Forbes list for the third time this 
year at No. 21. Says Lujaina, “I am proud to represent Oman on the list; this 
honour mirrors the role that women play in their respective countries.” <br>
Though the list is dominated by professionals from Saudi Arabia and the UAE due 
to the larger turnover of their companies, women from the Sultanate have 
consistently been making it to the list every year. “I see a big difference in 
the quality of women joining the workforce as they are better educated and more 
confident,” says Lujaina.<br>
<br>
Talking of women in important positions, there are broadly two types of 
developments taking place in the Sultanate, one is the ascendancy of women from 
business families. There are a number of examples of women taking over prominent 
roles in their businesses and bringing about seminal changes in the way things 
are done. The second are professionals in the government and private sectors who 
are making a mark. Lujaina represents the former as she has been setting new 
benchmarks in the industry since she joined her family business in 1994. “In my 
role as the head of the human resources, Omanisation and legal department I have 
tried out a strategic and coherent approach to the management of our 
organisation’s most valued asset – our employees who individually and 
collectively contribute to the objectives of the business,” she says. A 
multifaceted women, Lujaina was a member of the Majlis A’Shura, the consultative 
council of Oman from 2001-2007 (October).<br>

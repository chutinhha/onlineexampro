		values has helped Renaissance Services to build a business that promises 
		sustainable long term shareholder returns, writes Mayank Singh<br>

          <img border="0" src="ore_top20_62.jpg" width="250" height="189" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"><font face="Verdana" size="1">While 
		attending a course at Harvard Business School in 2005, I was seated next 
		to a Scottish gentleman during lunch. He was on the same course and 
		happened to be the Chairman of a company that owned a shipping fleet,” 
		reminisces Samir Fancy, Chairman Renaissance Services. The Scottish 
		gentleman was none other than Colin Rutherford, Chairman of BUE Marine 
		Holdings and the luncheon meeting presented the opportunity that Fancy 
		and his team were on the look out for. Renaissance had built up 
		substantial cash reserves and was keen to establish an asset base with 
		an oil and gas focus. Fancy casually outlined Renaissance’s plans and 
		promised to get back soon with something more concrete. After careful 
		consideration the senior mangement team realised that a deal with Bue 
		Marine was the one which fitted their plans perfectly leading to Bue 
		Marine’s acquisition. Thus Fancy and his team were quick to convert a 
		small opening into a momentous business deal. The success of Reniassance 
		Services is writ with numerous such examples of foresight and 
		perseverance against the most daunting odds.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Lets 
		take a look at some headline numbers – The year 2007 proved to be the 
		sixth successive year when the group has gone on to record its highest 
		revenue and net profit of RO199.2mn and RO17.3mn respectively. These 
		results show an annual compounded growth of 44.2 per cent in revenue and 
		33.8 per cent in operating profits over the last five-year period.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
          <img border="0" src="ore_top20_58.jpg" width="200" height="222" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		company won nine contracts valued at over US$767mn in 2007. These have 
		an individual valuation of over US$15mn and were disclosed by the 
		company in its public statements. The aggregate value of all contracts 
		won, including smaller contracts, contract renewals and contracts bound 
		by confidentiality clauses exceeded US$1bn.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		courage of convictions is another factor that has propelled Renaissance 
		to greater heights. The company has never shied away from taking up 
		challenges such as venturing into the Caspian Sea or venturing into Iraq 
		in the most daunting circumstances. An ability to take on these 
		challenges has helped it draw up an impressive list of achievements. 
		Renaissance has a fleet that is counted amongst the top 10 in the world. 
		Its offshore support vessel fleet holds market leadership in the Caspian 
		with approximately 70 per cent of the Azerbaijan market and 44 per cent 
		of the Kazakhstan market. The contract services business leads its home 
		market of Oman with 45 per cent market share (up from 35 per cent in 
		2006) and has established an 11 per cent share in its new international 
		markets.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>
		Consistent growth</b><br>
		Says Thomas, “Our erstwhile businesses have been highly cash-generative 
		and the Contract Services Group (CSG), in particular, has grown into a 
		substantial sized enterprise. We have used the cash generated by our 
		traditional services businesses to invest in the growth of the 
		asset-intensive Marine and Engineering Group (MEG). This has given us an 
		optimum balance between pure services and asset-based businesses.” The 
		approach has enabled it to spread geographically with an optimum balance 
		between high-risk higher-reward and low-risk lower-reward markets. It 
		has also helped Renaissance to intensify its primary focus on the oil 
		and gas sector. This strategy has been a cardinal factor behind the 
		regular, consistent and substantial growth seen over the past six years.</font><img border="0" src="ore_top20_59.jpg" width="200" height="233" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">A 
		break up of the Renaissance’s various business units gives one a better&nbsp; 
		understanding of the way the business is structured. The company is 
		broadly structured into three business groups. The Marine and 
		Engineering Group (MEG) owns and operates an offshore support vessel 
		fleet, currently comprising 76 vessels. It has engineering businesses 
		engaged in oil and gas fabrication, maintenance and afloat ship repair. 
		Though this business group operates primarily in the Gulf and the 
		Caspian it carries out contract assignments all over the world. The MEG 
		group accounts for over 62 per cent of Renaissance business.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		Contract Services Group (CSG) provides turnkey contract services such as 
		catering and facilities management, including building owning and 
		operating substantial permanent accommodation and life support 
		facilities in remote oilfields. CSG accounts for close to 27 per cent of 
		Renaissance business and has operations primarily in Oman, Iraq, Norway 
		and, most recently, Angola.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		technology, media and training businesses account for the remaining 11 
		per cent of the business.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>
		Future investments </b><br>
		A firm believer in reinvesting its profits into the business the company 
		has dovetailed an ambitious RO195.5mn (US$508mn) investment programme 
		for 2007-09. In 2007 Renaissance invested more than RO44.6mn (US$116mn) 
		towards this programme.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
          <img border="0" src="ore_top20_60.jpg" width="300" height="120" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		investment strategy focuses on three core initiatives – increasing the 
		size and reducing the age profile of the offshore support vessel fleet; 
		developing additional capacity and capability in the oil and gas 
		fabrication and ship repair businesses and expanding the capacity and 
		geographical spread of the company’s permanent accommodation for 
		contractors (PAC) facilities in remote oilfields. “This investment plan 
		strengthens the company’s businesses by significantly increasing the 
		volume of permanent sustainable business. The investment in assets has 
		also strengthened our balance sheet, which in turn drives the 
		scalability of our business,” says Fancy.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">A 
		major part of its investments are being used to acquire new vessels for 
		the offshore support fleet. The company is looking at increasing the 
		size of its fleet to around 100 vessels in the near term. All of 
		Renaissance vessels operate in growth markets that account for more than 
		50 per cent of the world’s hydrocarbon reserves, and most of the vessels 
		are on long-term contract assignments with some of the major global oil 
		and gas producers.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		company refutes any concerns about its debt equity ratio as being 
		baseless. Says Thomas, “Our current gearing is less than one. Based on 
		our current cash flows and the strength of the balance sheet, 
		Renaissance can fulfill its entire declared investment programme from a 
		mix of internal surpluses and borrowings and still remain within all 
		existing covenants with the company’s bankers and remain within the 
		debt-equity norm for the industries in which we serve.”</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
		Core competence approach </font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Going 
		against the grain of the prevailing business wisdom in the Middle East 
		of being in a variety of businesses, Renaissance’s objective is to 
		concentrate on its oil and gas related businesses and divest its other 
		companies. In pursuance of this objective the company has started 
		divesting its technology, media and training businesses. In April 2008, 
		it announced the acceptance of an offer from Oman based Services and 
		Trade/Sobha Group to acquire its technology business comprising of IMTAC 
		and its subsidiaries for approximately US$41mn (RO17.96mn). The sale is 
		expected to give the group a capital gain of RO6mn. This was preceded by 
		acceptance of an offer from a group of Omani led strategic investors to 
		sell its 100 per cent stake in UMS, the company’s media business for 
		RO3mn. The transaction is expected to realise a net gain of RO1.5 
		million.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
		Having finalised the details of the divestment of its technology 
		business, the company is sorting out the modalities of its final 
		transition. The divestment of its media arm has been delayed due to a 
		few regulatory issues and the company is working on it. Renaissance has 
		now turned its attention to divesting its training business.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		diversification process, though, has not been carried out with mercenary 
		intent. The management has set out some clear rules such as considering 
		only investors or industry players who offered positive outcomes for its 
		people and customers. Says Fancy, “We had others companies offering a 
		higher valuation for our business technology companies, but price was 
		never our prime motivator. We went ahead with Services and Trade/ Sobha 
		because of the synergies that the latter brought to the table.”</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">“The 
		decision to divest our Technology, Media and Training businesses is such 
		a wrench at the emotional level. These are great, high-performance, 
		high-potential businesses operated by first-class people. But, at the 
		practical level, we believe they will prosper further in their own more 
		specialist-focused environments, while we have turned our primary focus 
		to oil and gas,” says Thomas.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">On 
		the other hand, Renaissance sees tremendous potential in the oil and gas 
		space. As demand and supply ratios narrow more investment is expected to 
		go into new technology and pioneering methods of hydrocarbon recovery, 
		energy conservation and alternative energy sources. These trends bode 
		well for the long term sustainability of the energy sector.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		core competence approach is something that the company has been moving 
		towards for close to a decade. When Renaissance was listed in 1996 it 
		was structured as a holding company of diverse businesses and 
		investments and the subsequent change of its name to Renaissance 
		Holdings reflected that proposition. In mid-1998, the company started a 
		process of divesting its miscellaneous investments over a period of time 
		and started to focus on the company’s four core operating businesses. 
		This led to the company re-christening itself back to Renaissance 
		Services. Over the last decade the company’s most successful businesses 
		were built around its oil and gas clients, and its values and modus 
		operandi got more and more aligned with the high quality and safety 
		standards of that industry. As a logical extension Renaissance’s organic 
		and inorganic growth took place around these core competencies. The 
		company’s business units are focused on products and markets, whereas 
		its core competencies are focused on customer benefits. Renaissance’s 
		evolution has shown that the future is not simply an extrapolation of 
		its past. The company has logically re-invented itself around growing 
		competencies, consistent values and fantastic opportunities.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
		Conceptually too, there is great merit in a focused approach. As markets 
		go global there is a greater need for specialisation. The winners of 
		tomorrow are sure to be those companies that lead their industry in 
		targeting their markets carefully and producing the best value for money 
		in those target markets.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">“In 
		today’s global market, the winners are those who stay ahead of the 
		change curve, constantly redefining their industries, creating new 
		markets, blazing new trails, reinventing the competitive rules, 
		challenging the status quo. It is far easier to do that on a focused 
		platform of core competence and core values. C.K. Prahalad said, that 
		like a space rocket on the way to the moon, a company has to be willing 
		to jettison the parts of its past which no longer contain fuel for the 
		journey and which are becoming, in effect, excess baggage,” says Thomas.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
		The road ahead<br>
		</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">On the flip side, Renaissance, 
		like any other business, operates in a challenging environment and is 
		conscious about mitigating some of these factors. The company reckons 
		that it has minimised its risks by investing in assets and winning 
		long-term contracts that ensure continued and sustainable economic 
		growth. Renaissance holds 10-30 year contracts with blue chip clients in 
		the oil and gas sector. Secondly, it is focussed on a strong and growing 
		oil and gas sector and has established good market leadership positions 
		in the markets in which it serves.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		company’s competitive position is further strengthened by its diversity 
		and geographical spread. The oil and gas fabrication business, based in 
		Abu Dhabi, is the dominant local and regional player in the sector with 
		a focus on offshore construction. The ship afloat repair business is the 
		clear leader in the region and has strengthened its international reach 
		with bases in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman and multiple sites in UAE. In 
		individual markets, no single customer or supplier represents more than 
		10 per cent of each individual company’s revenue within Renaissance with 
		three major exceptions – for the contract services, Petroleum 
		Development Oman (PDO) and its contractors represent 20 per cent of 
		business in Oman, for the offshore support vessel fleet business BP 
		represents 90 per cent of revenue in Azerbaijan and Agip KCO represents 
		46 per cent of business in Kazakhstan – though this reflects BP’s 
		current status as the single dominant oil and gas producer in the 
		Caspian markets.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		company is aware of the primary challenges, obstacles and risks that may 
		impact its growth programmes like a potential exposure to exchange rate 
		issues, in particular the potential de-linking of various GCC currencies 
		from the US dollar; availability and cost of financing in the post-subprime 
		period; rising inflation in several key markets; availability of 
		resources in the oil and gas sector – people, materials and 
		infrastructure; availability of shipyard capacity and demand and 
		potential over-supply of vessels in the marine industry; and any 
		negative volatility in the oil and gas sector, including volatility of 
		oil prices.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
		company has hedged some portion of its US Dollar denominated 
		transactions to mitigate the possible exposure from any changes in 
		currency policy in the GCC. “So far, while there has been some post-subprime 
		upward pressure on financing costs we have found our presence in the oil 
		and gas sector and the nature of many of our assets being linked to 
		long-term safe contracts, mean that our business remains an attractive 
		proposition for financiers,” says Thomas. Rising inflation in the region 
		is also a matter of concern and the company is keeping a close watch on 
		rising costs especially while bidding for new contracts. The fact that 
		the company has had an excellent track record on people retention is a 
		key factor in addressing a shortage of resources in the booming oil and 
		gas industry. “We handle shortages in materials, infrastructure and 
		shipyard capacity by maintaining a high level of industry expertise in 
		our management team, focused on sourcing optimum economic and technical 
		solutions to meet our growth needs,” says Thomas.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
		Renaissance as a company has grown over the last decade through a 
		process of logical and decisive evolutions. The company is today a true 
		blue Omani multinational with offices in 18 countries and operations in 
		more than 39 countries. Its success is a case study for others to 
		emulate and learn from. Having laid out a solid foundation the company 
		is now poised to catapult its growth dramatically in the next few years.

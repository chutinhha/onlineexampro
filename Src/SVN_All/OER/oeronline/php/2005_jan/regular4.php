            <img border="0" src="im28.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="3" width="100" height="111">Incorporating 
            the fabulous Apple Click Wheel that was first introduced on iPod 
            mini, Offering up to 12 hours of battery life, Weighing in at just 
            5.3 ounces, And getting slightly thinner with each new generation, 
            iPod continues to define the perfect digital music player for Mac 
            and Windows.<br>
            A musical dream come true, the fourth-generation iPod offers huge 
            capacity, letting you easily slip up to 5,000 songs into your 
            pocket. And enjoy it wherever you go – in the car, on the treadmill, 
            in the office, or around the house. <br>
            In fact, the new fourth-generation iPod includes features that make 
            it even easier to access—and have fun with—your music. Take, for 
            example, the Apple Click Wheel. With the Click Wheel, you can select 
            playlists, scroll through a long list of albums or artists and 
            choose just the song you want to hear without ever lifting your 
            thumb from the wheel. Feel like mixing things up? Now you can choose 
            “Shuffle Songs” right from the main iPod menu. We think you’ll also 
            enjoy iPod’s long battery life – up to 12 hours. And with the 25 
            minutes of skip protection iPod provides, you can jump for joy and 
            the music will keep playing.<br>

            for the older gamer. The Playstation 2 has a lot of potential. There 
            are a couple of things missing however. The biggest is solid 
            Internet connectivity that the majority of users can use with ease 
            including both modem and Ethernet. Second is higher resolution 
            display outputs including VGA and 480p progressive component. Games 
            are what defines a system and while the initial releases for the PS2 
            were not very strong, some true classics will be released before any 
            of the competition can get in the way.<br>

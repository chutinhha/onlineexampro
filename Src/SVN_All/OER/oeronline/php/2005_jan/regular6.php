            OER about your career path...</b><br>
            Originally I’m from Iraq. I graduated with B.Sc. Physics, something 
            that has never been related to my business! I left in 1989 and began 
            my career in the UK in the automotive sector. Going a little bit 
            back, I have always been keen on cars as they have been a part of 
            our family business. I was involved, of course at a junior level, in 
            the selling and buying of cars since the age of 14. Once in UK, I 
            started from the bottom of the ladder – from sales, and have come up 
            the hard way. Simultaneously, I attended numerous training and 
            management courses. Moreover, I am also a Member of the Institute of 
            Motor Industry in the United Kingdom. Within three years, I was at 
            the management level. It was then that I moved on to the Whitehouse 
            Group, where I worked well over eight years.<br>
            <br>
            I started off as sales manager there, looking after the Nissan and 
            Seat operations. When I left, I was the director of operations. It 
            was a very challenging and active job, which involved all aspects of 
            the business. My role was to develop leadership and increase 
            profitability in all aspects of the business – sales, parts, 
            service, and body shop. I was reporting to the board of directors, 
            which I had a very healthy relationship with. In my eight years 
            there, we achieved the highest levels of profits from the 
            dealerships. It was hard, but very enjoyable as it involved taking a 
            lot of quick decisions to keep abreast of the market. We had a lot 
            of competition, people’s expectations were high – so, we had to be 
            on our toes and involved with all the aspects of the business. <br>
            <br>
            I have been with MHD for just over 19 months now, developing the 
            automotive business of the group in Oman. I am responsible for four 
            brands – Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo and Rover cars. We also have a 
            commercial vehicles side, which entails Ashok Leyland trucks from 
            India and CMC trucks and mini-buses from Taiwan. We are always 
            looking for new opportunities, and adding more agencies to our 
            business. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tell us about the management structure of MHD…</b><br>
            The managing director and the owner himself—Mr Mohsin Haider Darwish—heads 
            our company. He is a very honourable and experienced man, and it is 
            a joy to be working for him. I think he has had a big impact on the 
            Omani business scenario – not only in automotive, but elsewhere too. 
            His two daughters—HE Lujaina Darwish and Areej Darwish—are very 
            actively involved in the business, and work very closely in running 
            the daily operations of the business. They are both joint deputy MDs 
            of the company, supported by Arun Mehra, director-finance, all four 
            of who constitute the Corporate Committee.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What does your role in the company entail?</b><br>
            I am the Director for the Automotive Products of the company, and am 
            involved in developing the automotive products all around Oman 
            including the branches in Muscat (Azaiba), Sur, Sohar and Salalah. I 
            also look after all the after-sales operations, including parts, 
            service and body shop. My role obviously is to develop this business 
            to its maximum potential, bring in new ideas, new marketing 
            techniques and also developing staff, recruiting professionals to 
            ensure success. <br>
            <br>
            <b>How is the Omani market different from the UK?</b><br>
            It is a bit different and it would be unfair to compare it to the UK 
            market. United Kingdom has a highly developed automotive market, and 
            there cannot be a comparison of the volumes or any other aspect of 
            the business. I have been in Oman for about 18-20 months now, and I 
            can say that the Omani market is a developing market – it has a huge 
            potential. The year 2004 has been a great success for us. In 
            Automotive business, we have had a volume increase in both sales &amp; 
            after-sales, and our customer satisfaction measure is getting 
            increasingly better. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Briefly describe your management beliefs…</b><br>
            I am a very earnest and straightforward person, and I have always 
            been honest in my dealings – whether in the UK or here in Oman. I 
            think part of the reason for success in any business is to be honest 
            and to promise only what you can achieve, and then deliver what you 
            promised. <br>
            <br>
            My management style is an interactive one. My first task when I join 
            a company afresh is to meet everybody – right from the cleaners up 
            to the highest management level in my division. I think an 
            organisation is like a pyramid – when you are at the top of the 
            pyramid or just about at the top, you must realise that you need a 
            strong base to hold the structure, and you need to understand how 
            this base is operating, and then you can understand the weaknesses 
            and strengths of the organisation. <br>
            <br>
            So, I am hands-on. However, I do like to delegate certain jobs to 
            the professionals. It has to be a combination of both approaches. In 
            such a large organisation, doing everything yourself is impossible – 
            however, you need to know what’s going on by taking regular updates 
            from the team and feedback from customers. I also follow an 
            open-doors policy, and any employee of the organisation can walk in 
            at any time and talk freely about any ideas that he or she might 
            have or even any issues that they would like to escalate. <br>
            <br>
            I am also a big believer in the power of training. The brand will 
            definitely have its impact, but I think the people who represent 
            that brand are equally important, and they should be aware and 
            capable of handling any kind of situation. Also, a manufacturer’s 
            brand is important, but it must be allied to a strong local dealer’s 
            brand. While the former guarantees product quality, the latter 
            offers the security of the buying experience.<br>
            <br>
            In a nutshell, my ethos is:<br>
            a. Improve basic efficiency all the time.<br>
            b. Benchmark your current performance against your past and 
            competition’s. <br>
            c. Serve your customers well or someone else will.<br>
            d. Make money. If you don’t, you can’t do anything else. <br>
            e. Provide the backbone – staff development. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What drives MHD?</b><br>
            An undivided focus on customer service and satisfaction, and a 
            strong thrust to employee motivation and development. The success of 
            MHD LLC is down to a mixture of staff training and care—what we call 
            the MHD way—which translates into excellent customer satisfaction 
            and a regional growth strategy that enables MHD management to take a 
            hands-on approach. MHD is proof that focusing on customer service 
            pays off – but you have to maintain a tight rein over each outlet to 
            ensure that all staff is motivated to operate at the highest levels 
            of efficiency. MHD also has a strong sense of community spirit, 
            recognising that this helps to establish a good reputation in the 
            local area.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Which car do you drive and why?</b><br>
            I drive a Range Rover. I have driven a lot of cars in my life, from 
            sports cars to small cars to luxury car –it has been a part of my 
            job. But I have to say that Range Rover is different from any of 
            this. Every time you drive it, it’s like the first time. It has the 
            best cabin I have ever seen in my life. It has never let me down 
            performance-wise. Its off-road capabilities are second to none – I 
            have tested it in sands in Oman as well as in heavy terrains in the 
            United Kingdom. Even the quality of finish—from leather to wood—is 
            impeccable. Andthen there’s the whole history behind the brand.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Who would you credit your success to?</b><br>
            That’ll have to be my wife, who has always been very supportive and 
            understanding all through my career. The business that I am in is 
            very tough, and I have to often put in long hours. There are a lot 
            of sacrifices that one has to make, but she has been very 
            supportive, and has definitely been a part of my success. Sometimes, 
            things do not go as planned in business, but she has been very wise 
            and encouraging, and I have to give her credit for my success.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tell us something about the rest of your family…</b><br>
            I have three daughters – Tara, who is nine years old; Tia, who is 
            going to be four soon; and Tamara who’s just a year-and-a-half. 
            Unfortunately, I don’t have a lot of time for them. However, 
            whenever I do get some time, especially on the weekends, I do try 
            and spend quality time with my family.</font></p>

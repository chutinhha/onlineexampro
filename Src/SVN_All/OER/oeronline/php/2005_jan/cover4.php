            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The domestic 
            macroeconomic environment of Oman improved considerably in 2004 as 
            reflected in higher estimated growth in non-oil GDP, stable prices, 
            easy liquidity conditions, surpluses in the fiscal and current 
            account positions, higher foreign exchange reserves and notable 
            increases in employment opportunities. Given the predominant role 
            played by the oil sector in shaping the course of the economy, 
            despite the decline witnessed in oil production in the recent 
            period, the economy remained vibrant due to increase in oil prices.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The oil factor</b><br>
            With high oil prices, both balance of payments and fiscal positions 
            will remain comfortable and the higher growth in investment 
            expenditure in the budget bodes well for growth. The government’s 
            long-term priority is to diversify away from the economy’s reliance 
            on relatively limited oil resources. Towards this end, the objective 
            remains to reduce the fiscal dependence on hydrocarbon revenues, 
            undertake structural reforms to sustain the growth momentum of the 
            non-oil sector and ensure monetary and financial stability in the 
            economy.<br>
            <br>
            Oman’s banking and financial sector has evolved over time acquiring 
            a prominent role in promoting the development and growth process of 
            the economy. In a bank-dominated financial system, effective 
            intermediation has enabled the mobilisation of savings and their use 
            for investment purpose. In view of the oil dependent nature of the 
            economy and the important role of public expenditure in sustaining 
            the overall growth process and the increase of private investment, 
            effective intermediation of funds through a stable banking system 
            holds the key to ensure efficient interplay of aggregate demand and 
            supply in the system.<br>
            <br>
            Banks have a critical role to play in furthering the process of 
            privatisation and diversification, since all private initiatives to 
            attain this objective need to be complemented by adequate financing. 
            Given the well-established relationship between finance and growth, 
            and in view of the dominance of banks in the financial system of 
            Oman, banks play a notable role in driving the Omani economy.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Consolidation time</b><br>
            The banking sector in Oman continues to witness restructuring and 
            consolidation mainly through mergers, acquisitions and other 
            arrangements which is the outcome of a natural response to the 
            forces of change and technological advancements. Adequate capital is 
            one of the important indicators of the financial strength of banks. 
            Mirroring improvements in the health of the financial system, the 
            overall capital adequacy ratio of the commercial banks in Oman stand 
            close to 18 per cent, significantly higher than the minimum required 
            level of 12 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            As part of heightened supervisory oversight of the risk management 
            systems in banks, the on-site examinations of the Central Bank of 
            Oman have been made risk-focused and banks have been reporting their 
            risk profiles at monthly intervals. This approach helps in detecting 
            simmering symptoms of instability, both at the institutional and 
            systemic levels. Other initiatives that have been undertaken to 
            foster financial stability include the introduction of a Prompt 
            Corrective Action framework, a policy on securitisation of assets 
            and an upgraded Bank Credit and Statistical Bureau system. <br>
            <br>
            The CBO has taken the lead along with other financial institutions 
            in Oman to pursue policies that encourage Internet banking, 
            electronic fund transfers, and is in the final stages of introducing 
            Real Time Gross Settlement Systems (RTGS). Electronic means of 
            delivering services by banks will continue to develop at a rapid 
            pace and the CBO would encourage banks to deploy the latest 
            technology for customer satisfaction.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Future challenges</b><br>
            The challenges for the banks in Oman in 2005 and beyond will be to 
            strengthen and innovate and enhance efficiency both product wise as 
            well as technology wise. Banks must be prepared to face greater 
            competition and remain vigilant to the developments and changes that 
            take place in the financial and banking arena globally, due to 
            increased exposure to risks and contagion. <br>
            <br>
            The need to be forward looking will become all the more imperative 
            with the harmonisation of broad policies across GCC banking systems 
            emerging from the expected economic and monetary integration. The 
            banks also need to respond more to the developments in international 
            interest rates and accordingly impart greater flexibility to their 
            interest rate structures, both on the asset and liability sides. <br>
            <br>
            A narrowing of the wide interest range spreads presently seen among 
            banks in Oman may become necessary in order to remain competitive. 
            The financing of small- and medium-sized business enterprises would 
            also have to be actively pursued by banks as this would help in 
            generating employment opportunities in the private sector and aid 
            growth. <br>
            <br>
            Retail banking would continue to remain a core area, given the 
            demographic pattern of Oman which suggests growing demands in 
            consumption and investment. While banks will need to diversify into 
            different financial markets and products to be in business in this 
            era of globalisation, it adds on to the responsibilities of the 
            regulatory authorities for consolidated supervision to ensure that 
            the activities in one or more segments would not impair the 
            financials of banks and ultimately the depositor’s interest.</font></p>

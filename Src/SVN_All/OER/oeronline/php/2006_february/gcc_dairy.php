verdict is out. Bahrain remains the most economically free country in the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC). The country maintains a pro-business environment with 
an excellent banking and finance system, low regulation, and low barriers to 
foreign investment according to the 12th Index of Economic Freedom 2006 
published jointly by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal. <br>
<br>
However, despite its free economy, Bahrain receives over 80 per cent of its 
revenues from state-owned enterprises, mostly oil and gas. The report also 
considers Qatar as “mostly un-free” economy. However, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and 
the UAE are termed as “mostly free” economies by the report.<br>
<br>
In the overall ranking, Bahrain stands 25th, followed by Kuwait at 50th, Saudi 
Arabia at 62nd, UAE at 65th, Oman at 74th and Qatar at 78th rank. Countries 
receive a 1-5 rating, with one being the best, on 10 broad measures of economic 
freedom: trade policy, fiscal burden of government, government intervention in 
the economy, monetary policy, capital flows, and foreign investment, banking and 
finance, wages and prices, property rights, regulation and informal market 
activity. The scores are averaged to create an overall score.<br>
<br>
Thanks to its relatively cosmopolitan outlook, modern economy, favourable 
regulatory structure, and excellent communications and transportation 
infrastructure, Bahrain has become an ideal base for multinational firms looking 
to set up business ventures in Persian Gulf. However, for the second consecutive 
year, the country declined in economic freedom. In general, the entire Middle 
East has experienced a net decline in economic freedom registering worse scores.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gcc_dairy.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="350" height="199">Jasim Ali of University of Bahrain points out that Bahrain has lost five 
rankings in the 2006 Index of Economic Freedom. “The index rated Bahrain’s 
economy as mostly free, having achieved a score of 2.23 on the 5-point scale 
(the lower the better). “The country earned a grade of 2.15 in 2005. The 
downgrade reflected growing inflationary pressures,” says Ali. Another negative 
aspect, he points out, is Bahrain’s “worst result (4 out of 5) in the government 
intervention variable”. <br>
<br>
Overall, in all GCC countries, the economy has opened up to foreign investments 
with substantial barriers. If Kuwait restricts foreign investment in the 
upstream petroleum sector and does not allow foreigners to own real estate, the 
Bahraini government does not license companies wishing to compete with existing 
government-owned companies and established local enterprises.<br>
<br>
Qatar allows majority and full foreign ownership of businesses in agriculture, 
industry, health, education, tourism, and projects involved in the development 
of natural resources. Still, the law requires foreign businesses to employ a 
local agent. Foreign companies face a higher tax rate (up to 35 per cent) than 
do domestic companies (0 per cent). Foreign investment in the UAE is restricted, 
except for companies located in one of the free zones.<br>
<br>
Similarly, majority of GCC countries control prices and provide subsidies to a 
variety of items. In the same way, though these countries do not mandate minimum 
wages in the private sector, they do set wages in the public sector.<br>
<br>
As a general rule, government intervention is very high in GCC countries. 
Foreign investment limitations are moderate to high. The region has low fiscal 
burden and trade policy restrictions varied between moderate and high. Rest all 
categories experience only moderate government restrictions.- Sowmya Sri

                        The cancellation of the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF), 
                        following the death of Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashidh Al 
                        Maktoum, has left mixed impact on the hotel and tourism 
                        industry of the Emirate. Dubai, a haven of shopping and 
                        a global tourist destination, usually attracts around 3 
                        million people during this annual event. <br>
                        <br>
                        Since its inception in 1996, DSF has drawn people from 
                        across the globe. The world’s best brands are available 
                        here for best prices during the one-month event with the 
                        motto - 'One Family, One World, One Festival'. Though 
                        the event has been put off this year, retail sales are 
                        allowed. DSF logos and messages will be removed from the 
                        products. It is expected that retail spending could 
                        cross Dh7.67 billion, about 7 per cent of Dubai’s 
                        Dh110-billion GDP. DSF 2005 has recorded 3.3 million 
                        visitors who spent Dh6.67 billion during the 32-day long 
                        festivities that translates to Dh2,021.21 average 
                        spending per visitor.<br>
                        <br>
                        In 2004, the tourism industry recorded 37 per cent 
                        growth in revenue from 5.42 million hotel guests, 
                        reaching Dh6.2 billion last year. Nevertheless, with the 
                        cancellation of DSF, many hotels reported drop in 
                        occupancy levels. Even the Eid booking did not meet the 
                        expectations . At the same time, the hospitality 
                        industry in general feels that Dubai, with or without 
                        DSF, continues to be a hot destination. The city has 40 
                        malls apart from the traditional souqs to attract 
                        tourists. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Dubai Gold &amp; Jewellery Group -- an association of 
                        more than 700 gold and jewellery members in Dubai -- has 
                        resumed its promotions, the jewellery campaign and the 
                        gold coin campaign, in the greater interest of consumers 
                        after DSF permitted private sector to run retail 
                        campaigns. So DSF might be cancelled technically, the 
                        shopping event still continues without its international 
                        theatre and street performances, fashion shows, nightly 
                        fireworks and laser shows, film festivals, children's

                        Saudi Arabia’s equity market had an impressive year in 
                        2005 and is heading for a fruitful 2006. Saudi’s All 
                        Share Index closed at 16,712.64 points by the end of the 
                        2005 compared to 8206.23 for 2004, an increase of 103.66 
                        per cent. The establishment of Capital Market Authority 
                        (CMA) and the country joining the WTO has helped pep up 
                        the Saudi stock market. <br>
                        <br>
                        The total shares trade rose by 19.26 per cent, reaching 
                        12.28 billion, compared to 10.3 billion for 2004. A 
                        total of 46.61 million transactions were executed during 
                        2005 compared to 13.32 million for 2004, recording a 
                        huge rise of 250 per cent. CMA Governor Jemaz Al-Suhaimy 
                        told delegates at a recent stock market conference in 
                        Riyadh that the Saudi bourse is 16th among the world’s 
                        50 largest stock markets. “The market grew by an average 
                        of 38 per cent annually and 95 per cent this year,” he 
                        added.<br>
                        <br>
                        According to a report by National Commercial Bank of 
                        Saudi, since the end of 2000, investors in the Saudi 
                        equity market reaped a 495.8 per cent gain on the rise 
                        in share prices — and that is besides the dividend 
                        payments of around 2.5 per cent annually and around one 
                        per cent from the distribution of free bonus shares. <br>
                        <br>
                        It has been a good time for investors on the Saudi stock 
                        market. The overall wealth of the investments increased 
                        by well over 500 per cent during the last five-and-half

                        on high oil prices</b><br>
                        Backed by high oil prices and production levels, Kuwait 
                        has reportedly recorded an exuberant growth for the year 
                        2005. According to a report released by Global 
                        Investment House, it is believed that the robust 
                        economic conditions and increased private spending as 
                        well as a strong pick up in gross fixed capital 
                        formation driven by several capital projects could 
                        result in double digit growth in 2005. <br>
                        <br>
                        The report attributed the high growth rate of Kuwait 
                        mainly to the ascending price of crude oil, throughout 
                        2004 and in 2005, thanks to the continued strong demand 
                        emanating from emerging economies and the damages caused 
                        by the hurricanes in the US. The rising oil prices not 
                        only helped the economy but also fostered growth 
                        prospectus in markets.<br>

                        contrast to a disappointing first half of 2004, the 
                        positive macro economic conditions and superior 
                        performance of the Kuwaiti companies have led to an 
                        improved market sentiment, thereby helping regain the 
                        confidence of investors. In terms of year-to-date 
                        performance, all sectors were on positive territory in 
                        the first ten months of 2005, growing at double-digit 
                        rates with insurance sector experiencing the lowest 
                        growth rate of 16.87 per cent. <br>
                        <br>

                        appreciation for the whole year of 2004. The banking 
                        sector – the largest of all sectors – too finally caught 
                        the fancy of the investors after a period of 
                        under-valuation to record a gain of 49.9 per cent, the

                        Kuwait reached an all time high of KD3.855 billion in 
                        the first half of 2005. Based on this, trade balance is

                        implying 35.5per cent growth over 2004. This is the

                        remaining 55 per cent, or 4.13 billion, will be offered 
                        to the public. <br>
                        <br>
                        Of the promoters’ equity, 25 per cent will be retained 
                        by Qatari investors, whereas 20 per cent will be held by 
                        investors from other GCC states. As for the bank’s 
                        public equity, 80 per cent of it was earmarked for 
                        Qataris and the remaining 20 per cent to other GCC 
                        nationals. <br>
                        <br>
                        One of the two mega banks to be floated in Qatar, Al 
                        Rayyan Bank, launched an initial public offering (IPO) 
                        on January 15, 2006, and received overwhelming response 
                        from both Qatari and GCC citizens. Minimum subscription 
                        will be for 500 shares while maximum allotment will be 
                        50,000 shares.Though the IPO is open till January 29, 
                        sources say that it has been subscribed many times over.<br>
                        <br>
                        To say the response from GCC nationals was overwhelming, 
                        would be an understatement -- on one particular day 
                        there was even a mini-stampede and unruly scenes were 
                        reported at the Qatar Sports Club, where QNB, the lead 
                        arranger, had set up facilities for GCC investors. <br>
                        <br>
                        In the melee, a glass panel of a door of the main hall 
                        at the sports club was damaged. When the crowds became 
                        unruly special public security forces were deployed and 
                        they soon controlled the situation. <br>
                        <br>
                        Main entrances to the club were closed a little before 
                        noon with many in the crowd screaming to throw it wide 
                        open since every one seemed to be in a hurry to complete 
                        subscription formalities and leave Doha for home. <br>
                        <br>
                        Although people from different GCC countries came for 
                        the IPO, Saudis outnumbered all others. <br>
                        <br>
                        The promoters of Al Rayyan Bank are Qatari Diar (the 
                        newly established and state-sponsored real estate giant) 
                        and the Qatar General Retirement and Pension Authority. 
                        Qatari IPOs have so far been offered to nationals only. 
                        Another recent Qatari launch that attracted huge GCC 
                        interest was the Lusail project. <br>
                        <br>
                        The $5 billion project is already in the market, and has 
                        attracted wide interest from the region, especially 
                        Kuwait.</font></td>

                        The year 2006 has brought double blow to the Gulf 
                        Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. First, it was the 
                        ruler of Dubai, Shaikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, 
                        who passed away on January 4, 2006 at the age of 62. 
                        Then, within 10 days, the “Father of Modern Kuwait”, 
                        Emir, Sheikh Jaber Al- Ahmed Al-Sabah passed away on 
                        January 15, 2006.<br>
                        <br>
                        Shaikh Maktoum was also the Vice President and Prime 
                        Minister of the UAE. He was a unique leader who enjoyed 
                        a close bond with people and shared their dreams. 
                        Citizen’s welfare always topped his priority list. With 
                        an eye on the less affluent citizens, Sheikh Maktoum 
                        spearheaded a programme to construct thousands of new 
                        homes in projects throughout Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al 
                        Qaiwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah, the other emirates 
                        of the UAE. In his 15 years of rule, Maktoum converted 
                        Dubai, the tiny Gulf emirate, into a world-renowned 
                        commerce and tourism hub of the Middle East. <br>
                        <br>
                        Sheikh Jaber is credited with transforming Kuwait from a 
                        small emirate into a modern nation-state. During the 
                        invasion of Kuwait in August of 1990, Sheikh Jaber stood 
                        like a pillar of strength and rebuilt the country. When 
                        he was the Minister of Finance and Economy, he 
                        established The Credit Bank, offering real estate, 
                        industrial and agricultural credit to citizens and 
                        businesses alike, issued a Kuwaiti currency (previously 
                        Kuwait used the Indian Rupee) and established a board to 
                        supervise the issuing of banknotes and coins. <br>
                        <br>
                        In 1961, with financial support from and under the 
                        direction of Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, Sheikh 
                        Jaber established the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic 
                        Development. The fund’s goal of fostering the economic 
                        and social development of fellow Arabs was an incredible 
                        achievement, particularly when you consider that Kuwait 
                        itself was still considered a developing nation at the 
                        time. Today, the fund has given grants to over 70 
                        countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Central Asia 
                        and Europe, as well as Arab nations around the world for 
                        whom the fund was originally meant.<br>
                        <br>
                        In 2005, the shadow of grief engrossed Saudi Arabia. On 
                        August 1, 2005, the Kingdom lost the Custodian of the 
                        Two Holy Mosques King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. As 
                        King, he supervised projects to facilitate Hajj for the 
                        millions of pilgrims from around the world each year. 
                        Under King Fahd’s rule, Mecca was expanded to 3.5 
                        million square feet to accommodate one million 
                        worshippers. Medina has grown to nearly 1.8 million 
                        square feet to accommodate 500,000 people, according to 
                        his official biography. <br>
                        <br>
                        For the UAE, the death of Shaikh Maktoum came almost a 
                        year after the passing away of the visionary leader, His 
                        Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of 
                        the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Ruler of the Emirate 
                        of Abu Dhabi, who died on November 2, 2004. Sheikh 
                        Zayed, who was instrumental in the formation of the UAE, 
                        brought a high standard of living that has spread 
                        throughout the seven emirates, from the ultra-modern 
                        cities to the remotest areas of desert and mountains.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The change has, moreover, occurred against a backdrop of 
                        enviable political and social stability, despite the 
                        insecurity and conflict that has dogged much of the rest 
                        of the Gulf region.<br>
                        <br>
                        The strength, vision and dedication of these leaders 
                        have transformed the Gulf into a major trade center in 
                        the international market.</font></td>

new perspective is virtually challenging the traditional command-and-control 
structures. This network trend is not limited to the business enterprise alone; 
non-profit and governmental organizations fall equally under its sway. The 
network enterprise does not follow the same rules as the classic corporate 
model. In order to adapt to this Next Reality, the leaders of an organization 
must dispense with six fallacies that once upon time made perfect sense.<br>
<br>
<b>Fallacy #1:</b> Management must focus on the internal operations of the enterprise
<br>
<b>Next Reality: </b>Every dimension of the network enterprise must be client-facing. 
Even senior executives can ill afford to manage the firm's resources apart from 
their impact on the end customer. Consider it managing from the outside in. If a 
process limits the organization's capacity to take advantage of new market 
opportunities or suppresses innovation, it must be changed. <br>
<br>
<b>Fallacy #2: </b>Geography defines the ecology of the enterprise <br>
<b>Next Reality:</b> Recently, I was in Europe advising a client, an enterprise in the 
financial services sector that operates independent business units in countries 
around the globe. Until recently, my client did not take advantage of its 
network opportunities. Each national business unit functioned as a silo, and as 
a result, each one carried out a needless replication of tasks. The global 
company also failed to pick up on successful experiments that were taking place 
in parallel universes, that is, initiated by sister business units. My client is 
now developing creative ways to take advantage of its network, leveraging 
resources and brand across business units. The company is now thinking 
horizontally instead of thinking vertically. <br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>
<img border="0" src="managment1.jpg" width="158" height="221" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2"></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Fallacy #3: </b>Technology drives business operations <br>
<b>Next Reality: </b>Technology does not drive organizational change; it is only a tool 
for change. I have witnessed far too many enterprises imploding once seduced by 
a new software system. It is much more critical for an enterprise to build 
around its relationship capital. People still matter most. Managers would be 
wise to map out the flow of knowledge and relationships that truly create value 
in their organizations, and then find the right technology to enhance that 
process. Knowledge management applied in a vacuum is a waste of resources. <br>
<br>
<b>Fallacy #4:</b> Hire for specialized knowledge <br>
<b>Next Reality: </b>Generalists are a dime a dozen. Narrow specialists, on the other 
hand, risk isolation and inaccessibility. Really valuable employees provide 
specialized knowledge that adds to the core competency of the enterprise. Strong 
managers aim to create a culture where unique knowledge will be produced and is 
made accessible to the network. It is easy to underestimate the importance of 
trust. Without trust, access remains stunted. <br>
<br>
<b>Fallacy #5: </b>Performance management is most effective when it rewards individual 
effort<br>
<b>Next Reality:</b> The individual was the primary productive unit of the classic 
corporate enterprise. In the network enterprise, the team moves to the fore. 
Employee evaluation and compensation therefore must incorporate team performance 
measures. Individual employees should expect to shift between organizational 
structures and adapt to new functions as needed. Job descriptions are at best 
provisional. <br>
<br>
<b>Fallacy #6: </b>Employees who demonstrate exceptional competency should be groomed 
as future leaders. <br>
<b>Next Reality: </b>The move from command-and-control structures to a network 
enterprise does not imply the decline of leadership. A new style of leadership 
emerges. As strange as it sounds, the manager ceases to be the expert. If you 
think about it, we should expect knowledge workers within their competency area 
to know more than their boss. The right metaphor for leadership is the conductor 
of an orchestra. <br>
<br>
Each individual musician knows her instrument better than the conductor, but it 
takes a special kind of talent to arrange and harmonize the full range of 
instruments. Here's another sure sign of a network leader: A willingness and 
capacity to be in constant learning mode. <br>
<br>
In summary, the network enterprise feeds off effective collaboration across 
fixed boundaries. A new generation of leaders will excel in taking advantage of 
the peculiarity of their organizations to energize and support valuable 
networks.<br>

<font face="Verdana" size="1">Capital Store LLC is following an aggressive business expansion strategy with 
focus on Oman. OER speaks to Haider Jawad Sultan, MD of Capital Store LLC, to 
take stock of the company<br>
<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Talking about overall market 
environment, Haider Jawad Sultan, Managing Director of Capital Store LLC, says, 
“the accelerated growth in the retail sector in all categories, including 
luxurious products and FMCG can be attributed to Oman’s robust economic growth.”<br>
<br>
What’s Capital Store’s retail model and business strategy in Oman? Sultan 
replies, “Our prime objective is customer satisfaction. We strive to offer top 
quality shopping experience to all our customers. This means offering them the 
latest products, a pleasant ambience and, last but not the least, we strive to 
gain their confidence. Our sales persons are trained to give our customers the 
right advice, without pressurising them. In the near future, we plan to expand 
our product range and profile, and plans in this regard will be announced 
shortly.”<br>
<br>
Capital Store doesn’t have presence outside Oman. Why? “Our strategy is to 
concentrate on Oman. We are not planning to expand our operations to other 
countries, but we have plans to expand our retail chains here – not only in 
Muscat, but in other cities as well. We have plans to open another outlet in 
Salalah by October and in Sohar by the end of next year,” says Sultan.<br>
<br>
On the business growth, he informs, “Capital Store has been enjoying double 
digit growth. This is in line with the thriving economy and constant addition of 
new products. Our flagship store is at Qurum. Unfortunately, it was affected by 
cyclone Gonu. We will reopen the store in the next few months and it will 
hopefully be the biggest and the most modern store in Oman, offering a unique 
shopping experience. In the interim, Capital Store has reopened at the former 
Baby shop in Qurum. The other stores are located at Sabco Center Mall, Bahja 
Mall, CCC, Salalah and we have a perfumery section at Centre Point, Al Khuwair 
as well.”<br>
<br>
On the Omanisation front, he says, “We have always welcomed the government’s 
strategy to depend as less as possible on foreign workforce. Capital Store Bahja 
is a role model of Omanisation. All the beauty consultants are Omanis. We are 
constantly on the look out for Omani staff and welcome them in our organisation. 
All Omanis are trained according to their job profile and are well looked 
after.”<br>
<br>
What are his future growths plans for Capital Store? He says, “We want to offer 
our customers the most modern and updated shopping experience. We plan to expand 
our distribution and product profile, with the aim that we will continue to 
remain the market leaders.” </font></p><div align="center">

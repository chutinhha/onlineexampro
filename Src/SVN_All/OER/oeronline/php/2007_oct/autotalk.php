<br>
<b>The Kia Opirus now hauls a larger, more powerful engine, and digs itself 
deeper to take on competition</b></font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

<font face="Verdana" size="1">When the flagship of Kia Motors arrived in Oman, people wondered why had Kia 
gone on to build a ‘large sized’ sedan. Not that they don’t have large cars – 
the Carens, Sorento and Carnival are big by all means – but Kia was better known 
for more affordable cars without any perceptible drop in QC. They gave 
competitors a run for their money, taken in their stride the design and ‘flavours’. 
Yet, public opinion changed quickly after they had just one look at the options 
that the Opirus provided. Simply put, it was ‘fully loaded’ and ‘lightly 
priced’.<br>
<br>
Here, practically all car-brands aren’t older than 30 or so years. But Kia’s 
American strategy (Opirus was designed with the US market in mind) provides an 
insight of what they were aiming for: Kia is only some 10 years old in the US, 
and they had decided to bring in their flagship to compete against the likes of 
the Avalons, Accords and even Lincolns, if you’ll allow in terms of space. This 
was 20 years after Toyota brought in its Crown (no pun intended) to the Land of 
Opportunity. Gutsy, we’d say.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Opirus did quite well around the world, with some people complaining 
about it being slow even with the earlier 3.5, V6. Then there were those who, as 
humans generally do, wanted more. Kia simply went ahead and gave it to them! At 
a price, you’d immediately counter – but we don’t think a RO500 increase is 
anything to even speak about.<br>
<br>
So, what’s the change? Well, for starters, the motor; now bumped up by 300ml, 
the V6 pumps almost 270hp (at a non-American 6000rpm) and 260 foot-pounds of 
torque. This is more than required to make this car scary-fast. Kia claims a 32 
per cent increase in horsepower over the outgoing 3.5-litre engine, but it also 
delivers a 9.4 per cent improvement in fuel economy in the city and 5.7 per cent 
on the highway. <br>
<br>
<b>More Comfort</b><br>
We have always been impressed with the Opirus’ equipment levels, ample space and 
even its build quality. The interiors benefit from a genuine aluminium trim, 
with the black upholstery, and wood grain with the grey, and a very tidy 
presentation all through. Ideas borrowed from luxury brands can be found here 
and there (the BMW-style map pocket in the doors; the Mercedes-style power seat 
adjusters). The cabin is notably spacious, with excellent legroom. The seats are 
supportive and comfortable, and the leather seems high quality and has a 
pleasant texture and feel. The ride is very good and the car is virtually silent 
at highway speeds. The trunk is cavernous.<br>
<br>
We tried our best to nit-pick classical trim issues, panel fits or even an odd 
misplaced switch. There wasn’t any. Then there is the list of gadgets from the 
Infinity sound system with 6-disc changer with steering controls, 
cruise-control, plenty of air-bags and even dual-exhausts. The ergonomics are 
near-perfect. However, the interior design has some way to go before anyone is 
actually impressed by the looks alone–they should start with the remote-buttons 
on the steering wheel. But overall the Opirus seems very well put together.<br>
<br>
It even has chassis and suspension improvements altering its handling to quite 
an extent. Driving over the recent temporary road surfaces brought about no 
discomfort inside the cabin. The consequence is that the car has excessive body 
roll around corners. Overall, the Opirus’ road manners are acceptable, but more 
sporty buyers would have preferred last year’s tighter suspension setup. When it 
comes to braking, well, it is actually a better performer than the Japanese or 
American competition. There is the Electronic Stability Programme. This explains 
the lower amount of dive and squat, while braking and accelerating, even as it 
retain the cushion feel.<br>
<br>
Although styling is a subjective quality, the dealers thankfully asked for the 
more elegant-looking grille than the cheese-grater style that was first intended 
– as with the US units. Incidentally, Kia recently announced they have hired 
former Audi/VW design chief, Peter Schreyer, to oversee the company’s domestic 
and international design functions. Expect this to further differentiate Kia 
from the competition (and from Hyundai) in the coming years.<br>
<br>
While Kia may not be a luxury brand, they have produced a comprehensively 
equipped, full-size vehicle that drives very well and has many luxury features. 
With its long warranty and solid build quality, the Opirus is definitely worth a 
look if you’re in the market for a large, comfortable, vehicle at this price 
point. </font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

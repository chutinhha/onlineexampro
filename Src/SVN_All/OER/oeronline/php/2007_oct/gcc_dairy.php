        <br>
        <b>Growing numbers of high net worth individuals, gradual economic reform 
        and the deepening of capital markets are encouraging many western 
        financial services firms to set up or expand asset management operations 
        in the Middle East, says the latest EIU report</b><br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">According to a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), 
        more than 80 per cent of respondents say that they expect to increase 
        their investments in the region over the next three years. A number of 
        factors, however, continue to deter potential investors, including 
        concerns about the regulatory environment, a lack of transparency and 
        political instability in the region.<br>
        <br>
        The survey forms the basis of Asset Management in the Middle East: The 
        prospects for global financial institutions, a newly released EIU report 
        sponsored by the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) Authority. The report 
        looks at the business environment for asset management in the Middle 
        East, examines the region’s developing investor culture and explores 
        some of the products and services that are likely to attract attention 
        as the sector develops.<br>
        <br>
        “There is a strong appetite among global financial institutions to 
        invest in the asset management sector in the Middle East,” says Rob 
        Mitchell, editor of the report.<br>
        <br>
        “High levels of wealth are fuelling strong demand for private banking 
        and wealth management services, while greater maturity among investors 
        and a more robust financial infrastructure are encouraging the 
        development of the retail investment sector. But despite these 
        opportunities, a number of problems persist that are deterring further 
        investment, including a lack of transparency, concerns about the 
        regulatory environment and difficulties recruiting skilled finance 
        professionals in the region,” he adds. <br>
        <br>
        The conclusions of the report are based on a survey of 180 senior 
        executives from financial services firms conducted by EIU and a series 
        of in-depth interviews with representatives from companies that are 
        already investing in the region.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Key findings</b><br>
        Private banking is seen as the strongest investment opportunity. 
        Financial institutions that offer private banking and wealth management 
        services see the Middle East as an increasingly important market, and 
        many are recruiting or relocating client relationship managers to serve 
        the region. The growing ranks of high net worth individuals, coupled 
        with developments in the capital markets in the region, are increasing 
        demand for more sophisticated products, including derivatives, hedge 
        funds and exchange traded funds. Other important investment 
        opportunities cited by respondents include private equity and retail 
        investment.<br>
        <br>
        Islamic finance is becoming an important component of the asset 
        management offering. Both survey respondents and interviewees are 
        confident that the growth of the Islamic finance sector will continue. 
        As of now, it has not been particularly strong in many areas of asset 
        and fund management, but this is likely to change. Almost 60 per cent of 
        respondents say that they expect a substantial increase in demand for 
        Islamic finance products over the next three years, and a growing 
        proportion of respondents say that they expect at least some of their 
        products to be Shariah-compliant.<br>
        <br>
        Strategic alliances are seen as the most favoured entry or expansion 
        strategy. Entry or expansion strategies into the Middle East depend on 
        individual market conditions and the regulatory environment of the 
        specific country but, in general, respondents favour strategic alliances 
        and joint ventures. With the provision of banking licences becoming more 
        commonplace, it is likely that more and more foreign banks will take the 
        branch licence or representative office approach.<br>
        <br>
        A number of issues continue to deter investment in the region. Despite 
        progress in areas such as the regulatory and business environment, 
        respondents point to a number of deterrents to further investment in the 
        region. Concerns about the geopolitical environment remain high on the 
        agenda for many in the sector, with 71 per cent citing this as 
        significant. A lack of transparency and poor standards of regulatory 
        regime are also raised as an issue, with 65 per cent citing these as 
        deterrents to investment.<br>

        growth in the Middle East and Africa region should continue, with mobile 
        device volumes expected to more than double from 2006 to 2010. “We 
        estimate that the Middle East and Africa region may have the highest 
        growth rate in industry device volumes over the next three to four 
        years,” Kallasvuo said during the official opening of Nokia’s new 
        regional office in Dubai.<br>
        <br>
        ”We have forecasted a global market of 4 billion subscriptions in 2010, 
        up from the current level of just over 3 billion. And we expect that 
        nearly a quarter of the increase in subscriptions will come from this 
        region,” he said. <br>
        <br>
        “We plan to strengthen our operations by reaching further into rural 
        communities to bring mobile communications to more people,” he added. 
        Nokia expects the region’s industry device volumes to more than double 
        by 2010 from the estimated over 100 million devices sold in 2006 <br>

        Kuwait, Barrak al-Sabeeh, said. The company’s operations in Kuwait, 
        Jordan, Bahrain and Sudan have immediately come under the new name, 
        while its operations in 14 African countries, Iraq and Lebanon will 
        change later. MTC in Saudi Arabia, slated to launch in early 2008, will 
        operate as Zain. The company has been awarded the third mobile licence 
        in Saudi Arabia. Sabeeh said that Zain headquarters would shortly be 
        based in Dubai or Bahrain or in the Dutch city of Amsterdam. He said the 
        company would continue to expand globally by chasing every investment 
        opportunity. Currently, Zain is bidding for licences in Qatar and

        DubaiSat-1 will also help manage natural disasters and promote research 
        and development, space science and other scientific disciplines. This 
        pioneering satellite project consists of three phases over a three-year 
        period. The first phase started in 2006 and saw the institution develop 
        the strategies, budget, administrative structure, and the necessary 
        staff. The second phase, covering this year, includes the design and 
        development of the prototypes for the equipment and tools of the

        executive flight services provider, has launched a cost-effective 
        Learjet service in a tactical move to broaden private charter appeal 
        within the region. Using its newly acquired, twin-engined Learjet 35s, 
        the Abu Dhabi-headquartered operator has lowered chartering rates for 
        the six-seater aircraft by around 20 per cent of prevailing market 
        rates. Royal Jet’s Learjet 35s can be chartered for US$2,850 an hour. 
        “This is a tactical move to demonstrate the affordability of private 
        charter when, for instance, point-to-point, day return private travel 
        from the UAE to Kuwait can be achieved for US$10,000 for six people,” 
        said Shane O’Hare, President and CEO, Royal Jet. “This aircraft is one 
        of the fastest in its class. It is a proven business tool in it that 
        enables time-pressed executives to undertake business meetings 
        throughout the region at their own schedules. It would, for instance, be 
        perfectly feasible to fly to meetings, say from Abu Dhabi to Manama, 
        Riyadh or Kuwait and returning back in a single day, something which 
        cannot be achieved with scheduled services,” explained O’Hare. “Clients

        marketing campaign led by the Economic Development Board. A new economic 
        vision for Bahrain will be launched within two months, EDB chief 
        executive Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa said. “We live in a highly 
        competitive world, which means we need to fight harder for visitors, 
        investment and business opportunities,” he said. “We must not lose sight 
        of what makes Bahrain authentic and unique. We must be clear about who 
        and what we are.” Shaikh Mohammed was speaking at the launch of the 
        Brand Positioning Strategy for the Kingdom of Bahrain. International 
        public relations agency Weber Shandwick has been appointed to promote 
        Bahrain’s brand image. “An international advertising agency will also be

        Saudi Arabia will suffer heavy economic losses by continuing to follow 
        the Thursday-Friday weekend routine, according to businessmen who have 
        renewed their call to change weekly holidays to Friday and Saturday. The 
        new call came after Kuwait, also a member of the Gulf Cooperation 
        Council (GCC), introduced the Friday-Saturday weekend despite objections 
        from certain sections. Among the six GCC countries, four – Bahrain, 
        Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates – have now switched over to 
        the new system with only Saudi Arabia and Oman following the traditional 
        Thursday-Friday weekend. Economists say that the continuation of 
        Thursday-Friday weekend will put Saudi Arabia a month behind other 
        countries, including some GCC states, in a year. “By sticking to the old 
        system Saudi Arabia will continue to suffer heavy economic losses and 
        will be isolated from the rest of the world,” one businessman said. 
        Adnan Al Naeem, secretary-general of the Eastern Province Chamber of

        aimed at global financial and business audiences. It was first aired on 
        September 9 through Al Jazeera International, CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg and

        Wall Street Journal, The Economist and The Banker, and Internet sites

        a traditionally dressed Qatari boy standing on the beach of West Bay, 
        with the expanding business district in the background, skimming stones 
        across the sea. It is accompanied by a sound track of a quickening 
        heartbeat which helps signify the vibrancy of the country and underlines 
        the theme of the commercial which is ‘At the heart of business’. Steve 
        Martin, Head of Corporate Communications and Marketing of the QFC 
        Authority, says: “Our first campaign told the audience that Qatar was 
        ‘ready for business’ but now we are emphasising that Qatar is doing 
        business. The commercial shows how the pace of the country has picked up 
        and is gaining considerable momentum. Together with its partners it is 
        creating the fastest growing economy in the world.” The commercial is 
        supported by two new press advertisements, one of which focuses on the

        prefer it. This is obviously a major project for Qatar and we are proud 
        to be able to say we will hold the first Grand Prix event under lights,” 
        Nasser bin Khalifa Al-Attiyah from the Qatar Motor and Motorcycle 
        Federation (QMMF) said. “Whilst this is great for the country’s image as 
        a whole, it also means our track can be used in the hot summer months 
        and we hope this opens up more opportunities for other motorsports 
        events in the future.” </font><br>

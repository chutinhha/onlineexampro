Major deals and high profile technology launches marked the GITEX Technology 
Week held in Dubai last month. OER reports </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="../2007_oct/special_report.jpg" width="350" height="213" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">With focus on business solutions, telecommunications and consumer electronics, 
the exhibitors at GITEX this year showcased a range of dazzling displays for the 
visitors. One of the largest and most significant announcements was SAP AG’s 
acquisition of the software license and maintenance business of SAP Arabia, its 
exclusive long-term partner in the region. International industry observers feel 
the deal will have significant implications for the business software market.<br>
<br>
Other major announcements included the unveiling of the master plan for 
SmartCity Malta, a new self-sustained industry township for knowledge-based 
companies to be developed by Dubai-based SmartCity in partnership with the 
Government of Malta, and the award of a multi-million Euro contract to 
Alcatel-Lucent from the Egyptian mobile operator Mobinil, to expand its wireless 
network. Vendors reporting a significant run of new deals at the show include 
Oracle, HP, Avaya, Sun Microsystems, IBM and Fujitsu Siemens Computer. <br>
<br>
Helal Saeed Al Marri, Director General, Dubai World Trade Centre (the organiser 
of the event), said: “GITEX has a strong record of facilitating business 
development, and this year’s show – particularly with the new innovations that 
have enabled companies to focus on their key potential customers – has further 
developed its positioning in this area.” Over 3,300 companies participated in 
the event to meet with potential and existing customers and many have brought 
the latest hardware and software to display on the show-floor.<br>
<br>
<b>Technology showcase <br>
<img border="0" src="../2007_oct/special_report1.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>Given the volume of trade visitors, many companies have opted to host the 
regional launch of key new technologies at the show. Samsung unveiled its 
expanded range LCD TV products highlighting new technology that doubles the 
contrasts ratio and offers crystal clear visuals. IT distributor Trigon 
displayed the world’s smallest battery-operated portable scanner, a product 
which is poised to make its way into the Guinness Book of Records, while 
SanDisk, the world’s largest supplier of flash data storage card products, 
showcased its cutting-edge SSD product, a revolutionary alternative to the 
traditional hard drive. <br>
<br>
i-Mate, with the help of its own ‘technology evangelist’, drew significant 
attention with the launch of its new Ultimate series of mobile phones. Juniper 
Networks got attention with its high-performance network infrastructure, which 
enables companies to deploy services and applications over a single network. <br>
<br>
This year, new companies – and first time exhibitors in particular – made a 
splash. Over 570 companies took part for the first time and they included 
Blackberry, Harman House, HCL Technologies, NEC Philips and UTStarcom. WinSoft, 
a multilingual software provider, launched its latest version of its Tasmeem 
Arabic design tool. In fact, there has been a marked increase in the levels of 
localisation and innovation offered by regional technology groups.<br>
<br>
“We’ve been thoroughly impressed by the show, and we’ve been able to network 
with a higher number of quality decision-makers than ever before. Many of the 
new innovations, like the Priority Club, have put us in direct contact with 
high-level customers. This reinforces the business development potential of this 
event,” said Husam Dajani, Senior Vice-President, Oracle Middle East and Africa.<br>
<br>
<b>Innovative format<br>
</b>“The success of this year’s GITEX Technology Week has been driven by the 
strategic reformatting of the event, which caters to the needs of the high 
number of senior decision makers attending the show. With new innovations such 
as the Global Conference networking sessions and CxO lunches, and our new 
Priority Club service, we have been able to roll out a programme that ultimately 
provides exhibitors and visitors with an increasing return on their investment,” 
said Helal Saeed Al Marri of Dubai WTC.<br>
<br>
Oman’s leading m-Commerce firm, Knowledge Oasis Muscat-based Infocomm, too 
participated in the event. Singaporean entrepreneur and Infocomm’s MD, Karim 
Rahemtulla said, “We were besieged with quality enquiries – people literally 
queued up one after the other to see our WiFi, M-commerce e-Learning and 
e-Gaming solutions.”<br>
<br>
Infocomm signed an MOU to provide a full turnkey WiFi solution for 7i, the 
Saudi-based ISP. This is the second venture between the two companies since they 
meet at GITEX last year. 7i has also shown keen interest in Infocomm’s 
e-Learning content. In an effort to reach a broader international audience and 
spread news of Knowledge Oasis Muscat’s (KOM) continued expansion, the Park’s 
management participated at GITEX. A multi-million Rial expansion has recently 
opened on KOM, the Rusayl-based technology park. According to Mohammed Al 
Maskari, KOM’s Director General: “The RO3.8 million (US$10.4 million) expansion 
programme provides an additional 10,000 square metres of office accommodation to 
support established and developing hi-tech businesses. Amongst a number of new 
tenants from Europe and the Middle East, the Park’s recently opened office space 
is home to Microsoft, Motorola, Qatar Airways and the Information Technology 
Authority (ITA).” </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

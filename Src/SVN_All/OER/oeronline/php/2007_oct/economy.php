<b>With Oman’s industrial base increasing rapidly, energy hungry projects coming 
on line, and tourist numbers expected to double in the coming decade, the 
Sultanate’s electricity sector is going to be under pressure to perform, writes 
Jason J. Nash</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="economy.jpg" width="121" height="419" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Oman’s electricity sector, both state and private, is racing to meet surging 
demand fuelled by increasing industrialisation, strong growth in commercial 
services, an expanding population and a burgeoning tourism sector. <br>
<br>
On August 13, a report by Oman’s Authority for Electricity Regulation (AER), the 
sector’s watchdog established in 2004, said the Sultanate’s power requirements 
would grow by 9 per cent a year between now and 2013. This predicted increase in 
demand is more than three times the international average, with global 
requirements expected to rise by around 3 per cent annually over the next 
decade. <br>
<br>
According to the AER’s annual report for 2006, issued in the beginning of 
September, so far Oman’s electricity sector is winning the race. Last year saw a 
10.3 per cent increase in supply compared to the output in 2005, with 10.5 
terra-watt hours (TWh) delivered through the grid in 2006, up on 9.5 TWh 
delivered the year before. Offsetting this, around 18,000 new customers were 
added last year, an increase of 3.4 per cent, the report said. <br>
<br>
Recognising that electricity generation and supply is at the core of the 
country’s drive to diversify its economy and spread the Sultanate’s industrial 
base away from around Muscat, the government has moved to bolster management of 
the sector. <br>
<br>
Only days after the AER issued its annual report, Sultan Qaboos announced a 
major shake up of the cabinet and the setting up of a number of new agencies and 
ministries. The September 9 reshuffle had a direct impact on the electricity 
sector, with a royal decree establishing the Public Authority for Electricity 
and Water, to be headed up by Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Mohammed al Mahrouqi. 
Previously, utilities had come under the Ministry of Housing, Electricity and 
Water, but the overhaul of roles and responsibilities saw these two functions 
stripped away from the ministry, which has been left with the sole task of 
overseeing the Sultanate’s housing issues. </font></p>

<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">The new authority will be given the job of conducting all state-related business 
with the sector and will have all the funding and assets formerly held by the 
ministry transferred to it. Though another decree will have to be issued to set 
out the system of the authority and management of its affairs, one of the tasks 
the new body will have is to work with the industry to cut losses and increase 
income.<br>
<br>
<b>Closing the demand gap</b><br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="economy1.jpg" width="319" height="260" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>One area where officials have seen the opportunity to help close the gap between 
supply and demand is targeting losses through transmission or from the 
unregistered use of electricity, which between them have reduced the amount of 
power available and payments that could be channelled back as investments in the 
sector. <br>
<br>
In its annual report, the AER said that while there had been a significant 
increase in the amount of electricity delivered, electricity losses remained 
high, specially in the north of the country and in Muscat itself. <br>
<br>
According to the AER, 22 per cent of the electricity entering the Main 
Interconnected System (MIS) was lost in 2006. Though this was slightly down from 
23.9 per cent lost the previous year, with savings of US $6.9million, it still 
represented a massive drain on the Sultanate’s resources. <br>
<br>
The situation was not as dire in the Sultanate’s rural and remote regions, which 
are served by the Rural Areas Electricity Company SAOC. Away from built up 
areas, losses in 2006 were just 12 per cent, down marginally from 12.3 per cent 
that leaked away in 2005. <br>
<br>
This was somewhat offset by an increase in losses in the Dhofar Governorate, 
which is served by the Salalah Power System, with 18 per cent of generated power 
in the increasingly industrialised region being lost, up 3 per cent from 2005.<br>
<br>
While the rise in output in 2006 was able to keep pace with increasing demand, 
further investments in generating capacity are needed. However, the level of 
funding could be reduced if losses through the grid, illegal siphoning off of 
power and poor metering practices were rectified.<br>
<br>
Oman has been a regional leader in privatising its utilities, with much of the 
country’s electricity generating, transmission and distribution capacity now 
operated by private firms, usually in partnership with the state. Though these 
partnerships have proved highly successful in terms of increasing output and 
investment, the firms have been told in no uncertain way by the AER to lift 
their game with regard to reducing losses. <br>
<br>
“While some degree of technical losses is unavoidable, non-technical losses are 
a source of inefficiency that increase total supply costs and electricity 
subsidy,” it said in its report. “The authority hopes these problems will be 
addressed when the existing contracts are replaced with new and more appropriate 
contracts.”<br>
<br>
Among the planned remedies identified by AER, stemming from consultations with 
supply and distribution companies, are modernising electricity meters, enacting 
a system of fines for clients found to have tampered with their meters or who 
are illegally draining off power from the grid, and employing skilled meter 
readers.<br>
<br>
A higher level of maintenance of distribution lines and other technical upgrades 
was also called for to further reduce losses. <br>
<br>
The AER has set the objective of reducing losses by half within five years, 
announcing it will include loss reduction targets in its new distribution and 
supply price controls programme as of the beginning of next year. If these 
targets are met, Oman’s electricity companies will be benefit from higher 
returns and from state assistance. If not, the companies and the Oman economy 
may both suffer.<br>
<br>
<b>Enlarging the grid</b><br>
Oman is also looking beyond its borders to solve its electricity problems. The 
government was an early supporter of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) Grid, a 
multi-national project which when completed in 2010 will link the electricity 
network of Oman with those of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the UAE.<br>
<br>
The aim of the US$7 billion project is to reduce the need for reserve capacity 
and to boost supply security against outages by interconnecting the transmission 
and generation capabilities of the GCC member states.<br>
<br>
Oman’s push to improve electricity supply and production was hindered by Cyclone 
Gonu, which swept across the Sultanate in early June, leaving a trail of 
devastation and death in its wake and causing an estimated US$2.5 billion damage 
to the country’s infrastructure, including the electricity network. <br>
<br>
Damaging to both the economy and the power grid Gonu may have been, but it also 
served to reinforce the need for worst-case scenario planning, with new 
infrastructure projects having even higher standards set for them. <br>
<br>
Oman has a number of new power stations either under construction or in the 
planning stage. Most of these have an associated desalination plant, with the 
joint facilities intended to meet two of the country’s most pressing needs. 
Other power stations, such as that at Dhofar, are being upgraded to increase 
capacity and reliability. <br>
<br>
However, with Oman’s industrial base increasing rapidly, many energy hungry 
projects coming on line, and tourist numbers expected to double in the coming 
decade, the Sultanate’s electricity sector is going to be under pressure to 
perform. <br>
<br>
Oman’s power sector had a good year in 2006, now it needs another decade of 
similar performance in order to ensure that the bright lights of the country’s 
economy don’t flicker. <br>

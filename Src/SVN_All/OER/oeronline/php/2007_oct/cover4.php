</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Firing Up Your Brand<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Your customer universe encompasses 
much more than the people who buy your product or service; it means everyone 
that comes into contact with your brand and your company. The power has shifted 
to the consumer, writes Anthony Ryman<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="cover7.jpg" width="200" height="235" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The world of public relations can be fraught with a lot of hot air, misguided 
notions and, above all, column inches. As Lord Leverhulme, founder of Unilever, 
once said, “half the money on advertising I spend is wasted, the problem is I 
don’t know which half.” Can the same be also said about PR?<br>
<br>
It is important to understand that the “public” is not just your customer. Let 
me rephrase: your customer universe encompasses much more than the people who 
buy your product or service. When companies talk about audiences, they usually 
mean the customer.<br>
<br>
When we talk about audiences, we mean everyone that comes into contact with your 
brand and your company, and this includes investors, customers, suppliers, 
employees (and their families!), opinion leaders, influencers and the general 
public.<br>
<br>
Your reputation is everything. Quality products and services, high integrity and 
transparency are the keys to success.<br>
<br>
<b>Company as a brand<br>
</b>Your company is your brand. Your brand is your reputation. PR focuses on 
maintaining and communicating and protecting your reputation.<br>
<br>
You may remember there was a scare about eight years ago in Belgium when people 
got sick after drinking Coca-Cola and there were rumours of a toxic batch. 
Coca-Cola, at first, denied there were any impurities in its product – denial is 
often the first manifestation of refusing to acknowledge a fundamental truth: 
ostrich in the sand mentality! “For 113 years, our success has been based on the 
trust that consumers have in that quality. That trust is sacred to us,” 
responded the then Coca-Cola CEO Ivester.<br>
<br>
His statement came after four European countries – Belgium, France, the 
Netherlands and Luxembourg – started taking Coca-Cola drinks off their shelves. 
But with Belgium banning, Coca-Cola, the company changed its tune and its crisis 
management machinery kicked in: Coca-Cola ‘regretted’ the incident and 
acknowledged that the company’s Antwerp factory had used the wrong type of 
carbon dioxide gas that gives Coca-Cola its fizz, making the drink taste bad, 
and that a fungicide had caused some contamination at its factory in northern 
France. You can imagine how fast Coca-Cola’s shares plummeted. This reinforces 
the truth that what you communicate about your company and your brand must be 
not only compelling, but believable and most importantly, true for you to gain a 
positioning and differentiation that sets you apart from your competitors. Also, 
if you fool the public or make them an offer that is unacceptable, they will 
walk away in droves.<br>
<br>
The real power of successful brands is that they meet the expectations of those 
that buy them, i.e., they represent a promise kept. A brand is a contract 
between a seller and a buyer: if the seller keeps to its side of the bargain, 
the buyer will be satisfied; if not, the buyer will look elsewhere. A strong 
brand creates strong positioning and differentiation.<br>
<br>
People remember strong brands and great customer experiences. The strength of 
your brand is key to your earnings potential and your market share.<br>
<br>
<b>Asset value of brands<br>
</b>“In the twenty-first century, branding ultimately will be the only unique 
differentiator between companies. Brand equity is now a key asset”. (Source: 
Fortune)<br>
<br>
The asset value of brands is now on the balance sheet. Brands generate 
high-quality earnings that directly affect the performance of the business and 
thus influence the share price. The stock market value of Coca-Cola in 2002 was 
$136 billion, yet the book value (the net asset value) was only US$10.5 billion. 
So the business value or “brand value” was US$125 billion. Maintaining this 
value depends on your customers’ continuing confidence and experience of your 
brand and your ability to manage these profitably. (Source: Interbrand)<br>
<br>
Another disastrous PR affair was the case of Dasani, a bottled ‘pure’ water 
brand. Coca-Cola launched Dasani, positioning it as a pure, clean mineral water. 
However, consumers soon discovered it was tap water bottled not far from London! 
The brand was taken off the shelves a few months after launch to great public 
and media outcry. Naturally, this did not help Coca-Cola’s brand image! Believe 
me I am not against Coca-Cola in any way, but these two incidents highlight how 
important it is to maintain brand integrity with all your customer dealings – 
both internally and externally.<br>
<br>
The latest hullabaloo in bad public relations and not keeping your finger on the 
pulse of consumer is the logo for the London Olympics 2012.*<br>
<br>
Here, there was no crisis management scenario and hence no one knew really what 
to do when public outcry reached epidemic proportions. What is clear, however, 
is that both LOCOG and to a degree, in their brand advisors Wolff Olins, were so 
far removed from the urban myth, that is the London ‘street cred’, that 
presented us with an identity which was very obviously ‘now’ but one that had no 
relationship to the pride and heritage that is the very essence of London and 
its citizens. This was another example of not speaking the truth, in this case 
not representing the soul or DNA of London and its people. Hence, the uproar 
that has, in PR terms, turned into a fiasco and surely heads will roll.</font></p>

<br>
<b>The big idea<br>
</b>All communications must come from a central core, the essence or soul of 
your organisation. We call this the “BIG IDEA”. Its what sets you apart from 
your competitors. It defines who you are, what you stand for. It gives you a 
voice, an attitude, a reason to ‘be’. It gives customers and staff a reason to 
believe, to belong to your brand, your ‘tribe’. It is authentic, transparent and 
true. Communicating your “BIG IDEA” consistently gives direction, motivation and 
clarity to your staff and customers and this leads to increased market share, 
growing new business with less effort and less cost, and most importantly happy 
staff and customers.<br>
<br>
One cannot underestimate the power of your staff as brand ambassadors to endorse 
and buy into your company, adding value to your offer and building the brand, or 
‘tribe’. Likewise, one cannot underestimate the power of your customers to 
endorse and become advocates of your company or tell everyone how bad you are. 
In these days of blogs, vlogs, podcasts and texts, not to mention the social 
networking phenomenon that is Myspace or Facebook, the power has shifted to the 
consumer. It is no longer acceptable to communicate with your customer from a 
transaction-led perspective. Now, companies must work together with their 
increasingly vocal and brand-aware audiences, to listen to their needs and 
aspirations and then provide them with the service or product they are looking 
for. We live in interesting times. PR is as much more about listening and 
engaging than it is about talking, for as the wise man once said “credibility is 
very much like virginity. Once you lose it, it is impossible to regain.”<br>
<br>
*The London 2012 Olympic Games logo has been widely criticized. The critics have 
slated the £400,000 cost of researching, developing and designing the logo and 
described the result variously as “a broken swastika” and “gobbledygook”.<br>

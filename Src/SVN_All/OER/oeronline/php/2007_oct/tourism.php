<b>The tourism industry is all set to take off with new projects’ investments 
running into billions of rials. But where is the manpower to manage the sector’s 
growing demand? Sarada Vishnubhatla and Kimberly Rodrigues look at the real 
picture</b><br>
<br>
The outlook for the tourism sector is bright in the Sultanate of Oman for the 
next few years to come. The Middle East is on the verge of an investment 
extravaganza in the tourism sector unlike anything the global industry has ever 
witnessed. At least US$1trillion will be poured into hotels, resorts, 
attractions and associated infrastructure between now and 2020 and Oman is 
riding high on the wave. Oman is actively promoting itself as an adventure 
holiday destination. It’s also pushing its potential for medical tourism, using 
its hospitals and health facilities, to draw international visitors needing 
specialised care. According to Global Futures and Foresight report released in 
early May, the GCC region will see the capacity of its airports increase by an 
extra 300 million passengers; another 200 hotels built adding 100,000 beds and 
the number of visitors rises to 150 million. These figures are based on projects 
already announced and do not take into account developments that have yet to 
make it to the planning stage.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="tourism1.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Policy makers and His Majesty have made suitable budgetary plans in the Economic 
Vision 2020 to push the country forward, spearheaded by the tourism sector. Year 
2007 is the mid-point. This sector is recognised as one of the most important 
ones that will pump in revenue for a flourishing economy, independent of oil and 
gas reserves and the revenue produced thereby.<br>
<br>
The Government has also amended a number of laws and regulations to attract 
foreign investment in this sector. And the country looks towards the vibrant 
private sector to help it keep in pace with the overall development and growth.<br>
<br>
<b>Grand objectives</b><br>
The tourism industry witnessed an all-time high in the last couple of years. The 
high occupancy rates the hotels witnessed in 2005 gathered an even higher 
momentum in 2006. Oman’s fast-expanding portfolio of hotels and hotel apartments 
posted very encouraging performance, wresting the initiative from other tourist 
destinations in the region. The further objectives of the tourism sector include 
encouraging the role and contribution of the private sector, development of 
human resources within the sector and raising the percentage of Omani work 
force. The sector’s contribution to the GDP is aimed to grow to 3 per cent by 
2020.<br>
<br>
The value of local and foreign private investment during the Sixth Five-Year 
Plan amounted to RO113 million. The private sector, supported by the incentives 
provided by the government, managed to implement projects worth RO90 million. 
The major projects include Barr Al Jissah Resort, the first stage of Mirbat 
Resort and the Chedi Resort, in addition to a number of hotels in different 
parts of the Sultanate. The government offers packages, incentives and tax 
exemptions to private sector players willing to invest in the tourism sector. As 
far as overseas investors are concerned, the government has allowed them to own 
properties in tourism projects.<br>
<br>
Going by Vision 2020, the sector is driven by a few key aims:</font></p>

<img border="0" src="tourism3.jpg" width="177" height="257" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The role of the private sector in the national economy in general and in the 
tourism sector in particular, is vital. The private sector is expected to come 
forward to invest in different tourism related activities so that the government 
can focus on building infrastructure and create a favourable environment for 
international investors.<br><br><b>Manpower needs</b><br>Market projections indicate that a total of US$10 billion is going to be pumped 
in tourism and related projects such as The Wave, Yitti Resort, Al Sawadi Resort 
(first stage), Merbat, Sefeyah Resort, Shinas Resort, etc. in the coming years. 
The tourism industry is already feeling the heat with the shortage of trained 
and experienced professionals. With number of hotel rooms expected to double in 
the next three years, from where the industry is going to source its manpower 
requirement? With similar or higher growth taking place in the regional market, 
the demand for industry professionals is already at an all time high outside 
Oman as well.<br><br>Currently, more than 50 per cent of the hotel employees are expatriates. There 
are very few training colleges in Oman that provide tourism-related training and 
they also have limited capacities. For example, the Oman College for Tourism had 
just 181 students in 2005-06. <br><br>
<img border="0" src="tourism4.jpg" width="176" height="266" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Speculating about the future of the industry, Robert MacLean, Principal of 
National Hospitality Institute, says, “Within a span of two to three years, 
there is going to be a demand of around 6,000 hotel rooms in Oman and 
approximately one to one-and-a-half staff will be required per room”. <br><br>Though the training institutes have trained thousands to create industry 
professionals so far but their capacity is not good enough to meet the demand in 
the future. <br><br>Training institutes see this development as a big challenge and the pressure is 
on them with regard to the type of training imparted to the candidates and the 
kind of workforce and professionals they are expected to deliver based on the 
needs of the client because customers now have very high standards, says 
MacLean. <br><br>He adds, “Our strategy now is to develop courses on a higher level which include 
the latest ideas and methods in hospitality training. At present, we are 
training our candidates in Opera, a latest front office reservation system. 
Candidates are chosen not only for a specific skill but also for their 
particular mindset”. </font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5">
<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Battling shortage</b><br>As Oman is experiencing an economic boom, many prospective candidates for the 
hospitality industry have joined other sectors like retailing and IT. Therefore, 
though the numbers are available, training institutes are left to convince 
students to pursue a career in the hospitality industry. The National 
Hospitality Institute goes about this task by talking to students in the 
interiors of the country, encouraging them through advertising and brochures, 
making a visual impact via the television and internet, conducting fun 
competitions, emphasising the fun side of a hospitality job, providing job 
security after training as well as re-designing and making the uniforms 
attractive. <br><br>Desmond Hatton, GM, Shangri La Barr al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa, says, “It is an 
issue to find employees not just in Oman but in the international market also. 
It is becoming more and more difficult. The traditional feeder markets for 
employees are offering equally good opportunities to their locals. Currently we 
have around 47 nationalities. We have to sit back and re-evaluate from where the 
people are going to come.” <br><br>On the way forward, he says, “Oman needs to develop more stress on English in 
the curriculum in the school. We need to get a training institute directly 
related to a hotel. The new kids that come from the training institutes don’t 
have much real practical experience. We should work towards a system where the 
students study for three days in the institute and three days in the hotel. 
That’s what we have done in Europe.” <br><br>Adding further, he says, “We are looking at the feasibility of starting our own 
hospitality training institute. We have one in China. It will be a win-win 
situation, not just for us but for other new upcoming projects as well.”<br><br>Many employers in the hotel industry are now seeing the value of employing 
locals as customers want to experience the rich culture of Oman directly. This 
has led to a strong local base in many hotels on a variety of ranks. As MacLean 
says, “Oman is chosen as a location over others in the Arabian Gulf due to the 
country’s rich and unusual culture. Therefore, many employers now see employing 
Omanis as a strong selling point for their hotel.” </font></p>

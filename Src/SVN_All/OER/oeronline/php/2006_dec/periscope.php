<b>Global Markets: Economic And Strategy Themes <br>

The slowdown in the American economy could see both oil and gold rising again in 
the next year even as the benign backdrop for US interest rates acts as natural 
nirvana for emerging market shares</b><br>

<img border="0" src="priscope.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="135" height="199">I</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">t is now obvious that the American 
economic supertanker has lost its momentum as housing starts and building 
permits plummet, and the construction sector’s woes continue to deepen. This 
means that GDP growth, which slowed dramatically all summer to 1.6 per cent in 
Q3, will remain anaemic in 2007. Apart from housing, the production declines in 
Detroit mean that the auto industry will be a drag on GDP growth. The American 
slowdown is reflected in the US$20 fall in crude oil prices, the new bearish 
trend in copper (almost half of US copper demand derives from residential 
housing growth, which is in deep peril) and, above all, interest rates. Note 
that the yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note peaked in June at 5.22 
per cent (a month ahead of US$78 oil, not coincidentally!) and the price of 
money in Uncle Sam’s IOUs has now fallen to 4.6 per cent. This dramatic fall in 
oil prices and interest rates was a valuation steroid shot for large cap 
American shares. Hence, the unexpected, strong bull market that has led the Dow, 
the S&amp;P500 index and NASDAQ higher by 12-15 per cent in a mere four months.<br>
<br>
It is, of course, axiomatic that inflation peaks follow economic slowdowns, so a 
rate hike is not at all a probable scenario. In fact, if GDP growth is 2 per 
cent, the Bernanke Fed may well be tempted to do a policy U-turn and begin its 
first rate cut. In any case, I believe the 5-year Treasury note can fall 200 
basis points, as the 10-year yield falls to 4 per cent. The world’s central 
banks, led by the Peoples Bank of China, the Bank of Japan, the Russian Central 
Bank and SAMA, are now holders of a trillion-dollar hoard in US Treasury 
securities. While Asian central banks may increase their holdings of euro, 
British pound and sterling at the margin, there is no credible alternative to 
the greenback given the scale of central bank reserve accumulation necessitated 
by the US current account deficit and the Chinese as well as Arab Gulf foreign 
exchange pegs to the dollar. A slowing American economy will also dampen the 
hawkish tightening instincts of the Bank of Japan and the ECB, postponing 
monetary tightening and enabling the dollar to fall gently against the world’s 
Eurocurrencies.<br>
<br>
What are the implications of the above scenario in the financial markets? One, 
American interest rates will continue to decline. Two, gold could well rise to 
US$680 or even challenge May’s high against the dollar. Three, the dollar fall 
will be particularly marked against the euro. Jean Claude Trichet’s ECB will 
inevitably raise intere</font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt"><b><img border="0" src="priscope1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="208"></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">st 
rates by 50 basis points as long as Euro zone GDP accelerates to 2 per cent amid 
wage increases and persistently rapid growth in the money supply. Four, the 
bullish zeitgeist for American, European and emerging markets equities will 
continue. After all, if US$87 per share earnings on the S&amp;P500 index is assumed, 
Wall Street trades at a valuation of 16 times earnings. This valuation is not 
excessive at a time of strong profit margins, liquid balance sheets, M&amp;A mania, 
dividend increases and share buybacks.<br>
<br>
The European stock markets offer the best combination of value and growth, 
particularly in Switzerland, Germany and Britain. Moreover, it appears as if 
higher beta technology and financials will lead the rally, as they have done on 
Wall Street since July. It is extremely unwise to underestimate the power of hot 
money and improved fundamentals to turbo charge the market cap of even the 
megacap shares on the NYSE and NASDAQ. So Cisco rose from 19 to 27 in the last 
six months. Goldman Sachs rose from 138 to 195 in the same time. Microsoft has 
risen from 22 to 29. Since the current bull cycle in global shares began in 
2000, Russia’s RTX index has soared from 200 to 1700. A benign backdrop for 
American interest rates is naturally nirvana for emerging market shares. Note 
Hong Kong, Mexico and Brazil, three emerging markets highly correlated to the 
10-year T-bonds breakout since July.<br>
<br>
The year 2006 will go down in history as an annus horribilis for GCC stock 
indices, particularly Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul and UAE’s DFM, which fell by 50 per 
cent and 62 per cent from their respective highs. It is still too early to 
bottom fish in the GCC share markets though Omani banks, Kuwaiti telecoms and 
UAE property financier (Tamweel) offer excellent value at current levels, 
particularly as lower dollar interest rates assist its product rollout and 
market share. Japan has emerged from its deflation spiral and “lost decade”, EU 
growth was actually higher than the US in H2 2006 and India and China GDP growth 
will actually accelerate.<br>
<br>
So, I doubt if we will see a bear market in oil. The Kremlin’s hawkishness on 
mega contracts with Shell and Exxon on Sakhalin means that Putin is determined 
to use the threat of government intimidation to promote Russian energy 
interests. Nor do Saudi Arabia and OPEC have any incentive on quota cheating or 
a bear spiral in oil prices. The world is still operating on a tight two million 
barrels in spare production capacity and the risks of either a supply shock or 
geopolitical flare-ups are not reflected in US$55 a barrel crude oil. In fact, 
as the endgame of the Putin era approaches with the Duma and presidential 
election, crude oil may well incorporate a US$10 Russian supply shock premium. 
It is therefore not inconceivable that oil prices may rise to US$70 in the next 
12 months.<br>

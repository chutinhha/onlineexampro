<b>T</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">hirty minutes in a Bentley will not 
do justice to the iconic brand itself. But when you are the only one given an 
opportunity to test-drive the spanking new addition to the Bentley fleet, you 
don’t think twice. We are talking about the newly launched Bentley Continental 
GTC, a luxurious and sporty showstopping convertible. The Continental GTC was 
launched in Oman last month and OER was the only publication that got a chance 
to take the Continental GTC for a spin. Even if it was for a very short period.<br>
<br>
The Continental GTC has been garnering much attention in the countries it has 
been launched. And how would it not? The other models from the Bentley family, 
Continental GT and the Continental Flying Spur, have been tremendously 
successful with a serious fan following. The Continental GTC only adds to the 
success of Bentley going by the sales reports in the United States and European 
markets. In fact, the Continental GTC is one of the most preferred cars among 
the sport stars in the US of A. <br>
<br>
The Continental GTC has a top speed of 195 miles per hour complemented by an 
all-wheel drive system and a 12-cylinder engine, which translates into ultimate 
driving experience. While the other models of Bentley are about superior and 
luxurious motoring, the Continental GTC is infused with a spirit of sporty and 
youthful driving without compromising on exclusivity. In the few minutes we got 
to drive the Continental GTC we experienced the convertible’s exhilarating 
performance and commendable road handling. <br>
<b><br>
Styling and Engineering</b><br>
The Bentley is a car that is associated with luxury and dynamic performance, 
among other qualities. But even before you experience a Bentley what captivates 
you is the excellent craftsmanship involved in the making of the car. To start 
with, the fascia’s symmetrical design runs along the body moving right into the 
cabin making the Continental GTC a vision of beauty. Adding to the visual effect 
of the car is the brilliantly craftsmanship inside the car. The interior of the 
convertible is covered in luxurious leather with fine wood veneers and 
accentuated with polished metal trimmings. The front seats of the Continental 
GTC have a new design, which provides more leg space for rear seat passengers.
<br>
<br>
Bentley is considered to be an embodiment of exceptional engineering in the 
automotive world, a distinction very few brands have. Right from shifting the 
physics of heavy body composition of the car to creating automobiles that not 
just felt as swift but also light as wind, Bentley engineers have go on to 
challenge themselves and produce automotive beauties that seem better than their 
best models each time. In the Continental GTC, there are many examples of this 
remarkable engineering. One aspect of the Bentley detailing that impressed us 
was the fabric roof that remained absolutely rigid and not bow or teeter when 
activated. Usually fabric roofs in many convertible models have a tendency to 
droop or bob when pulled up. You obviously cannot even visualise a Bentley with 
such a flaw. The roof folds elegantly into the stowage area in only 25 seconds, 
another Bentley engineering feat. Incidentally, the Bentley looks good with the 
roof up as well as down. <br>
<br>
The Continental GTC is perceived as an intelligent car as it has the ability to 
adapt and perform according to the settings made by the owner. Getting into the 
settings could endanger the space for this write-up as the Bentley has been 
engineered to store 150 settings right from seat adjustment to steering wheel to 
bluetooth compatibility to speed control and much more. In short, like one of 
the Bentley managers said, there’s something to discover during every drive you 
make in the Continental GTC.<br>
<b><br>
On the Road</b><br>
There was no need for the key to start the Continental GTC as it works on the 
technology of using a START/STOP button, a feature in the other models of the 
family. As you push the START button the inimitable roar of the engine coming to 
life is exciting and only intensifies your desire to step on the gas! With just 
20 minutes to go before giving back the Continental GTC, we decided not to waste 
time and hit the favourite track of car enthusiasts — the Qantab and Barr Al 
Jissah stretch. As the convertible moved along it was hard not to notice the 
smoothness and agility with which it glided. Even on gaining high speed the 
automotive provided an effortless driving experience. <br>
<br>
With convertibles a challenge that many models face is in the performance when 
the roof is down and travelling at top speeds. The Bentley did not seem to be 
affected by this as it cruised along smoothly. The Continental GTC has a 
specially sculpted rear bumper and bootlid edge like the rest of its family 
members, which provides downforce and stability at high speeds. The advanced 
six-speed automatic gearbox with manual change mode combined the super luxury 
car feel with the driving experience of a sportscar. Speed and stability took on 
a new dimension in the Continental GTC as we shifted between automatic and 
manual mode. During the very short drive that we had the Continental GTC proved 
that it not only looks good but also performs equally well. The solid body of 
the car had instilled a feeling of reliability and it was tough not to test it 
at the roundabout. The convertible handled speedy turnings commendably without 
much screeching of tires. <br>
<br>
We didn’t want to the drive to end (we had barely tested out any of its 
features) but the test drive model had to go back home – Dubai – the same 
morning and we headed back to starting point with the hope that we will be able 
to do justice to the Bentley scion. <br>
<br>
In the short span of time we had the Continental GTC, the convertible proved 
itself as the young, elegant, sporty and lively member of the Bentley 
Continental family. In countries where it has been launched, the convertible has 
gained immense popularity for its precision engineering, super-model like looks 
and fast track performance. It shouldn’t take much time for the Continental GTC 
to acquire fans in Oman as well.<br>
If you have to ask how much the car costs, you probably can’t afford it... it is 
priced at RO90,000!<b><br>

        An incredible list of 116 competitors from 30 countries took part in the 
        region’s most dramatic motor sport event. Set in the rough and unique 
        terrain of the Rub Al Khali, Ulrike Lemmin-Woolfrey discovers that the 
        race is definitely not for the faint hearted</b><br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="autonews1.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="149">With 
        engines roaring, sand covering everything in sight, exhaust fumes 
        bellowing into the blue sky, and people cheering and watching intently – 
        even the uninitiated knew that they were part of something special. 
        Starting the 16th UAE Desert Challenge, the super special stage, ridden 
        out on a custom-built two kilometre track just in front of Dubai’s 
        famous landmark, the Burj Al Arab, already saw one world-champion taking 
        the crown — and all he had to do was get across the starting line. 
        Russian team Sergey Shmakov and Konstantin Meshcheyakov in the Zil Buggy 
        took home the world championship title for Russia, and completed the 
        super special stage with the Russian flag flying from their custom made 
        buggy. <br>
        <br>
        A fantastic warm up for all competitors, the super special stage is a 
        spectacle for racing enthusiasts, a chance to get close to all 
        participants in the prestigious race and an opportunity to experience 
        the different driving styles of quad-bikes, motorcycles, cars and the 
        giant trucks. For most visitors, it was the only chance to see the star 
        line-up until they made it back to the finish line in Dubai after five 
        gruelling days of desert racing.<br>
        <br>
        An international cross country rally and the first world championship 
        motor sports event ever to be held in the Middle East, the UAE Desert 
        Challenge was launched in 1991 by Mohammed Ben Sulayem, president of the 
        Automobile and Touring Club of the UAE, chairman of the organising 
        committee, and 14-time winner of the event. The challenge is the 
        penultimate round of the FIA (International Federation of Automobiles) 
        Cross Country Rally World Cup and the FIM (International Federation of 
        Motor sports) Cross Country Rallies World Championship, and as such 
        attracts the crème de la crème of drivers and riders.<br>
        <br>
        The race, held again under the gracious patronage of H.H. Sheikh 
        Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the 
        UAE and Ruler of Dubai, was sponsored by Nakheel, the premier property 
        developer behind Dubai’s most spectacular projects, such as The Palm, 
        The World, Jumeirah Islands and Dubai Waterfront. The event was also 
        sponsored by Nissan Middle East – with the Nissan Patrol being named the 
        rally’s official car — FedEx, Castrol, Hertz UAE, ADNOC, Emarat, 
        Immarsat, Gulf News and Oasis Water.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="autonews3.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="165">This year, the region’s most dramatic motor sport event saw the 
        strongest line-up of competitors ever to assemble in this part of the 
        world, all coming to compete for the World Cup and World Championship 
        titles. The incredible list of 116 competitors from 30 nations was led 
        by veterans Ari Vatanen from Finland and Carlos Saionz from Spain, 2nd 
        seed Luc Alphand, Jean-Louis Schlesser and fellow Frenchman and last 
        year’s winner Stephane Peterhansel wanting to regain his title. The bike 
        line-up was dominated by fierce competitors David Casteau from France 
        and Spain’s Marc Coma, last year’s World Champion. The event even 
        attracted a Prime Minister, Rustam Minnikhanov of Tartarstan, who 
        entered the event in the truck category, aiming to win himself a fourth 
        title in five years, only missing out last year due to non-attendance 
        because of a broken leg.<br>
        <br>
        The race is not for the faint-hearted, with five days of desert racing, 
        most of it taking place in the unique Rub Al Khali or Empty Quarter, 
        along a 2,443 kilometre trail, full of rough terrain and spectacular 
        sand dunes to be battled in the blazing heat. After the first day’s 
        racing Ari Vatanen, who has embarked on a political as well as a racing 
        career described his feelings: “During the last 50 kilometres I wished I 
        was in my seat at the European parliament. My head got too hot and had 
        gone into safety mode. It was like a piece of chewing gum.” Favourite 
        Peterhansel too had a bad day: “We crashed in a dune and lost the front 
        end of the car and, worse still, broke the steering. It is very 
        difficult to drive in the desert without steering.”<br>
        <br>
        Despite problems, or maybe because of them, the race is generally 
        acknowledged as the warm-up for the Dakar rally, the biggest and most 
        prestigious rally of them all. Testing new cars and yet unproven driving 
        partnerships under the UAE conditions gives drivers and riders a chance 
        to iron out potential problems and practice on the sand.<br>
        <br>
        The race saw its fair share of problems, most notable the crash-landing 
        of the helicopter carrying three members of the German media, with the 
        pilot and co-pilot suffering minor injuries, but luckily no other 
        casualties. The cars and bikes were battered and broken along the stages 
        of the course, with Jean-Louis Schlesser suffering two punctures during 
        the fifth stage, and two-times World rally Champion Carlos Sainz having 
        had to give up his hopes early on in the third stage because of a broken 
        drive shaft.<br>
        <br>
        In the motor bike section, Casteau started off with a virtually 
        unstoppable 24-point lead over Coma — although there were 25 points up 
        for grabs at this race, meaning he basically only had to finish the race 
        to win the world title, but a non-finish would give the crown to Coma. 
        In the end it was Marc Coma who clinched the bikes title in the Desert 
        Challenge, with David Casteau coming in second, but still taking the 
        World Champion crown.<br>
        <br>
        The host nation celebrated victory in the battle of the quads, with Atif 
        Al Zarouni taking the title for the second time in three years, and 
        Rustam Minnikhanov, Prime Minister of Tartasan, won the title for the 
        trucks for the fourth time in five years.<br>
        <br>
        The cars saw former world champion downhill skier Luc Alphand driving to 
        his first victory in the UAE Desert Challenge, with a 15 minutes and 58 
        seconds advantage over Mitsubishi team-mate and favourite Stephane 
        Peterhansel, who had five victories to his credit in the event, having 
        succeeded both as a driver and a rider, capturing the bikes title twice 
        before abandoning his bike in favour of the buggy and going on to win 
        repeatedly.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="autonews2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="165">But such is rally driving, mishaps and miscalculations can cost a day’s 
        stage and making up lost time in the particularly challenging terrain of 
        the Empty Quarter is difficult. The teams more used to the local 
        conditions, Qatar’s Middle East Rally Champion Nasser Al Attiyah 
        achieved fifth place overall, and Yayah Alhellei was the leading UAE 
        finisher in ninth place, with team mates Ahmad Bin Suqat and Obaid bin 
        Hathboor taking 11th and 13th places, respectively.<br>
        <br>
        Veteran Ari Vatanen had joked at the pre-race press conference that a 
        pact had been made to let Mitsubishi win the UAE Desert Challenge and 
        they in turn would let his Volkswagen team win the Lisbon-Dakar rally. 
        Statistics were in favour of the Mitsubishi team, which had conquered 
        the event for the last four years in a row, and seven times out of 15, 
        while only three other makes of car — Land Rover, the Schlesser Buggy 
        and Citroen — having found victory in the race.<br>
        <br>
        Turns out that Mitsubishi did win, and now the rally racing world has to 
        wait and see if the Volkswagen team can pull off the victory at the 
        Dakar rally in January.<br>

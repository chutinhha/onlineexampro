<b>Technology Contracts Decrypted: Part 2</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>

<b>L</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ast month, Saleem Ashrafi Adam of 
Trowers and Hamlins covered the concept of what Information Technology (IT) 
contracts were and took us through what IT law is and some interesting issues 
surrounding IT-related contracts. More particularly, he focused on the 
fundamentals of a contract, giving advice to the procurement division of a 
company on the safeguards it should adopt to avoid accepting the standard terms 
of any a supplier. He also addressed the pre-tender stage of high value IT 
contracts and what customers should be doing to ensure they got the best deal, 
for example, allocation of risk in instances of failure was discussed in 
considerable length. This article, the concluding part of the two-part series, 
focuses on the establishment of a service-level agreement and a service credit 
regime, the implications of failure and the crucial concept of intellectual 
property rights in IT contracts.<br>
<b><br>
Service Levels and Service Credits </b><br>
Scenario from Part 1:<br>
<br>
A new insurance company, intending to launch operations on March 1 in order to 
establish itself in a new market, launches an advertising campaign as a run up 
to the launch date. Its Billing Supplier knows this as the former’s project plan 
states that the billing system has to be live by March 1. But, the Billing 
Supplier has a problem and wants the launch date to be put deferred until April 
1. Should the Billing Supplier be liable for wasted advertising costs? And 
should it be liable for any potential lost business? <br>
<br>
If the new insurance company’s answers to the above questions are ‘yes’, then it 
will need to make sure that there is a clear Service Level Agreement (SLA) and 
service credit regime included in its contract with the Billing Supplier. When 
defining an SLA, the new insurance company should consider the following:<br>
<br>
- The SLA should contain a clear and agreed list of the services that will be 
provided to the insurance company by the Billing Supplier. The new insurance 
company should insist on clear and associated obligations to ensure that the 
services are supplied to an agreed quality and standard. For example, a clause 
like “services shall be provided to the Billing Supplier’s best endeavours” 
means little. If the parties to a contract do not know what such a clause means, 
then they should not leave it to the courts to interpret it for them.<br>
<br>
- The SLA should also explicitly and clearly contain a description of the 
services that will have to be delivered by the Billing Supplier. The new 
insurance company should also ask itself the following questions:<br>
<br>
What services will be provided and how will quality be measured (Quality 
Control)? What is the permitted deviation from quality control and what are the 
means to quantify this deviation?<br>
<br>
What time-scales are allowed for service delivery? What are the implications of 
not meeting such time-scales? (See Service Credits) <br>
<br>
Whose responsibility is it for monitoring and reporting. Should it be the 
Billing Supplier’s? If so, how can the data reported be trusted? <br>
<br>
The new insurance company should also consider stating a maximum permitted 
tolerance of service level quality and targets for re-performing inadequate 
services and time to re-perform the service.<br>
<br>
Finally, a service credit regime will need to be established for paying the new 
insurance company credits in the event of the Billing Supplier’s 
non-performance. This could be a percentage of monthly charges for performance 
below the SLAs (such as for the deviation from tolerated quality control, 
availability, failure to meet deadlines or targets according to the specified 
SLAs). The new insurance company may also want to express in the contract the 
importance of an IT system to its business. The insurance company can include in 
the service credit principles (as genuine pre-estimated loss), the concepts of 
wasted advertising costs and potential business loss for a delayed launch. 
Therefore, it is crucial that adequate legal advice is sought when negotiating 
business critical IT contracts.</font></p>

Most people have a fairly good idea about copyrights — it protects creativity 
expressed as a literary work (such as a book or play), music, pictures, movies 
and sculptures. It also, specifically, protects software, documentation and 
other materials relevant to IT.<br>
<br>
<b>What is Copyright?</b><br>
Copyright arises as soon as a work is recorded in some way, whether in paper or 
in the electronic form. Even the “look and feel” of a website or user interface 
can, in some circumstances, be protected by copyright. There is no need to 
register copyright or to add the copyright symbol “©”, although it is a good 
practice to use the symbol, particularly where the right is to be relied on 
internationally. The name of the copyright owner and the date should also be 
added. Oman Economic Review ran a comprehensive article on intellectual property 
issues more specific to Oman in its July 2006 edition and, therefore, this 
article will not consider this issue in detail. Here, the implications of the 
Free Trade Agreement between Oman and the US on copyright protection should be 
considered, especially since Oman is required to enact the FTA by next year. 
However, interested parties should seek specific advice relating to copyright 
protection provided under the FTA.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, copyright gives the owner exclusive rights over a protected work: 
essentially, these include the right to use and copy the work, and to issue 
copies to third parties. In the context of IT, the copyright owner generally 
issues licences to third parties to use software in return for either a one-off 
or a continuing payment. <br>
<br>
Copyright generally vests with the creator of the work: the author of a book or 
the writer of software code. If the copyright is created by a software developer 
for a customer under a contract, then it should be specified who owns the 
copyright. These issues cause endless confusion in the IT industry. The answer 
to any potential confusion is always to deal expressly and clearly with issue of 
ownership of copyright in the IT contract. For example, consider the following 
scenario:<br>
<br>
Bank 1 hires a software developer on a temporary basis, for three month, as a 
consultant to design and develop some software. Given the temporary nature of 
the work, Bank 1 uses the consultant’s standard terms to govern the 
relationship. The three months comes to an end and the consultant leaves Bank 1. 
After some months, Bank 1 finds that the consultant has been employed by a 
competitor, Bank 2. More worryingly, it discovers that the consultant has sold 
software developed during his time at Bank 1 to Bank 2. A review of the terms of 
contract that it had entered into with the consultant reveals that the copyright 
of all works created by the consultant vests with it. In such circumstances, 
there is very little Bank 1 can do to stop the consultant from selling his 
products to Bank 2. <br>
<br>
To avoid the above scenario, it essential that customers receive adequate legal 
advice to ensure that sufficient provisions are contained within all contracts, 
clearly specifying who owns the developed software. If a customer’s objective is 
to simply use the software, then a licence will suffice. Of course, a customer 
will need to be advised on determining that such licence meets its requirements. 
Most software can easily be copied and distributed, and where these acts are 
carried out extensively, the value of the software as an asset can be adversely 
affected and result in loss of licensing revenue for the software owner. 
Consequently, any supplier will seek to grant as limited a number of licences as 
possible–typically, for use by an individual customer alone, with no (or 
limited) rights to copy, modify or sub-license the software. Suppliers also 
often limit licences of their software by restricting use to a specified number 
of users or sites, to specific hardware or for use in conjunction with a 
specified operating system. Also, they expect upgrade fees if a customer’s use 
of the software changes. Consequently, it is imperative that a customer 
understands the scope of a licence and its implications.

If a customer wants outright right on any developed software, then relevant 
expressed wording will need to be included in the contract. The developer will 
also need to be obligated to do what is necessary to make sure the copyright 
subsists with the customer, as the diagram below illustrates: <br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
As is evident, there are a number of issues that customers and suppliers should 
consider when negotiating IT contracts. It is essential that the terms of the 
contracts should be plainly laid out in advance and customers should not 
hesitate in discussing the concept of risk allocation. Procurement divisions 
should consider undertaking an audit to ensure there are systems in place to 
avoid the outright acceptance of any supplier’s terms. More importantly, the 
standard terms of all procurement divisions should be regularly reviewed and 
updated. The concept of service levels and service credits should be clear and 
explicit in all contracts, as this is the basis on which the customer shall have 
the right to claim for delays in delivery without heading for the courts. The 
principle of intellectual property rights in IT contracts is also very critical 
and the scenario above depicts the dangers associated with not having clearly 
covered the copyright ownership issue in a contract.</font></p>

      <b>Quick Tip</b><br>
      Even if a customer’s standard terms are used, there should be additional 
      safeguards in place to avoid accepting a supplier’s terms by accident. One 
      safeguard can be to insert the following clause in the standard terms:<br>
      <br>
      “This agreement overrides and takes the place of any other terms or 
      conditions emanating from or referred to by the supplier in relation to 
      the subject matter of this agreement, including but not limited to any 
      terms and conditions printed on the supplier’s invoices, unless such terms 
      and conditions are expressly stated as an amendment to this agreement and 
      duly signed on behalf of both parties.”</font></td>

<br>
It was an intrepid initiative, aimed at changing the destiny of the Omani youth. 
Since its inception in October 2001, Sanad — a programme launched by His Majesty 
and managed by the Ministries to encourage entrepreneurship among young Omanis — 
has come a long way. En route Sanad has attracted many a laureate, including a 
recent one by the United Nations Economic and Social Committee for West Asia (ESCWA) 
for encouraging small and medium enterprises (SME). Yet, some have questioned 
its efficacy: Has Sanad really taken off in the true sense of the word? Has it 
served its purpose as intended originally? Is the programme running out of 
steam? Does it require some serious revitalisation?<br>
<br>
Before the Sanad programme
arrived on the scene, the lower-end
retail trade ( basically the grocery trade) in the Sultanate was dominated by 
expatriates. The Ministry of Manpower kicked off the Sanad programme to 
encourage local entrepreneurship, particularly among the younger Omanis.<br>
<br>
But the young Omanis may well be facing some new challenges now. From among a 
cross-section of young Omanis OER talked to, there emerged a common refrain — 
that there’s an overdose of bureaucracy at Sanad. “Sixty per cent of the time 
gets spent on dealing with the government agencies — trying to get allocations, 
trying to get things done,” rues Aimn Al-Rahbi, winner of the Intilaaqah Young 
Entrepreneur Award 2005. Aimn, a celebrity in his own right, currently runs ‘The 
Spa Bar for Men’ and another parlour for women called ‘Nails’ at Jawahar Al 
Shatti in Muscat. <br>
<br>
“How can a small enterprise afford to have PROs (public relations officers)?” 
Aimn asks. “At the Ministry, they give you the rules and tell you what these 
rules are. Sanad should have enough powers to say to the Ministry that they need 
to question the rules..”<br>
<br>
However, Shahswar G. Al-Balushi, the CEO of OPAL (Oman Society for Petroleum 
Services), disagrees that red-tape could be dragging Sanad in any way. OPAL is 
the Omani petroleum industry’s first society to be officially approved and 
registered in the Sultanate. Its membership includes all companies working and 
serving the oil and gas sector in Oman, including producers and operators, main 
contractors, vendors, suppliers, sub-contractors, local community contractors as 
well as training providers.<br>
<br>
Shahswar asserts that Sanad, as a concept, is new — both to the government as 
well as the individuals who seek its support. He explains: “There may be some 
challenges. It’s said that the Sanad team should interact with the young Omanis 
more to find out how to smooth out the process. But there are limits to where 
you can smoothen it out because it involves money; controls have to be put in 
place to avoid misuse of money etc. Moreover, the young people have to realise 
that they need to be supported in terms of knowledge and service support advice. 
The young men and women should not be in hurry. After all, it’s a life-long 
business that they are going to have.” <br>
<br>
But even Shahswar admits to the presence of bureaucracy. “But isn’t there 
bureaucracy in all aspects of businesses?” he asks. “It’s, after all, a process 
to get things done. The Ministry of Manpower is doing its best to smooth out 
things. Once this experiment (Sanad) becomes a full-fledged process, you’ll see 
some adjustments.”<br>
<b><br>
RO5,000: Is It Enough?</b><br>
First things first: Is this amount enough? This, till August, was the upper 
limit of the Sanad support. (See Interview above). “The young Omani needs more 
than RO 5,000,” asserts Aimn. “Say you are paying rent of RO300 per month. If 
you have to deposit an advance amount for one year, you end up shelling out 
RO3,600 out of that RO 5,000. You need to spend on decoration, furniture etc. 
Pay wages to your employee(s). Only then, can you plan to buy your sale stock or 
invest in the product you want to sell! But how much are you left with?” asks 
the Intilaaqah Young Entrepreneur Award winner. “May be just enough to set up a 
small coffee shop at Muttrah,” he points out.<br>
<br>
In fact, Aimn too had mulled over whether to approach Sanad. But the RO5,000 
limit put him off. He says this sum can make one dependent — and not 
independent. “If we are trying to capture the high end of the market, the young 
Omani certainly needs more than RO5,000.”<br>
<br>
Yahya Hameed Al Ghasani has a similar story to tell. He was assisting his 
father’s business when he decided to branch out and start his own business 
(water supply at Ruwi). “I got RO5,000 from Sanad — but just office decoration 
gobbled up the entire amount. I had to invest RO20,000 overall. So the Sanad 
fund did not suffice at all,” he laments.<br>
<br>
This amount should be hiked to at least RO7,000, says Affan Fadhel Al Tamimi, 
who runs a foodstuff shop at Bousher in Muscat, and started his outlet with 
Sanad help. “I ended up spending 80 per cent of the RO5,000 in the first two 
months only after starting my venture,” he rues. “The suppliers were not really 
helpful earlier. I had to buy things in cash from hypermarkets and wholesale 
markets. It’s only now, during this Ramadan, that I started getting items on 
credit,” he adds. <br>
<br>
However, Adil Ghouse, General Manager, Consumer Products Group, Khimji Ramdas, 
points out that the loan part was meant only for the initial phase of the Sanad 
programme. “In any case, this business does not require huge investment. I don’t 
think a huge investment is required to open a 50-100 sq. m. grocery. Banks too
are ready to finance if a youth has a sound business proposal. They don’t have 
to go to the government for that,” he asserts. <br>
<br>
But what about future investments — after the small enterprise reaches a 
take-off stage, say after 5-10 years?<br>
<b><br>
Structural Issues</b><br>
Most of the agencies for bulk purchase are UAE based. Their lack of presence in 
Oman is a major issue, say several young Omani entrepreneurs. For example, if 
they have to buy a US-made beauty product, they’ll have to approach the UAE 
agency — though it may be cheaper for them, as businessmen, to buy the product 
directly from the US.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="sanad5.jpg" align="right" width="120" height="226" hspace="5" vspace="5">Aimn says he has brought such matters to the notice of Ministry officials. “The 
government should make it very clear to these companies that they will not be 
allowed to sell these products in Oman unless they have their agencies here 
too.” <br>
<br>
Another difficult issue for the Sanad entrepreneurs is to get Omanis to work for 
them, as the size of the fund is too small while pay expectations have risen. On 
the other hand, the government rule on the issue of the percentage of 
expatriates to be employed makes it a real ‘Catch-22’ situation, say some young 
entrepreneurs.<br>
<br>
So what is the solution? One of the young entrepreneurs has a suggestion to 
make: Hike the fee for employing an expatriate but at the same time make it 
easier to employ them; and with the extra money that will come, the government 
can impart training to Omanis in the same sector. This way, in five-six years, 
the young Omani entrepreneurs will get enough Omanis coming in to say, “Hey, we 
are looking for jobs.” <br>
<br>
One of the main problems with Sanad, points out Aimn, is the absence of a 
specialised committee to help the entrepreneurs on matters like “which markets 
to choose,” or “which areas to choose” etc. The ministry, he says, should have 
an advisorial section where they encourage people to come and get such things 
explained. “There should be a committee that will argue on your behalf, as many 
of the young entrepreneurs get too tongue-tied in a government office” he 
emphasises.<br>
<br>
“Every time you go to the ministry, you run into procedural hassles. We are 
briefed about the rules. But we are not kids. We want to know more if we want to 
be seriously involved in the business,” says Aimn.<br>
<br>
Shahswar (OPAL CEO) disagrees. “I am not in favour of encouraging continuous 
support. It’s better to put the young Omanis on the hot seat and let them find 
out solutions. They’ll make mistakes; they’ll also face problems. But the best 
way to learn is by trying to solve the problem oneself. <br>
<b> <br>
Methodology Debate</b><br>
Does the situation call for some rethink on the methodology? Shaukath H. Assadi, 
Country Manager – Lubricants, Oman Oil Marketing Company (OOMCO), believes that 
the need is to develop training centres for programmes like Sanad for the young 
Omanis.<br>
<br>
Shaukath elaborates his point further: “Motivating young Omanis — that has to be 
main goal. The training methodology should be more focused. First, the talent of 
the individuals should be identified. Then they should be trained accordingly.”
<br>
<br>
The selection of the young Omanis should be based on their aptitude, instead of 
asking them to do stuff like tailoring, driving etc. According to Shaukath, 
there is also a need to identify the various sectors where Omanisation can be 
done profitably. <br>
<br>
Bottom Line: How effective has Sanad been? “It’s is a wonderful programme,” says 
Shaukath, and adds: “But adjustments need to be made to the system. There are so 
many fresh graduates who want to only join companies like Omanoil, Shell, 
BankMuscat, Oman Mobile or Nawras. They do not want to join smaller companies. 
And there’s this other category of youth that’s not educated enough and does not 
have the expertise to work in a particular field. So, it’s our moral 
responsibility to train the young Omanis. And a number of bigger companies 
should be involved in the training process.” <br>
<b> <br>
Other Challenges</b><br>
<img border="0" src="sanad6.jpg" align="right" width="112" height="239" hspace="5" vspace="5">Adil of Khimji Ramdas believes one of the key challenges associated with Sanad 
pertains to the mindset — rather a change of mindset. “Let us see it this way. 
There is this employee who knows he has a fixed number of hours to work, that 
his income is also assured, and that his holidays are assured too. But when you 
get into something like your own grocery business, it’s a 24/7 responsibility. 
It requires very long working hours.
It requires a huge amount of attention to detail, even though it’s a small 
business.”<br>
<br>
So how does he rate the performance of the young Omanis on that count? What are 
the main obstacles? “Over the last six months, we have seen that the Omanis are 
doing very well; they are managing their businesses very well,” says Adil.<br>
<br>
For Shaukath of Omanoil, the challenge, for Sanad, is to overcome “that lack of 
energy.” Sanad programme was started with great zeal but it has slowed down, he 
says, adding, “But here’s an opportunity for the major companies and the 
government to join hands together to bring back energy and motivation into Sanad.”<br>
<br>
Aimn too is hopeful. “Oman needs to improve its business milieu, and Sanad has 
the right credentials to help in the process.”<br>
<br>
Perhaps, it’s time to reflect — both for the young individuals and
the authorities. And then, go full
throttle again with a renewed vigour. After all, youth is the future of
the nation.</font></p>

      <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 13pt"><b>“We are trying to simplify things”</b></font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin: 10"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Samer A. Al Nabhani, the Executive Director of Sanad Programme, in an exclusive 
interview with Mehre Alam, explains the point of view of the government with 
regard to the issues raised by OER in this cover story. Excerpts of the 
interview: <br>
      <i>
<br>
Is the RO5,000 amount enough? Many young entrepreneurs say it is not…</i><br>
To answer this question, let me go back to the time when the Sanad Programme was 
launched around five years ago. Now, why was this RO5,000 limit put in the first 
place? If you take the companies and establishments registered in the Commercial 
Registration, 48 per cent of them are of the size of RO5,000. Over 40 per cent 
of the projects currently in the market are those that have invested a capital 
of RO5,000 or less. <br>
      <br>
Secondly, the whole objective of Sanad is to promote self-employment projects. 
So we are focusing on projects that require micro-credit, for example the 
business of foodstuff. Thirdly, Sanad is considered to be a part of the greater 
objective of the government to promote SMEs (small and medium scale enterprises) 
in Oman. <br>
      <br>
Yes, it’s true that there are other programmes in the private and public sectors 
as well that offer a higher sum in terms of loans. And they have been of great 
help. So anyone with a sound business plan can seek the assistance of other 
financial institutions as well.<br>
      <i>
<br>
Is there any move to hike this sum in the future?</i><br>
Well, we have already done this. In August this year, the Board of Directors of 
Sanad took a decision to hike the maximum amount of loans offered from RO5,000 
to RO20,000.<br>
      <i>
<br>
But this hike is for partnerships and not individuals…</i><br>
This is for a maximum of up to four partners. The main idea is to promote 
individual initiatives and entrepreneurship among Omani graduates. It also aims 
at promoting some technical projects such as those dealing in repairing of cars 
and ACs (air-conditioners) etc. <br>
      <i>
<br>
What happens when an entrepreneur is well established? What about taking him/her 
to the next level? </i> <br>
We are working on this idea as well. As of now we have numerous possibilities on 
how to go about on this. We have seen how so many Sanad entrepreneurs have been 
doing fantastically well; they are highly motivated; they want to move higher 
and are passionate about their projects as well. Yes, they do need some more 
support. Probably we can think of teaming up with the other financial 
institutions. <br>
      <i>
<br>
Is this plan (Sanad teaming up with other financial institutions) on the cards?</i><br>
We have not taken a formal decision yet. But what I can tell you is that it’s on 
the cards. <br>
<br>
      <i>Some young Omanis talk of too much of bureaucracy at Sanad. Can the procedures 
be simplified?</i><br>
We are trying to do this. We have already signed a memorandum of understanding 
with Oman Development Bank and I think this will ease up things considerably. We 
are trying to simplify things. We are working on this. <br>
<br>
      <i>Are there any new plans afoot at Sanad?</i><br>
We are moving forward to establish a Business and Development Centre with a view 
to providing training, consultancy, and promoting entrepreneurship at different 
levels. We are working on this. Then, a Sanad Award is in the offing also. 
Hopefully we’ll&nbsp;
announce the Sanad awards by the middle of next year. </font></td>

We were tempted to start with the last question first. On a scale of 10 for 
performance, how many marks would she give to Sanad? “Seven out of 10,” says 
Sahar Al Kaabi. And there are reasons for the high marks. Sanad help came to her 
at a crucial time; when she was bogged by self-doubts. Sanad resuscitated her 
fledging business. And she has not looked back since. <br>
      <br>
Sahar didn’t start business with Sanad fund initially. She quit her job with 
Oman Aviation to start a gift items business in Assarooj Complex, Muscat. But 
she had not carried out any detailed study of the needs and requirements of the 
market and the people. For two years, she carried on — but without much success.<br>
      <br>
Then came a point when she decided to call it quits. She went to Egypt to pursue 
her post-graduation, but came back to Oman in the year 2000 without completing 
the course — and the businesswomen in her couldn’t wait any further. Only, this 
time, she wanted to be doubly sure of the cost-benefit analysis. <br>
      <br>
Thus came about the Sadaf Gallery in 2001-end, based in a villa close to her 
house. Starting with flowers and gift items, she later thought of opening a 
coffee shop exclusively for ladies in the same villa. That was when her sister 
took charge.<br>
      <br>
“But we didn’t have the money to start the coffee shop. My sister then decided 
to approach Sanad. We were asked to submit a project report — and the project 
was approved in a couple of months. My sister, an IT professional, decided to go 
abroad. Thereafter, I took up the project.” And for her huge success, she gives 
credit to Sanad.<br>
      <br>
Sahar cannot stop gushing about how Prince Charles, on a visit Oman, came 
calling to Sadaf Gallery. “Lots of Omani youths had assembled at this place. 
Prince Charles wanted to know about Omani youth projects. The media covered the 
Prince visit extensively. It was a very good advertisement for my gallery. In 
fact, I did not need to make any investment on advertising for my gallery. The 
visit of Prince Charles worked wonders.” <br>
      <br>
Sahar is all praise for Sanad officials for their readiness to solve problems. 
She has attended some training courses organised by Sanad, including one in 
Salalah the last time. “I believe one should not start any venture without 
proper training.”<br>
      <br>
She says most Omani youths need to know more about the method of starting 
businesses. “Sanad not only provides them the fund to start business with, but 
also gives them the required know-how,” she emphasises.<br>
      <br>
Sahar credits Sanad for fostering self-confidence among the Omani youth. “When 
it started, a lot of people thought we couldn’t do this kind of business because 
there were lots of expatriates in retail trade. See how things have changed 
now!”</font></td>

      <b>The concept of Sanad may be a uniquely Omani, with the element of culture coming 
in to play as well</b><br>
<br>
Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh, the winner of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has 
undoubtedly transported the term ‘micro-credit’ to the common man’s lexicon. Is 
Sanad too an example of micro-credit financing like the one championed by Yunus? 
Or is it about financing small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs)? <br>
      <br>
“It’s neither this nor that,” explains Shahswar G. Al-Balushi, CEO, OPAL (Oman 
Society for Petroleum Services). “It’s something uniquely Omani. It’s a whole 
concept of culture development. Earlier, the marketplace in Oman was being run 
predominantly by expatriates. Now, to bring the Omanis to start entrepreneurial 
activities, to take the first shop and the second and the third, and being in 
there, is a whole culture change. To move from over-reliance on the government 
sector to the private sector, and be prepared for the risks involved, requires a 
change of mindset.” <br>
      <br>
      </font>
      <img border="0" src="sanad4.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="180"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Sanad is different from the micro-credit and small and medium enterprises in the 
sense that the marketplace has changed in a fundamental way. There’s greater 
interaction between the elder and younger generations. The elderly go and sit 
with the youngsters; there’s chitchat; the families are moving in; they are 
talking to each other. It will slowly evolve a completely different culture. The 
culture change will throw up different talents in art, writing, philosophy, 
music etc. And all of this will happen because of the increased interaction. <br>
      <br>
Adds Shahswar: “Earlier, you drove your car to the small shop window, honked and 
asked, ‘Can I have milk?’ It is so different now.” <br>
      <br>
What about the SME status? Explains Shahswar: “Sanad has the element of credit 
support. When the process gets more established in future, these (Sanad) 
businesses will become small enterprises, supporting medium and larger 
enterprises and services. We have seen examples of some individuals who started 
with grocery, then went on to open a photo shop and are now planning to expand 
their business. It’s all happening.</font></p>

      <p align="justify" style="margin: 10"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The United Nations Economic and Social Committee for West Asia (ESCWA) has 
published a new study on the indicators of sustainable development in some 
Middle East countries, including Oman. The study says Oman has encouraged the 
setting up of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), by providing training courses 
and small business funding. The study specifically praises the Ministry of 
Manpower’s Sanad Programme for promoting small businesses and meeting the 
demands of many jobseekers. The programmes, says the ESCWA study, also provides 
Omani youngsters with suitable means and skills to promote their businesses 
through training and counselling. Says Samer A. Al Nabhani, the Executive 
Director of Sanad Programme: “We are delighted by the ESCWA praise. The praise 
indeed reflects the diligent work on the part of the government in boosting 
entrepreneurship spirit and culture in Oman.”</font></td>

<img border="0" src="canon_powerShot.jpg" width="120" height="165" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2"><font color="#353535">Targeted 
at the camera lovers in Middle East, Panasonic has launched a digital camera 
fully loaded with 5-megapixel, 3x optical zoom, 12x digital zoom with Leica Dc 
Vario-Elmarit Lens DMC Lumix -FX8. The camera has Panasonic’s unique MEGA O.I.S. 
(Optical Image Stabilizer) that automatically compensates for handshake while 
shooting, resulting in clear, defined images even by non-professionals. The FX8 
has been specifically designed for extended use and is ideal for amateurs 
looking for a compact, easy- to-use camera, especially on long trips where 
batteries can’t be recharged or replaced. It allows the user to take about 300 
photos in a single charge, which is more than two times longer than the 
equivalent models, as claimed by the company. The FX8’s compact size also makes 
it easy to carry: just 3.7 inches wide, 1.99 inches high and weighing only 
155grams, with battery and SD memory card. The FX8’s 2.5 inch LCD provides extra 
backlighting to ensure clear visibility even outdoors. Additionally, the camera 
is equipped with full-size VGA movie capture at 30 frames per second, while a 
builtin speaker provides an extra dimension to playback on the 2.5 inch LCD.</font></font></p><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1" width="70%">

			<font color="#515151">Canon 
Middle East (CME) has introduced the 12x optical zoom, 5.0 Megapixel PowerShot 
S2 IS. Asuccessor to the PowerShot S1, the new model features optical image 
stabilizer technology, outstanding optics and 30 fps digital video camera 
quality extended video recording of up to 60 minutes with stereo sound. It is 
powered by the same DIGIC II processor found in Canon’s pro-series DSLR cameras, 
the S2 IS features super-responsive 2.4 fps shooting, start up times and auto 
focus speeds almost twice as quick as that of its predecessor, 18 shooting modes 
and shutter speeds to 1/3200 of a second. A USB 2.0 Hi-speed interface is 
provided for super quick image and video transfers. An Ultra-low Dispersion (UD) 
lens element curbs chromatic aberrations – particularly at longer focal lengths 
– for extremely faithful colour reproduction and sharp definition. IS can be set 
to off, continuous (always on), shoot only (operates with shutter release) and 
panning mode (only up/down movement corrected – suitable for applications such 
as motorsports). Providing the equivalent of 2-3 stops, IS allows photographers 
to shoot with longer than normal exposures without increasing image blur, great 
for low light shootin at events where use of flash is inappropriate or not 
desirable – such as concerts and weddings. The camera also boasts an impressive 
software package.</font></font></p><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1" width="70%">

			</font><br>
</b><font color="#353535">Kodak Easyshare P880 zoom digital camera is Kodak’s latest offering to 
serious photographers. It provides more expansive picture-taking capability with 
a 8.0MP, 24-140mm (35mm equiv.) wide-angle, f/2.8 – f/4.1, professional-quality 
Schneider- Kreuznach Variogon zoom lens. The 24mm wide angle setting is ideal 
for landscape photography, allowing a person to get closer to subjects, while 
contributing to greater sense of place by “pulling in” foreground objects with 
greater depth of field. It’s also ideal for interior photography, where 
barriers, such as walls, typically make it difficult to get all desired subjects 
into a shot. Video takes on a new dimension with this model — a function not 
available in dSLRs. Capture VGA video at 30 frames per second (Motion JPEG 
compression) with the ability to use full optical zoom, then trim, cut, splice 
and merge clips on the camera. Even extract individual video frames as JPEGs
at 640 x 480 resolution — presenting an ultra-high-speed alternative to the 
camera’s multiple burst modes (first/ last/time lapse burst) — which can then be 
shared and printed up to 4 x 6 inches. Additional highlights include a 2.5 inch, 
high-resolution LCD; a 237,000 pixel electronic viewfinder with diopter; a 
high-capacity lithium ion battery; shutter speeds ranging from 16 – 1/4000 
second, and a bulb setting etc. It weighs 19.6 oz. (556 g), including battery 
and SD card, with a compact body.</font></font></p><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1" width="70%">

			features a 5.1MP, 12X, 36 – 432 mm (35mm equiv.), image-stabilized, 
			f2.8 – f/3.7, Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon lens to get incredibly 
			close to a scene while maintaining detail and sharpness. Optical 
			image stabilization, combined with the advanced, hybrid AF system 
			(25 selectable points), provides a 2- stop advantage over non image 
			stabilized systems for better capturing subjects in low light for 
			both still and video. It also minimizes handheld camera shake at 
			longer focal lengths, which is critical when not using a tripod — a 
			scenario found on the sidelines of sporting events, on scenic hiking 
			trails, and during everyday spontaneous picture-taking when carrying 
			a stabilizing device is impractical. The P850 model shares many 
			elements of the more advanced P880, including 30 fps VGA video with 
			single-frame still-extraction and trim/cut/ splice/merge editing 
			abilities. Other features include a unique hot shoe for extended 
			lighting control; PASMC and extensive pre-set scene modes; multiple 
			burst modes for action shooting; a live histogram; highlight/ shadow 
			clipping displays; RAW/TIFF/JPEG support; and lithium ion battery.

            Magentis to premiere in Frankfurt</b><br>
            Kia Motors is all set to launch an all-new fourdoor D-segment Sedan 
            Magentis (also known as Optima in some markets) at the Frankfurt 
            International Motor Show in September. Designed at Kia facilities in 
            Korea, the USA and Europe, the new Magentis marks the latest step in 
            the complete regeneration of the Kia product line-up over the last 
            four years. Longer, wider and higher than the previous model, and 
            with an extended 2,720 mm wheelbase, more spacious interior and 
            larger trunk, the stylish new Magentis is a thoroughly modern 
            design, engineered to give Kia a strong challenger for Dsegment 
            sales around the world.<br>
            <br>
            According to Yong- Hwan Kim, Sr. EVP and COO of Kia Motors 
            Corporation, “With the Magentis launch, we‘ll have competitive 
            models in the A, B, C and Dsegments as well as the MPV and SUV 
            sectors, maintaining the momentum of our rapid growth and our 
            ability to attract more and more new customers. With every new Kia 
            model, we have also demonstrated the growing ‘Power to Surprise’ of 
            our developing global brand.”</font></p><hr width="70%" size="1">

            to buy Reebok</b> <b>for $3.8 billion</b><br>
            Adidas has announced its plan to buy Reebok for $3.8 billion. The 
            coming together of the two giants is expected to give tough 
            competition to Nike, the market leader. Nike's annual global sales 
            touch nearly $14 billion, whereas Adidas rakes in $8 billion and 
            Reebok is pegged at $4 billion. Adidas-Salomon AG's purchase of 
            Reebok International Ltd. for $59 a share combines two major brands 
            with links to both athletics and lifestyle. <br>
            <br>
            Adidas has its strengths in soccer, track and field whereas Reebok's 
            line of sneakers and athletic gear are popular in sports like 
            football, baseball and basketball. As per market experts, 
            Adidas-Reebok combine is expected to make inroads into Nike market 
            by presenting a stronger fashion brand, which will also gain wider 
            support and endorsement deals. And when they present this united 
            brand, they will have the sheen to get more endorsements from 
            high-profile athletes. As for the separate entities, they<br>
            had a small niche but together Adidas and Reebok will have a global 
            presence to compete on equal footing with Nike. <br>
            <br>
            So far neither company has admitted to forfeiting its own brand. 
            “The brands would stay separate but complement each other,” said 
            Adidas Chairman and CEO Herbert Hainer. He added, “This portfolio 
            will present us in all the major sport categories around the world. 
            Reebok is extremely strong in the American sports like NFL, NBA and 
            Adidas is very strong in the FIFA World Cup, the Olympic Games and 
            the European Champions League.&quot;</font></p>

            Yahoo invests $1 billion in China’s Alibaba</b><br>
            Yahoo Inc. has inked an agreement to pay $1 billion and hand over 
            Yahoo! China for acquiring 40 per cent stake in China's largest 
            e-commerce website Alibaba.com. This is the largestever acquirement 
            deal in China's Internet industry so far. The combination would pave 
            way for an e-commerce giant by bringing together Alibaba's 
            business-to-business and consumer online auction sites with Yahoo's 
            search operations. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Most of the $1 billion investment will be spent on development of 
            search engines,&quot; said Ma Yun, CEO of Alibaba. As the second largest 
            Internet market in the world, China has over 103 million netizens. A 
            report from Beijing-based Analysis International estimates that 
            China's e-commerce market will reach $76.5 billion in 2005. &quot;The 
            future e-commerce must depend on on-line searching and Alibaba aims 
            at giving Chinese people access to a world-level search engine by 
            next year,&quot; said Ma. The package of Yahoo China's assets includes 
            Yahoo's search technology, the website of Yahoo China, its 
            communication and advertising business, as well as 3721.com, a 
            Chinese language search engine. Alibaba and Yahoo will aim to find a 
            search engine more powerful than Google's, informed Ma. <br>

            Noticing counterfeit LG air conditioners making their appearance in 
            a number of markets in the Middle East and Africa region, LG 
            Electronics has kick-started a copyright protection drive to protect

            business personnel and legal team in Korea and abroad. The company 
            officials are training distributors to differentiate authentic from 
            counterfeit products and warning them of the legal complications 
            that they may face for illegally trading in counterfeit goods. 
            “Counterfeiting and product fraud affects our entire industry and we 
            are concerned about the danger this poses to our consumers. As the 
            producer of the world’s best selling air conditioners, I believe LG 
            has a responsibility to lead the fight against product fraud and 
            pursue appropriate legal measures to prevent counterfeit air 
            conditioners from coming to the market. We are stepping up efforts

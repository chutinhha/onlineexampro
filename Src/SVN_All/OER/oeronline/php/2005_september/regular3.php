for mobile business in Yemen</font><br>
</b><br>
<img border="1" src="tech_tonic_omantel.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="100" height="137">Omantel 
has come second among five international and regional mobile operating companies 
short-listed for a tender to choose the third GSM mobile operator in Yemen. In 
the first stage of bids assessment based on licence value, United Telecom-Yemen 
(a Chinese consortium) topped the list. <br>
<br>
As per sources, the largest bid was of $149 million, followed by a bid of $101 
million while the lowest bid was $34.2 million. The Yemeni Ministry of 
Telecommunication and Information Technology is expected to announce the winner 
on 18 October after the final stages of bids assessment. Currently, the mobile 
market in Yemen is pegged at 1.5 million users. <br>
<br>
An Omantel spokesperson informed: &quot;Our participation in a tender for a mobile 
operator in Yemen is part of our expansion strategy in the region, especially 
after we went public and got listed on the Muscat Securities Market.&quot; <br>
<br>
According to sources, the eventual winner of the tender will have a 60 per cent 
stake in the new company whereas the remaining 40 per cent will be offered for 
public subscription for Yemenis and local financial institutions. The existing 
mobile operators in Yemen were not allowed participation in the bid and they are 
not allowed ownership in the new company.</font></p>

CyberGuard launches new desktop security appliance for SMEs</font><br>
</b><br>
<img border="1" src="tech_tonic_cyberguard.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="125" height="44">CyberGuard, the IT security solutions company, has introduced a new 
all-in-one, centrally managed desktop security appliance to protect small and 
mid-sized enterprises against both external and internal threats to their 
network. <br>
<br>
Positioned as a robust network security solution that unifies layers of defense 
and response mechanisms, the CyberGuard SG580 provides Unified Threat Management 
(UTM) functionality, including a powerful stateful-inspection firewall, 
service-based intrusion detection blocking, anti-virus protection, and 
threat-containment through Security Policy Enforcement (SPE). UTM is a new 
category of security appliances that blends multiple security features in a 
single platform. As external and internal threats grow more complex and 
malicious, UTM appliances, with the significant improvements in performance, 
value and simplicity, offer small and medium-sized enterprises the necessary 
protection to thwart today’s blended threats. <br>
<br>
“The SG580 provides comprehensive network security for the small and 
medium-sized firms in the region by consolidating an array of attack-prevention 
tools such as network firewall, sophisticated intrusion-prevention, secure VPN 
access, A/V and web content filtering onto a single device, and makes it 
affordable for small and medium-sized enterprises the kind of security that was 
once the preserve of large corporations with large security budgets,” said 
Bashar Bashaireh, Regional Manager Middle East and North Africa, CyberGuard. <br>
<br>
“As attacks become more complex and multi-layered, it becomes imperative that 
the offices of small to medium-sized enterprises, as well as branch offices of 
large enterprises, can conduct business in a secure environment, safe from 
internal and external threats to their network.”</font></p>

age robotic vacuums by LG</font><br>
</b><br>
<img border="1" src="tech_tonic_newage.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="100" height="66">LG 
Electronics has introduced robotic vacuum cleaner Roboking, positioned as 
high-end automatic domestic cleaner. Short battery life has been a drawback of 
robotic vacuum cleaners, but LG’s Roboking cleaner has a battery life that is up 
to eight times longer than the previous models. Its suction power is up to ten 
times stronger as well. C H Lee, President, LG Electronics Gulf FZE, informed: 
“Roboking raises the bar for all robotic vacuum cleaners. It offers great 
performance, underlining LG’s commitment to innovation and technological 
excellence.” <br>
<br>
LG claims that Roboking drives itself better than any other vacuum cleaner by 
using a unique direction-adjusting gyro sensor. The gyro sensor, a devise used 
in aircraft and satellite navigation, helps the 5.2-inch cleaning appliance find 
its way into every corner of the house. With Roboking’s onboard BLDC (Brushless 
Direct Current) motor, suction reaches 100 watts. Most competitor high-end 
robotic vacuums deliver suction power between 30 to 70 watts of suction power. 
The Roboking drives smart with the help of numerous onboard sensors that move 
the device in various set patterns. This allows the LG Roboking to drive around 
the house without getting stuck on furniture. Other features include a lithium 
polymer battery (Li-PB) that charges in approximately 2.5 hours and delivers an 
average battery life of three to five times longer than the competition. 
Roboking uses a five-step filtering system and a valve that prevents the 
backward flow of dust collected in the appliance. For the first time in the 
industry, the system incorporates two advanced HEPA (High Efficiency Penetration 
Air) micro filters. LG sold vacuum cleaners worth US$27 million in the Middle 
East and Africa in 2004, a 35 per cent increase over 2003.</font></p>

Gartner declares CA the leader in IT asset management<br>
</b><br>
</font>
<img border="1" src="tech_tonic_gartner.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="100" height="133">Computer 
Associates, one of the world’s largest management software companies, has been 
declared, for the third consecutive year, as the worldwide market leader in IT 
Asset Management on license revenue with a 27 per cent share by Gartner, Inc. in 
its report entitled “Market Share: Enterprise Management, Worldwide, 2004.” <br>
<br>
The Gartner report also showed that CA is the leading independent software 
vendor in the worldwide enterprise management software market, with a 14.5 per 
cent market share. The total market grew 11 per cent in 2004 to $6.2 billion, 
according to Gartner.<br>
<br>
CA has urged its regional enterprise customers to take control of their IT asset 
base to optimize IT asset utilization and improve investment returns. “Regional 
enterprise organisations are deploying the latest solutions to help them cope 
with operational growth and expansion while streamlining efficiencies to improve 
profitability,” said Maria Medvedeva, Technology Services Director at Computer 
Associates in the Arab countries. “However, regional companies need to 
proactively manage their entire IT asset base if they are to compete at 
profitably. This means better optimization of business performance, improving 
productivity, reducing risk and accelerating time to market through CA’s 
globally-leading IT Asset Management solutions, and optimizing total returns on 
substantial technology investments.”</font></p>

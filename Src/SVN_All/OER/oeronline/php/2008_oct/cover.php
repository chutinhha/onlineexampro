                her from the post of undersecretary in the Ministry of National 
                Economy. The formation of the Tourism Ministry in 2004 consolidated

                with the private sector to further develop international markets 
                for Oman tourism as tourism is going to be a principal driver 
                of the country’s economic development.”</font></p>

                    Hewitt Associates, a global human resources consulting firm, 
                    and Oman Economic Review have launched the Middle East version 
                    of Hewitt’s global ‘Best Employers’ study. Organisations can 
                    now register to participate in this study. Through this research, 
                    participating organisations will be able to measure their 
                    effectiveness in creating a workplace that both engages the 
                    hearts and minds of employees, and one that leads the market 
                    in their people practices. Interested organisations should 
                    register now on www.hewitt.com/bestemployersmiddleeast. <br>
                    <br>
                    Debabrat Mishra, Middle East Consulting Business Leader, Hewitt 
                    Associates, said: “We are very excited about the launch of 
                    Hewitt’s first ‘Best Employers in Middle East’ study. As the 
                    region is becoming extremely competitive in terms of attracting 
                    and retaining the right talent, companies need to be able 
                    to differentiate themselves. The Hewitt Best Employers study 
                    provides a credible benchmark for employers to create a competitive 
                    advantage through their people.” Given the global success 
                    of this initiative, the Best Employers in Middle East study 
                    is expected to generate a high volume of interest. <br>
                    <br>
                    Hewitt is also contributing to the ongoing efforts of regional 
                    governments to create an economic environment that is conducive 
                    to growth and yet meets the aspirations of individuals seeking 
                    positive work environments. To this end, it has partnered 
                    with United Press and Publishing publishers of Oman Economic 
                    Review to launch this inaugural study. The study is divided 
                    into six phases: registration (now open), data collection, 
                    data collation, random audits, judging, and results. Organisations 
                    that have over 100 full time equivalent employees (FTEs) and 
                    have been in business from September 2007 or earlier in their 
                    country of participation can register to participate in the 
                    study online at www.hewitt.com/bestemployersmiddleeast. Data 
                    will be collected using three proprietary tools developed 
                    by Hewitt: the Employee Opinion Survey (to gauge the level 
                    of employee engagement and gather information on employee 
                    perceptions of their work environment); the People Practices 
                    Inventory™ (to gather information about philosophies, practices, 
                    and policies that influence the management of people); and 
                    the CEO Questionnaire (to explore the alignment between business 
                    strategy and people policies).<br>
                    <br>
                    The Best Employers will be selected by an independent judging 
                    panel including representatives of academia, government organisations, 
                    the human resources profession and the business community. 
                    The judging panel evaluates information on a ‘blind’ basis 
                    whereby the judges are unaware of the identity of participating 
                    organisations until after decisions are made.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;

						than 20 years ago, the first Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur 
						of The Year Award was held in a single American city. 
						Today, the programme spans nearly 135 cities in more 
						than 50 countries. The Ernst &amp; Young Middle East 
						Entrepreneur of the Year programme replicates the 
						success that the programme has already enjoyed for over 
						22 years across the world. The Entrepreneur of the Year 
						Awards programme is an important way to recognise a 
						group of people who, too often, don’t get the 
						recognition they deserve. The Entrepreneur of the Year 
						programme recognises entrepreneurs from all across the 
						region. It also provides an opportunity to women 
						entrepreneurs who face a unique set of challenges when 
						it comes to launching their entrepreneurial career – and 
						yet, their numbers continue to increase. The programme 
						seeks to inspire entrepreneurs, whether men or women, 
						throughout the region. Interested participants can be 
						apply for the awards. On 11 October 2008, all finalists 
						will be identified and will be announced to the media. 
						Ernst &amp; Young executives in each office where there is a 
						finalist will conduct an on-site interview with each of 
						the finalists. Summaries of these interviews will be 
						sent to the programme managers no later than 8 November 
						2008. These summaries will then be placed in a judge’s 
						pack and sent to all the judges for the final winner 
						selection to be made. The judges meeting will take place 
						in Jordan at the Dead Sea from 27 November 2008 to 29 
						November 2008. Up to seven individuals drawn from 
						business executives, entrepreneurs, ministries, 
						academics and other suitable candidates will be asked to 
						participate on a distinguished panel of judges to select 
						a winner. Says Rajeev Singh, Partner, Transaction 
						Advisory Services, “While the financials of a company is 
						a consideration the judges look for an achievement that 
						is world class.” It will be the responsibility of the 
						judging panel to select and rank the top three 
						individuals in the overall Entrepreneur of the Year 
						Middle East Award. Ernst &amp; Young’s 2007 Middle East 
						Entrepreneur of The Year Award 2007 winner was Samih 
						Darwazeh Chairman, Hikma Pharmaceuticals. The 2007 
						finalists from Oman included Samir Fancy, Chairman, 
						Renaissance Services and Maqbool Al Saleh, Chairman, OHI.

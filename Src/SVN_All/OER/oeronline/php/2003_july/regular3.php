            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">PDAs to please all pockets The PDAs 
            marketplace is all about choice. The latest PDA developments include 
            a flood of combo models - PDAs that also double as cell phones, 
            digital cameras and MP3 players. And they come in all shapes and 
            sizes. More importantly, they come with a variety of price tags. In 
            a device this small, however, multi-functionality has its limits, 
            and even the most expensive models can sometimes miss the mark. For 
            the PDA-phile, OER profiles the latest available to match every 
            pocket. </font></p>

            <img border="0" src="Gizmos-PalmZireBlue.jpg" width="125" height="149" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Palm Zire Limited Edition</b>
            <br>
            Palm may have actually taken a step backwards with this 
            stripped-down model; the Zire costs little more than one of those 
            fancy paper day planners, and that seems to be the whole idea. Palm 
            is aiming to convert paper users to electronic without making a big 
            investment - and for keeping track of your contact information, it 
            does just fine. The monochrome Zire has 2MB of memory and comes with 
            basic Palm software to get you up and running, but forget about 
            playing MP3s and storing digital - this PDA doesn’t have the bells 
            and whistles. Price range: US$87 (RO33.46) - US$100 (RO38.46) </font></p>

            </b>If you use your PDA mainly for contact management - that is, to 
            keep track of the names, addresses, and to-do lists that you’d 
            otherwise write on scraps of paper - the Sony CLIE PEG-SJ20 is the 
            best basic monochrome (B&amp;W) unit. With 16MB of memory and a 
            high-resolution (320 x 320 pixel) screen, it holds thousands of 
            addresses, memos, and to-do items. Yes, it lacks a sync cradle and 
            Mac software, but it does have a rechargeable battery. The CLIE runs 
            on the Palm 4.1 OS, but doesn't morph into a cell phone or MP3 
            player like the more expensive models. Price range: US$130 (RO69.23) 
            - US$150 (RO57.69) </font></p>

            handheld computing, featuring the new Palm OS 5.0 as well as an 
            ARM-compliant 200 MHz CPU. The built-in 2-megapixel camera supports 
            UXGA resolution (1,600 x 1,200), and includes several enhancements. 
            Built-in Bluetooth technology allows you to pair your CLIE handheld 
            with other Bluetooth-compatible peripheral devices. The PEG-NZ90 is 
            also equipped with a wireless communication slot for adding an 
            optional wireless LAN (802.11b) card. Another new feature is the 
            removable lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack. Price range: 
            US$619.95 (RO238) - US$799.99 (RO307.69)</font></p>

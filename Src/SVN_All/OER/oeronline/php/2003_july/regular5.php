            managing director, BP Oman, speaks to OER about his hobbies, his

            </b><br>
            During my years 
            with BP and Shell I covered all parts of the business and for a time 
            ran a subsidiary company which had everything from civil contracting 
            to farming, motor spares and industrial cleaning. This broad 
            experience has helped give me a good appreciation of business in 
            areas not aligned to the oil industry. At the end of the day good 
            business practices are good practices whatever the business. During 
            my time with the company I have furthered my education, as I believe 
            it is essential that managers try to reinvent themselves by 
            improving their skills and keeping up with the latest trends. I have 
            also travelled and operated extensively in Southern Africa. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Describe 
            your present role at BP/Oman Oil. </b><br>
            I believe my role is to ensure an 
            atmosphere within the company where all staff feel motivated and energised to achieve the highest standards possible. This is 
            achieved by guiding, challenging, supporting and most of all by 
            communicating in an open and transparent manner with all levels 
            within the company. Managers roles are fast becoming those of 
            mentors and coaches for their teams as they do not have all the 
            answers and therefore if you want to get the best out of your staff 
            they need to feel valued and empowered. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What does the future hold 
            after the BP management contract runs its course at Oman Oil? </b>
            <br>
            A good 
            future. The company is in sound financial position, it has a well 
            trained and motivated staff who are competitive and eager to 
            succeed. We have a strong, forward looking, dedicated and supportive 
            board of directors, if you combine all of these factors you have a 
            recipe for continued success. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What has been the most rewarding 
            challenge that you have overcome? </b><br>
            Prior to coming to Oman I was the 
            MD of BP in Malawi. The government there had been responsible for 
            the importation of all petroleum products. The operation was 
            difficult as all fuel was transported by road tanker from three neighbouring countries and the department involved in the operation 
            was losing money as well as having logistical problems. By lobbying 
            the government and providing them with an alternative we managed to 
            move the whole operation to the private sector. When I left, the 
            company importing fuel was running at a profit and the oil industry 
            was in a healthy state. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which business thinkers have shaped your 
            perspective on doing business?</b><br>
            I am afraid that business thinkers as 
            a whole are interesting up to a point and then reality in many cases 
            takes over. The era of &quot;in search of excellence&quot; set the tone for 
            management gurus but none stand out particularly for me. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What is the 
            most annoying thing that a manager has said to you? How did you 
            react? </b><br>
            I have a great deal of difficulty with people who are 
            negative, primarily because being negative takes up more energy than 
            being positive and it does not promote feelings of innovation and 
            passion. I also believe that every one has a talent and when I hear 
            managers talking about poor performance from their staff it is up to 
            the managers and supervisors to find out why and then come up with a 
            solution which benefits all. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What is the most funny situation that 
            you have experienced while at work? </b><br>
            As a young salesman I pretended 
            to be the Chairman (He was an Australian) and phoned one of the 
            older sales staff, who was of course rather intimidated by having 
            the &quot;Chairman&quot; phone him direct and was more embarrassed by his behaviour when I pointed out that it was me he was talking to. About 
            a week later I had a call from the Chairman asking me do something 
            and of course thinking it was my work mate getting his own back at 
            me I told him I wasn't being taken in by his false accent and 
            refused to comply with his request, well it turned out that this 
            time it was the real Chairman! Luckily he had a sense of humour, but 
            I am now very careful when talking to anyone who says he is the 
            Chairman. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What hobbies do you find least interesting? </b><br>
            Cooking. I 
            can't stand cooking programmes on TV basically because I can't cook 
            and my wife is such a wonderful one. I would rather watch a rugby 
            game. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tell us about your obsession for waking up very early and 
            taking a jog on the beach. </b><br>
            I have always been an early riser and 
            will normally power-walk about 5km five times-a-week. I say 
            power-walk, as jogging is too much like hard work and I usually use 
            the time to clear my thoughts for the day. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Why choose petroleum 
            marketing as a profession? If not this, what do you think you would 
            have done? </b><br>
            I joined at the time because I had a young family, needed 
            the job and the company was international with a good reputation. 
            Generally I believe the industry as a whole is a force for change 
            and certainly sets standards in many areas of the world for HSSE and 
            ethical conduct. I have always fancied myself as a bit of a singer, 
            my only problem is that I do not have enough hair to be one and I 
            have a tendency to forget the words but if I wasn't where I am now I 
            could have been giving Elton John a run for his money! <br>
            <br>
            <b>Give us some 
            reasons why we should visit Zimbabwe, your birthplace? </b><br>
            We have our 
            home and family in Zimbabwe and I would encourage visitors to go 
            there for the scenic beauty of the eastern highlands, the tranquillity and sheer magnificence of Lake Kariba and the majestic 
            Victoria Falls. Throw in some of the best Golf courses in the world 
            together with one of the best climates and you would be hard pressed 
            to beat it. Having said all of this it is not the place to visit 
            just at the moment as the country struggles with an internal 
            conflict which impacts on all those areas I have referred to. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Are 
            you a car enthusiast, which car do you drive and how fuel-efficient 
            do you find it? </b><br>
            I regret that I have simple tastes in cars. As long they have good 
            lines, perform when required and are clean, I am happy. I drive a 
            Mercedes and it fills all of the criteria above.</font></p>

            million decline in operating profits during the first quarter of 
            2003. The good news: That was the result of the bank's conscious 
            decision to clean up its house. Vicky Kapur reports</b> <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cor-rep-oib3.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175" height="258">The year 2002 was a dream year for the &quot;people's bank&quot;, as chief 
            executive John Carlough likes to refer to Oman International Bank (OIB). 
            After all, it isn't often that a two-decade-old institution 
            experiences a breathtaking 839.27 per cent growth in profitability 
            and an 848.39 per cent jump in Earnings Per Share (EPS). <br>
            Why was it then that the Sultanate's first Omani-owned commercial 
            bank witnessed a 30 per cent decline in operating profits for the 
            first quarter of the current year - RO4.34 million in the previous 
            year to RO3.35 million this year? &quot;This is largely the result of the 
            deliberate decision by the bank to focus on its asset quality, 
            reducing the loan book by 8.4 per cent,&quot; informs Carlough. <br>
            But the result on the bank's P&amp;L Account is still negative, isn't 
            it? Disagrees Carlough: &quot;Our strategy to improve the asset quality 
            of the bank in the past few years has had a very positive impact on 
            the provision for loan impairment, which showed a substantial 
            reduction of 62.6 per cent to RO5.77 million for the year 2002 as 
            against RO15.437 million for the year 2001.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            <b>Frugal financing </b><br>
            As Carlough would have you believe, it is about fundamentals. &quot;We at 
            OIB believe in long-term gains at the cost of short-term pain, and 
            the loan-book clean-up exercise undertaken by the bank is a step in 
            that direction,&quot; he avers. Little wonder then that the bank's 2003 
            strategy entails a re-look at industry benchmarks and an intentional 
            attempt at building up the low-cost savings deposits.<br>
            A major part of that plan to buttress the savings deposits is the 
            Mandoos Scheme, which has led to a sizeable surge in the bank's 
            deposits since its launch. &quot;We have achieved an increase in our 
            marketshare since the launch of the Mandoos Scheme - from 29.45 per 
            cent in December 2002 to 31.51 per cent in May 2003. In fact, we now 
            have a special taskforce to manage the affairs of the scheme, which 
            offers the largest ever prize money in raffle draws in the 
            Sultanate,&quot; says Carlough. <br>
            The bank has recently revamped its Mandoos and Masroor schemes to 
            make them &quot;more exciting and interesting.&quot; OIB's Masroor Scheme 
            squarely targets the Sultanate's youth and, according to Carlough, 
            is in line with the bank's philosophy of focusing on future. &quot;The 
            Masroor Scheme will help us build our future base.&quot;<br>
            On the corporate side too, Carlough informs that the bank is in an 
            aggressive marketing mode, and is targeting the oil, trading and 
            manufacturing sectors to selectively grow its corporate loans 
            portfolio. &quot;All our risk-managers are now marketing staff, who 
            clearly understand the market and are in a much better position to 
            tap corporate customers and take a call on the viability of the 
            loan,&quot; he says. <br>
            Things may not be as fine on the private banking front, though. 
            While Carlough insists that the bank does have a &quot;large base,&quot; it is 
            in the process of reviewing its private banking strategy. In fact, 
            even at this moment, OIB is on a lookout for a new head to bring 
            about &quot;radical changes&quot; in the division's performance and to &quot;raise 
            the level of service delivery to a select group,&quot; he says. The 
            radical rethink that Carlough refers to entails redefining the 
            bank's private banking market segments and developing offerings to 
            fit the revised segments. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Deft development </b><br>
            The bank has set itself strategic targets for the financial year 
            2003, and among the ones at the top of the list is human resource 
            development. Apart from preparing documents for systems and 
            processes for every department in the bank, Carlough has attaining a 
            HR certification on his agenda. &quot;The bank is devoting the first half 
            of the year to customer service training by product/process experts 
            and also training to managers for service delivery management,&quot; he 
            says. &quot;The second half of the year will be dedicated to sales 
            management.&quot;<br>
            The bank, in collaboration with the Arab Academy for Banking and 
            Finance Sciences, is undertaking staff development programmes, 
            training 900 of its employees under various training schemes. The 
            training programmes, which began in the last quarter of 2002, will 
            continue till 2004, and will focus on providing service quality to 
            the customer. <br>
            Apart from employing the services of an external company for 
            receiving feedback about its services so as to rectify any problems 
            that may surface from time to time, OIB carries out extensive 
            customer service surveys at regular intervals to &quot;provide 
            competitive service to the consumer,&quot; informs Carlough. &quot;With the 
            service levels already established, an external source will now 
            monitor it, and we will also measure it for intra-departmental 
            service delivery as well,&quot; he adds. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Governance matters </b><br>
            &quot;OIB is a corporate governance prudent bank,&quot; proclaims Carlough. 
            &quot;We have a strong document on corporate governance, and we have code 
            managed it and ingrained it in the core of our bank.&quot; <br>
            OIB, he says, is always open to suggestions from the Central Bank of 
            Oman and the Capital Markets Authority, and believes in strictly 
            managing by regulations when it comes to matters related to 
            corporate governance.</font><center>

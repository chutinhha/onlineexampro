                Oman organised the 150 kilometre meal at Knowledge Oasis Muscat 
                recently. The idea behind the effort is to encourage people to 
                buy local products. Says Origin Oman’s Hamida Al Balushi, “Just 
                take a look at the labels next time you go shopping, asparagus 
                from Thailand, chicken from Brazil, milk from Saudi Arabia, 
                bananas from the Philippines, the list goes on.” Al Balushi 
                argues that food production, distribution and consumption 
                patterns have undergone a major transformation over the past 50 
                years. Just between 1968 and 2008, world food production 
                increased by over 90 per cent. Consumers can make a difference 
                by simply investigating where their food has come from and 
                buying food that has been produced locally. In fact, the Meal 
                clearly illustrated that great tasting food is being produced 
                right on our doorstep and we should be encouraging people to buy 
                it.<br>

                readers receive 50 per cent of the purchase price back if they 
                return the book after reading. “There are people here who love 
                to read, but books are very expensive says Anand. “So we 
                obviously had to communicate both those points to people. But we 
                also saw that there was the opportunity to add another layer:

                <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
                the GCC franchise market expected to grow to a value of more 
                than $81bn by 2010, with a compounded annual growth rate of 29.9 
                per cent; and the retail market forecast to continue to grow at 
                a nominal Compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 6.5 per 
                cent, franchise and retail opportunities in the region are 
                projected to have increased consumption in 2009 to 2011. As 
                franchise and retail businesses are picking up in the country 
                and are currently becoming attractive for global players, Oman 
                International Trade and Exhibitions (OITE), is all set for the 
                Franchise and Retail Expo. FRE is scheduled to be held from 
                August 4-6, 2009 alongside two other major events, namely, the 
                Lifestyle Expo and the Heavy Machinery Expo, both events are 
                organised by OITE. A report published by Alpen’s GCC Retail 
                Industry cited that the region’s growing population, rising 
                tourism and huge investments into new retail destinations will 
                encourage greater consumer spending during the forecast period.<br>

                </b><br>
                The MSM30 benchmark continued its momentum as it rose 6.18 per 
                cent for the month ended May 15 2009. This time the rally was 
                mainly led by industrial sector stocks. The recovery in MSM was 
                in tandem with the global markets, as investors showed signs of 
                higher risk appetite. Market activity improved as volume 
                increased by 44 per cent month-on- month while average turnover

                Government’s plans to carry on with development spending 
                provided the impetus to the markets. Investor confidence seemed 
                to have picked up given attractive valuation of blue chip 
                stocks. Industry index outperformed and was up 18.5 per cent for 
                the same period while service index underperformed during the 
                same period recording marginal gains. The index heavy weights 
                that lead the rally were Oman Cement (38.5 per cent) Oman Cable 
                (34.3 per cent) and Bank Sohar (25.2 per cent).<br>

                <b>GCC markets </b><br>
                Most of the GCC markets ended mixed with Qatar and Saudi markets 
                outperforming all other market for the month ended May 15, 2009. 
                Qatar and Saudi markets are perceived to be safe havens in the 
                current downturn due to accumulated reserves and government 
                development commitments. In addition, investors in both markets 
                tracked a US-led world markets rally. Qatar market was up 24 per 
                cent as the local government revealed its plans to support the 
                local financial sector. Kuwait ended mostly flat as investors 
                refrained from long calls in the market before the parliamentary 
                election. Dubai and Abu Dhabi markets had mixed news flow as 
                banks reported better outlook while real estate companies still 
                posed higher risk. <br>

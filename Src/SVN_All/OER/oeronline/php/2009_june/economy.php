                <img border="0" src="eco.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="125" height="148"></b>It’s 
                a bear market for swine flu, but Oman is nevertheless prepared 
                to deal with the threat. US traders at the Iowa Electronic 
                Health Markets, an unconventional futures market that ‘trades’ 
                everything from syphilis to avian flu based on their perceived 
                threat level, opened H1N1 futures at the end of April. Traders 
                were cautious, with most of the 300 participants banking on 
                mortality levels in the US at less than one per cent.<br>
                <br>
                The risk in the Gulf is perhaps even more remote but Oman has 
                been careful to call upon its considerable resources in case the 
                H1N1 virus sneaks into the Sultanate. Its response was prompt 
                and efficient – the Ministry of Health (MoH) immediately set up 
                a committee devoted to preventing and controlling the potential 
                spread of swine flu. But emergency preparedness aside, the 
                country’s healthcare system has some capacity issues to iron out 
                as it will soon face difficulties handling the more quotidian 
                health problems of the population.<br>
                <br>
                Indeed the healthcare industry, which is dominated by the 
                government, is of a high calibre but expansions are required. 
                Several factors are pointing to a need for greater involvement 
                of the private sector in order to address upcoming challenges. 
                For one, demand for health services is set to escalate 
                considerably as Oman’s population grows larger and, 
                unfortunately, sicker. The population is expanding at 3.2 per 
                cent a year and the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 
                such as diabetes, cancer and obesity is rising at an alarming 
                rate throughout the Gulf. The Ministry of Health estimates that 
                by the year 2020, NCDs will account for seven out of every 10 
                deaths in Oman and the World Health Organisation (WHO) recently 
                announced that it expects a 25 per cent increase over the next 
                ten years in deaths from these ailments in the Eastern 
                Mediterranean region, which includes the GCC. <br>
                <br>
                The government is hoping to stem the rise of NCDs with public 
                education programmes about healthy lifestyles, but for the 
                foreseeable future high rates of disease incidence will put an 
                increasing strain on the capacity of state facilities as more 
                Omanis seek regular physician visits. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Raising the bar </b><br>
                Besides increasing capacity, the presence of the private sector 
                also serves to boost competition and, subsequently, quality of 
                care within the sector. Public healthcare has a good reputation 
                within Oman and now private hospitals are beginning to step up 
                their capabilities. In March, for example, Muscat Private 
                Hospital, the Sultanate’s first privately owned and operated 
                hospital, successfully completed and open heart surgery – the 
                first such operation in Oman.<br>
                <br>
                Across the GCC, too, the standard of medical services and 
                technologies has been considerably raised in recent years, which 
                could help to create a culture of convivial competition and 
                innovation in the Gulf. A focus on health and education has 
                emerged as a common characteristic among the economic 
                diversification plans of GCC countries. With centres of research 
                and constantly improving medical facilities popping up around 
                the region, private investment is more likely to gravitate 
                toward the area, further accelerating its momentum toward a 
                world-class healthcare standard.<br>
                <br>
                Moreover investment in Oman and the wider GCC has also put a 
                focus on increasing medical training facilities, helping to 
                address one of the most serious problems facing the healthcare 
                sector – a shortage of skilled professionals. The Omani 
                government hopes that new training facilities within the country 
                as well as neighbouring states will help to solve the issue. 
                With demand on health services increasing all the time and a 
                lack of doctors, specialists and nurses a recurring issue 
                throughout the globe, private investment is perhaps most sorely 
                needed in medical education facilities. <br>
                <br>
                A skilled workforce is also in line with Oman’s general 
                transition to a more knowledge-based economy and a lessened 
                dependence on foreign workers, or “Omanisation” of the 
                workforce. Currently, only 29 per cent of physicians in the 
                Sultanate are Omani and in 2007 the overall level of Omanisation 
                in the healthcare sector was 68 per cent. The government’s 
                seventh five-year plan aims to raise this proportion to 81 per 
                cent by the time it expires in 2010. This is an ambitious goal 
                and increased privatisation makes financial sense in the 
                Sultanate, especially during times of tight budgetary 
                conditions. The public sector is the source of 81 per cent of 
                total health expenditure in the country and the government 
                provides healthcare to Omani nationals at a symbolic rate of RO1 
                per year. <br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="eco1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="215" height="374"><b>Enhanced budgetary spending </b><br>
                In 2009 Oman is maintaining and in fact increasing its financial 
                commitments to the health sector, despite the fact that it is 
                posting a deficit for the first time since 2001. In this year’s 
                budget the healthcare sector will receive RO271mn ($705mn), a 19 
                per cent increase over the previous year’s allocation. The 
                increase in healthcare spending outpaced that of overall 
                budgetary spending, which rose by 11 per cent year-on-year. <br>
                <br>
                Low oil and gas prices are putting stress on the budgets of 
                nearly every GCC state this year and while the Omani government 
                has not eased up on its commitment to improving the standards of 
                healthcare in the country, as evidenced by the budget, tight 
                overall financial conditions may increase officials’ eagerness 
                to privatise the sector. In short, the premature sell-off may 
                not see a worthwhile return to the government. Mohammed Hassan, 
                the undersecretary of planning at the MoH, recently told Oxford 
                Business Group, “In 10 years time we will have to spend double 
                what we spend right now and, consequently, we will have to 
                resort to alternative financing.” <br>
                <br>
                There are valid concerns that the global financial crisis will 
                shrink inward investment levels across the economy, but the 
                healthcare industry is nevertheless likely to remain attractive 
                to foreign and local private sector players. Foreign companies 
                are already eyeing the market. <br>
                <br>
                Oman registered as the fastest growing destination for inward 
                foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2008, according to a recent 
                report by fDi Intelligence, the dedicated FDI research unit of 
                Financial Times. The same report, which does not take merger and 
                acquisition activity into account, predicts that levels of real 
                investment in developing countries, including Oman, will remain 
                roughly the same as that of 2008. Moreover, the report noted 
                that healthcare is among the few sectors that are expected to 
                remain attractive to foreign investment in 2009. <br>
                <br>
                The government of Oman has already welcomed the private sector 
                into the healthcare industry, offering various incentives such 
                as soft loans and, in some cases, free land to private medical 
                entrepreneurs. Its openness has not gone unnoticed by investors, 
                with major international players like the UK-based UME Group 
                present in the Sultanate for close to a decade. As pressure on 
                the system increases and the demand fundamentals remain strong, 
                private participation in the health care sector looks set to 
                increase considerably over the coming months and years. Public 
                health providers can then begin to release a salubrious sigh of 
                relief. <br>

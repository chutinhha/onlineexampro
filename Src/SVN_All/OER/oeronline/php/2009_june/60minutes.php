            far has the global economic slowdown affected the advertising 
            industry? <br>
            </b>There has been a lot of speculation since the beginning of the 
            year about the recession in the advertising industry. Some of the 
            leading industry magazines have predicted that there will be a drop 
            of 16 per cent in global advertising this year. The Middle East ad 
            market has given evidence in the first quarter of 2009 that it will 
            not suffer at the same level.<br>
            <br>
            Omnicom, the parent company to TBWA, continuously reminds all its 
            companies around the world of the need to follow up collection of 
            receivables without giving any special favour to any client. Another 
            important measure that has been taken is to go for credit insurance. 
            In this part of the world it is an expensive proposition but we are 
            going for it. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What exactly is credit insurance and how does it works?<br>
            </b>If any client defaults in its payment then the insurance company 
            will chase him to ensure that the agency dues are collected. If the 
            client goes bankrupt, then the insurance company compensates the 
            agency as per the contract.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Is the client sharing the premium or is it solely paid by the 
            agency?</b><br>
            The agency pays for it and mind you it is a very high premium.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How has your performance been viz-a-viz other offices of TBWA?</b><br>
            Globally, in general, advertising agencies are suffering. However, 
            our MENA Network continued to show signs of increased billings 
            throughout the past five months. At TBWA Worldwide, senior 
            management reviews the performance of the different agencies at the 
            end of every quarter. In the first quarter of this year, our 
            Worldwide CFO told me he is quite happy with our performance and 
            projections. He also added that apart from China and India, they 
            have high hopes from the Middle East in 2009. <br>

            <b>
            <img border="0" src="60minutes1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="206" height="540">What 
            about the crisis in the GCC advertising market?</b><br>
            The crisis in the GCC has been blown out of the proportion. A lot of 
            people have made comments such as we are approaching doomsday and so 
            on. Such comments affected the markets in different scales. Dubai 
            suffered dramatically because of the negative media hype. The 
            negative coverage was not just restricted to the regional press but 
            it was hyped in the international media as well. But the reality is 
            quite different. The advertising market in the region started from a 
            very low base in the mid 1960s… we started gaining momentum in the 
            last eight years only and it was growing at a very high rate. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Why did the advertising market start on a low base in the Middle 
            East?</b><br>
            We all have to be blamed for that – media, advertising agencies and 
            advertisers. We didn’t have big local advertisers in the first 
            place. No market can grow without the strong support of big local 
            brands. Earlier the GCC ad market was dominated by purely global 
            brands operating in the region. Throughout the 70s and 80s, Japanese 
            brands were at the forefront. Other issues included intense 
            competition in the media, political uncertainty in the Middle East 
            region and low literacy rates. But the rise in oil prices and rapid 
            economic growth as a result of windfall revenues catapulted the 
            Middle East &amp; North Africa (MENA) region at the centre stage. In 
            2006, the top 10 fastest growing ad markets in the world included 
            five from the region – Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Kuwait. 
            As a result, top advertising networks started focusing on the 
            region. In 2008, the advertising market in the MENA region went up 
            by 22 per cent over the previous year. The UAE grew by 40 per cent, 
            it was phenomenal.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How have the sentiments been in 2009?</b><br>
            At the beginning, the advertising market was beset with worries but 
            people have realised that there is no need to panic as the ME region 
            is a growing market at a time when most of the other markets are in 
            recession. The oil prices are moving up again.<br>
            <br>
            <b>But what about sectors such as real estate which have been major 
            contributors to the advertising market and have now taken a beating?</b><br>
            The real estate sector contributed just 18 per cent of the entire ME 
            advertising in 2008. Even if we presume that real estate’s 
            contribution will be zero this year, the market which grew by 22 per 
            cent in 2008 will not suffer from negative growth with the battering 
            of one sector. There has been a drop in many markets in the first 
            quarter of this year. Unfortunately Dubai, which has suffered a 
            major drop, is seen as the reflection of the health of the entire ME 
            market, but that is not true. Many media companies and advertisers 
            are based in Dubai but their products are mostly consumed in other 
            parts of the region. Saudi Arabia is a very large market in the 
            region. In Q1 this year, many markets have witnessed dramatic 
            growths on year-on-year basis – Qatar (28 per cent), Kuwait (26 per 
            cent) and Oman (12 per cent). The negative growth is in markets 
            including UAE (-17 per cent), Bahrain (-14 per cent), and Egypt (-8 
            per cent). <br>
            <br>
            Generally, the first two quarters of the year are not as robust as 
            purchasing in the market goes up in the third and fourth quarters 
            due to the festive season on account of Ramadan, Christmas, and the 
            back-to-school season. This year it will be tough as Ramadan period 
            is coming right after the summer holidays.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How do you look at the Oman market and your relationship with the 
            ZEENAH Group?</b><br>
            Oman's advertising and wider communications market is very 
            promising. If we go back to 2003, the market was pegged at $54mn. In 
            2008, it had grown substantially to $131mn. We tied-up with ZEENAH 
            in 2007 and the agency became TBWA\ZEENAH. The agency has the same 
            passion and the ethos which are the hallmarks of TBWA. ZEENAH has 
            grown by leaps and bounds due to their investment in building a 
            world class servicing structure which is unique in the Sultanate and 
            most recently, has broadened to cover not only advertising, but 
            specialist companies for events, public relations and media as well. 
            They also went aggressively after local new business. In the coming 
            years, we would like to support ZEENAH with business coming from 
            TBWA global clients also. <br>
            <br>
            <b>TBWA Worldwide is known for its ‘Disruption’ strategy. How is it 
            relevant for the Omani market?</b><br>
            Disruption is in the DNA of the agency. Disruption is about finding 
            the strategic idea that breaks and overturns convention in the 
            marketplace, and then makes it possible to reach a new vision and 
            secure a larger share of the future for the client. Wherever we are 
            present, we challenge the myth that local markets are not mature 
            enough. Wherever we go we share the results of how disruption has 
            worked for our clients in other markets. Disruption is as relevant 
            for Oman as any other market in the world. <br>
            <br>
            <b>A strong marketing communication based on disruptive strategy 
            devised by the agency may not always be accompanied by a change in 
            the brand experience for the customers. Why does it happen?</b><br>
            The change cannot happen overnight. The transition takes place over 
            a period of time. Disruption has to be embraced by the company, 
            incorporated in its processes and adopted by the mindsets involved 
            to make it optimally effective in its application. Our success with 
            clients including Mars, Etihad, Visa and Jumeirah as well as many 
            other global and regional brands is a testimony of our agency’s 
            strong credentials. <br>
            <br>
            <b>You now have over four decades in the industry, what’s next for 
            you?</b><br>
            In Oman, we want to strengthen our relationship with ZEENAH. We want 
            the TBWA\RAAD MENA Network to become the international agency of the 
            year, the first one from the Middle East region, in 2012.

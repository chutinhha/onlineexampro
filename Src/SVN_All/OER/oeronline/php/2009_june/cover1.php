            Renewable Energy – On a roll</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            <b>The development of renewable energy is an ongoing process and 
            although it may
            not be viable today, it may soon become relevant for Oman due to 
            newer technologies,
            writes Visvas Paul D Karra</b><br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover22.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="195" height="270">There are two reasons why the quest for renewable and alternative 
            energy has taken on a new tone of urgency. Firstly, the era of easy 
            oil is over and the cost of extracting the remaining fossil fuel 
            will not be able to match the demand for energy, which is expected 
            to double by 2050. The second reason is of course the almost 
            ubiquitous word “green’. Although it has become a fashionable 
            statement to talk green, the green umbrella will not be able to 
            withstand the weight of the actual CO2 emissions, which have reached 
            alarming levels. And the only way to reduce the emissions is by 
            alternative energy. And that is how, everyone is in a frenzy to join 
            the chase for renewable or alternative energy. It has been estimated 
            that the amount of sunlight reaching the earth every 70 minutes is 
            equivalent to annual global energy consumption. Also less than four 
            per cent of the desert area of North Africa and the MENA region 
            could generate enough electricity to meet the annual global 
            electricity demand and less than one per cent of this desert area 
            could meet the electricity requirements of the Gulf region and 
            Europe. “In May 2008 the Authority for Electricity Regulation (AER) 
            published a study commissioned to assess the Sultanate’s renewable 
            energy potential. The study confirmed the Sultanate’s significant 
            solar and wind potential. Qais Saud Al Zakwani, regulatory advisor 
            at the AER disclosed that towards the end of 2008, the Authority 
            invited the Rural Areas Electricity Company (RAEC) to identify 
            possible locations for diesel system hybrid pilot projects, and make 
            information available for potential developers. Several 
            international and local companies expressed interest in developing 
            pilot projects within the preliminary framework developed by the 
            Authority and after initial coordination with RAEC submitted 
            renewable energy pilot project proposals to the Authority for 
            approval. There are around 54 rural sites which are not connected to 
            the main power grid which at present are being run on diesel power 
            to generate electricity by RAEC.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover23.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="193" height="268">The level of solar energy density in Oman is among the highest in 
            the world. There is significant scope for developing solar energy 
            resources throughout Oman and solar energy has the potential to 
            provide sufficient electricity to meet all of Oman’s domestic 
            electricity requirements and provide some electricity for export. 
            High solar energy density is available in all regions of Oman. The 
            study also identified significant wind energy potential in coastal 
            areas in the southern part of Oman and in the mountains north of 
            Salalah. Wind speeds in these areas are comparable to recorded wind 
            speeds at inland sites in Europe where large numbers of wind 
            turbines are installed and operational. Wind speeds are observed to 
            be highest in summer months which coincide with peak periods of 
            electricity demand in Oman.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Pilot project</b><br>
            According to HE Mohammed bin Nasser Al Khasaibi, Secretary General 
            of Ministry of National Economy, pilot projects have been 
            recommended in rural areas to test the performance and efficiency of 
            renewable technologies in local conditions and provide Omani 
            companies with experience of operating and maintaining renewable 
            plants. To further progress the renewable initiative, the Authority 
            appointed international consultancy firm COWI to assist with reviews 
            and approval of renewable energy pilot projects. The Authority is 
            currently reviewing seven proposals to generate wind and solar 
            power.<br>
            <br>
            On a macroeconomic scale, the Public Authority for Electricity and 
            Water (PAEW) is in the process of recruiting international advisors 
            to conduct a feasibility study for a large solar plant in Oman. HE 
            Khasaibi is confident that a large solar plant will be found to be 
            feasible. Once it is confirmed, then PAEW will permit the setting 
            Oman’s first large scale solar power plant by 2010.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Alternative energy</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="cover24.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="202" height="224">The government of Oman has to take concrete steps to promote 
            alternative/renewable sources of energy and only then will companies 
            come forward to set up projects here, says K S Cheema, executive 
            director, legal and projects, Omzest Group. “The government should 
            appreciate that conventional energy is cheap in Oman because oil and 
            gas is subsidised. But I am happy that the government has undertaken 
            a study on renewable sources of energy and has also invited interest 
            to undertake feasibility study for such projects and for setting up 
            small pilot plants for electricity generation based on solar and 
            wind energy resources,” adds Cheema. Omzest group has recently 
            invested in an international company, which has developed a 
            technology to convert solid wastes into synthesis gas and in turn 
            into electricity. In the Muscat area, around 400,000 tonnes of solid 
            waste is generated every year. This is dumped into designated 
            landfills near the capital area of Muscat. This waste could be 
            segregated and used to produce energy with the help the technology 
            developed by the company, in which Omzest group has recently 
            invested. “If the government gives us the go ahead we can use this 
            waste to produce energy. This way the government would be able to 
            get rid of the environmentally hazardous landfills and at the same 
            time generate power using this alternative source. The government 
            has to decide upon an appropriate tariff for buying power from such 
            projects, which will make these projects feasible for a private 
            investor like us. They should not compare it to the cost of power 
            generated by conventional plants using natural gas in Oman, which is 
            highly subsidised,” Cheema opines.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover25.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="194" height="267"><b>Clear policies</b><br>
            According to Cheema if the government pursues alternative/renewable 
            sources of energy to produce power, they could reserve and divert 
            the precious natural gas for other industrial projects, which are 
            presently not coming to Oman because of non-availability of natural 
            gas for new projects. This way, the country would be able to invite 
            foreign investments not only in the renewable energy sector but also 
            in the industrial sector as well. “By developing policies, which can 
            support and sustain projects based on alternative and renewable 
            sources of energy across the country, we will all be contributing to 
            the vision of His Majesty The Sultan and will help in the economic 
            expansion of Oman,” Cheema says. <br>
            <br>
            Zakwani also added that the Renewable Energy Study recommended the 
            development of policies and funding mechanisms and encourage 
            renewable energy investments in Oman which will generate interest 
            among international companies to come to Oman. According to Zakwani, 
            there are several instruments that need to be put in place as a 
            matter of government policy which will facilitate the implementation 
            on renewable projects. The study published by AER suggested tax 
            credits and investment subsidies; feed in tariffs for both small and 
            medium sized projects; renewable energy quotas requiring a certain 
            percentage of total system capacity to be sourced from renewable 
            energy sources; and the establishment of a designated national 
            authority (DNA) to facilitate and administer clean development 
            mechanism projects.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Multiple benefits</b><br>
            A successful renewable energy strategy offers the prospect of wider 
            environmental and social benefits. Renewable energy used to produce 
            electricity emits zero green house gases (GHG). Using renewable 
            energy technologies in place of conventional fossil fuel plant would 
            therefore reduce GHG emissions in the Sultanate including CO2s. The 
            reduction in GHG emissions (carbon would be approximately 175 kg/MWh 
            where renewable energy replaces natural gas and 212 kg/MWh when 
            diesel fuel is replaced. Total savings in GHG emissions will depend 
            upon the contribution of renewable energy technologies to total 
            electricity supply.<br>
            <br>
            If the renewable energy industry takes off in a big way in Oman, it 
            could stimulate and promote Oman-based manufacturing of renewable 
            energy products for domestic use and export and at the same time 
            promote renewable energy support services. A successful renewable 
            energy strategy would enhance employment opportunities for Omani 
            nationals in manufacturing and support services and nurture 
            expertise in new technologies and more economic activities.<br>

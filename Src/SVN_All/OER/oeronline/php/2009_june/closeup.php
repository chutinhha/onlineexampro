                is implementing a slew of socio-economic and socio-political 
                changes to combat the economic crisis and to get a modern image. 
                The government has introduced fresh initiatives designed to 
                boost confidence in the country’s economy in general and the 
                financial system in particular. The other evidence relates to 
                ballot voting of four females to the national assembly for the 
                first time in 12 parliamentary elections. In April, the 
                authorities implemented a $14bn dollar financial stability law 
                designed to restore confidence in the country’s financial 
                sector. The plan requires the government to guarantee 50 per 
                cent of loans extended by local banks in 2009 and 2010. In 
                addition, the scheme calls on the state to provide guarantees 
                for 15 years against any drop in investment and real estate 
                portfolios besides old loans extended to local firms. Total 
                outstanding debt burden on some 99 local investment firms is 
                estimated at $18bn including $7.6bn owed to foreign financial 
                institutions. Yet, the new scheme provides local companies the 
                opportunity to use fresh credit to repay debt commitments to 
                local and foreign banks. <br>
                <br>
                <b>No giveaways</b><br>
                Indeed, the amount is sizable by virtue of comprising about 10 
                per cent of state revenue in the last fiscal year and nearly 
                five per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). 
                Yet, the scheme is not a giveaway, with prospective companies 
                required to make financial and administrative changes including 
                enhancing their capital base. In other words, only serious 
                companies willing to undergo change in the way they run their 
                business need to apply. <br>
                <br>
                The government’s seriousness about the initiative can be traced 
                to Kuwait investment authority’s (Kia) commitment to buy the 
                remaining shares of overhauled companies in case existing 
                shareholders fail to fully subscribe to increases of capital 
                resources. Kia serves as the country’s investment arm or the 
                sovereign wealth fund (SWF). By one account, Kia controls some 
                $250bn, in turn the third largest SWF within the gulf 
                cooperation council (GCC) states after the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

                initiatives</b><br>
                The financial stability law is only the third such initiative 
                undertaken by Kuwaiti authorities in dealing with the 
                consequences of the on-going financial crisis. In 2008, 
                financial officials decided to guarantee all deposits in the 
                banking system after gulf bank, the second largest lender in the 
                country, reported a loss of $1bn from its derivatives activity. 
                In another move, the government called on state institutions led 
                by the Kia to buy shares of firms listed on the Kuwait stock 
                exchange (KSE), as a part of its efforts to restore confidence 
                in the economy. The fund is long-term in nature with investments 
                remaining at the bourse for five years. <br>
                <br>
                To be sure, Kuwait has a history of having undertaken 
                exceptional steps in addressing financial challenges. In 1982, 
                the government accepted responsibility for $20bn of difficult 
                loans in the aftermath of the crash of an unofficial bourse. And 
                following the country’s liberation after Iraq's invasion in 
                1991, the authorities wrote off all consumer loans taken by 
                Kuwaiti nationals. <br>
                <br>
                <b>A friendlier parliament </b><br>
                Much to the delight of authorities, the election results of the 
                parliamentary contest held on may 16, 2009 suggests that the new 
                national assembly would most likely endorse the financial 
                stability law. The authorities opted for the scheme weeks after 
                the country’s ruler dissolved the 11th national assembly in 
                march. The government adopted the package under what is known as 
                the necessity law. Yet, the national assembly has the power to 
                approve, reject or amend laws introduced during absence of the 
                national assembly. Visiting Kuwait during election times, i 
                learned that the business community paid close attention to 
                elections issues and positions of candidates on challenges 
                facing the economy. The interest partly reflects the fact that 
                the newly elected assembly would decide the fate of a 
                multi-billion dollar package designed to restore confidence in 
                Kuwait's financial system in the aftermath of the global 
                financial crisis. <br>
                <br>
                in addition, business leaders would like to see legislators 
                speeding up the privatisation programme. The programme includes 
                selling off shares in banks, insurance companies and light 
                industries that the government had purchased through kia after 
                the collapse of the stock market in 1982 and the Iraqi invasion 
                in 1990. <br>
                <br>
                Plus the authorities desire to privatise certain activities of 
                Kuwait petroleum corporation and the buses operated by the 
                Kuwait public transport company. Other areas that are likely to 
                be privatised include postal services and ground communication 
                stations as well as x-ray laboratories and security at public 
                hospitals. Earlier, the authorities succeeded in privatising 
                petrol stations. The privatisation drive should help broaden the 
                sources of revenue and reduce the country’s reliance on oil. The 
                petroleum sector accounts for 90 per cent of total treasury 
                income, making Kuwait the most oil dependent nation oil amongst 
                fellow GCC countries. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Fuelling the economy </b><br>
                One positive aspect of Kuwait's parliamentary elections relates 
                to the financial contribution to the local economy. By one 
                account, total expenses incurred on the elections in 2009 
                amounted to $200mn in a span of two months. The figure increases 
                further via the notion of a multiplier effect, as every dollar 
                spent generates an additional three dollars in the form of 
                spending on food, tents, compensation for staff and media 
                sources.<br>
                <br>
                To be sure, the latest parliamentary election only strengthened 
                a trend started during elections in 2008 which involved the 
                elaborate use of television appearances while discussing 
                solutions to problems facing the nation. Some candidates joined 
                forces in setting up special television channels dedicated to 
                broadcasting messages to their constituents. <br>
                <br>
                Undoubtedly, additional spending into the economy could not be 
                more timely, as the country tries to cope with the adverse 
                effects of the on-going global financial crisis. Amongst other 
                negative developments, the financial crisis undermined 
                confidence in the economy, exemplified by the reluctance of 
                banks to grant credit facilities due to anxieties about 
                borrower’s ability to repay. Clearly, Kuwait stands out within 
                GCC states for its willingness to experiment with bold 
                initiatives to overcoming major financial problems like the 
                contemporary credit crunch. These moves, notably the financial 
                stability law should serve the goal of not allowing the 
                financial crisis turning into an economic one. The election of 
                four females as mps, only adds value to Kuwait's image. <br>

            holding different jobs across in sectors like education and telecom, 
            Mohammed Al Hassani seems to have finally found his calling. Having 
            a passion for communication the role of a corporate interpersonal 
            relations manager comes naturally to him. He strongly believes that 
            communication between the bank and its customers should be 
            strengthened to meet satisfactory service standards. As 
            communicating is the key factor that brings two people together, it 
            is effective in bringing people together irrespective of the 
            industry. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Work ethic </b><br>
            Talking about the work pressures that he faces Mohammed states that 
            if one knows ones job then there’s nothing called pressure. “A 
            person should know what his work requires only then can he get 
            better in his field,” he says. Having a background in marketing, he 
            loves his job and is very much involved in every segment of it. He 
            revels in the euphoria that a campaign from the bank generates. Says 
            Mohammed, “It is extremely satisfying to see a product or brand 
            succeed in the market.” He believes that branding also plays an 
            integral part in communication. When it comes to food he prefers 
            traditional Omani cuisine to any other cuisine. In exotic cuisine, 
            spicy Indian food remains an abiding favourite. Not someone who 
            relishes long distance travel, he visits the interiors of Oman and 
            the adjoining places during holidays. But being a senior executive 
            Mohammed does travel frequently to various regional countries on 
            work. <br>
            <br>
            <b>True to his roots</b><br>
            <b>
            <img border="0" src="board1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="191" height="215"></b>Coming from a traditional Omani background, Mohammed likes visiting 
            his close friends and family whenever possible. “Interpersonal 
            relations is an integral part of our culture and I like maintaining 
            ties with my friends and acquaintances,” he avers. A family man he 
            spends a lot of quality time with his family. This he believes would 
            help him in shaping the future of his children. “I would rather 
            invest (time) in my children rather than investing in shares and 
            bonds.” Striking a work-life balance is one of his highest 
            priorities. Says Mohammed, “Checking advertisements in magazines and 
            television is my favourite hobby. When most people watch movies, 
            they like to switch channels when there is an advertisement break. 
            Instead I like to switch channels to see the different 
            advertisements between movie breaks,” he adds, “An advertisement is 
            about creativity. And when I see creativity, I like to read between 
            the lines and to try and understand the message that they are trying 
            to convey. This really interests me. I like the advertisements from 
            Saudi television channels and news channels like BBC and CNN.” With 
            such an abiding passion for his job, it is no surprise that Mohammed 
            has reached such heights in his career. <br>

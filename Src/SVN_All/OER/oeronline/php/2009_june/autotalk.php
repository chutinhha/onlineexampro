                very best models that Rolls-Royce had to offer. But rather than 
                review the car we decided to take a look at its roots and find

                story begins with a certain someone called Henry Royce. It was 
                in 1904 that Henry Rolls made his first car, a two cylinder 
                vehicle called Royce 10, in his Manchester factory. Then on 4th 
                May of the same year he was introduced to Charles Rolls at the 
                Midlands Hotel. Rolls, at the time the proprietor of an early 
                motor car dealership C.S.Rolls &amp; Co. in Fulham, took a certain 
                liking to the Royce 10. Soon thereafter, on the 23rd of December 
                the same year, an agreement was signed whereby Rolls would take 
                all the cars that Royce could make and have them sold 
                exclusively by him. There were four cars initially, the first of 
                which debuted at the Paris Salon also in December 1904, and it 
                was agreed that they would all be badged Rolls-Royce. But it was 
                not until 15th March 1906 that Rolls-Royce Limited was formed 
                and the factory was shifted to its new premises in Derby and 
                started production in early 1908. In the meantime Royce had been 
                developing an improved model with more power. Initially 
                designated the 40/50hp, this was the company’s first all-new 
                model. In March 1908 it was decided that Rolls-Royce would 
                concentrate all its efforts on this model and successively all 
                the previous models were discontinued. The car was later called 
                the Silver Ghost and was solely responsible for the company’s 
                initial reputation. Over 7,700 models of the Silver Ghost were 
                built and a second factory has to be opened in the United States 
                to meet the demand (The US versions were called the ‘Springfield 
                Ghosts’). In 1925 Rolls-Royce replaced the Silver Ghost with 
                what was to be its most iconic model – The Phantom. <br>

                <img border="0" src="autotalk1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="207">After 
                the war, in 1931, Rolls-Royce acquired its rival brand Bentley 
                and from then onwards until 2002 the two companies had mostly 
                identical cars. In 1946 the company moved production to Crewe 
                and then to Mulliner Park Ward in London in 1959. It was here 
                that Rolls-Royce started to first build bodies for its cars, 
                which were earlier built by specialist coach builders. In 1965 
                Rolls-Royce introduced another of its hallmark cars – the Silver 
                Shadow. It was the first Rolls-Royce with a monocoque chassis 
                and was equipped with a 6.23 L V8 engine which was later 
                expanded to 6.75 L. In 1973 the Rolls-Royce automobile division 
                was demerged from Rolls-Royce Limited and was named Rolls-Royce 
                motors. Later, in 1980, Rolls-Royce Motors was acquired by 
                Vickers but it was not long before it was put on sale again, in 
                1998, and this is where things got really complicated. At the 
                time the leading contender seemed to be BMW, who already 
                supplied engines and other components for Rolls-Royce and 
                Bentley cars. But their final offer of £340mn was outbid by 
                Volkswagen, who offered £430mn. However, VW had bought rights to 
                the “Spirit of Ecstasy” mascot and the shape of the radiator 
                grille, but it lacked rights to the Rolls-Royce name in order to 
                build the cars. Likewise, BMW lacked rights to the grille and 
                mascot. BMW then bought an option on the trademarks, arguably 
                the most valuable property of the deal, and licensed the name 
                and “RR” logo for £40mn. Finally BMW and VW arrived at a 
                solution. From 1998 to 2002 BMW would continue to supply engines 
                for the cars and would allow use of the names. But effective 1st 
                January 2003, only BMW would have the right to name cars 
                “Rolls-Royce”, and VW’s would only be able to build Bentleys. 
                The last Rolls-Royce to ever roll out of the Crew factory was a 
                Corniche in 2002.<br>

                <b>Modern legends</b><br>
                It was only once BMW took over that we saw the three works of 
                art that are the Phantom, the Coupe and the Drophead. Despite 
                being built by BMW it seems that none of the core essences’ of 
                the Rolls-Royce brand were lost. Their powerful, upright stance 
                and dynamic, rising profile and also the unique rear coach doors 
                on the phantom and front coach doors on the Coupe and the 
                Drophead are unmistakably Rolls-Royce. The interior of each is 
                clean and contemporary, the simplicity of the design belying the 
                technology beneath. Any controls not needed for everyday driving 
                are kept out of sight until required. Drive either of them and 
                the ease and effortlessness of the controls is breathtaking. 
                They are lightning fast but never ever do they feel rushed, they 
                just pick up speed with such grace that you will never find in 
                another vehicle. In essence they feel just like a Rolls-Royce 
                should. </font></p>

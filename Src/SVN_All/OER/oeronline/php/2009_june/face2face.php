            and Oman share centuries old social and economic relations? How have 
            these relations been strengthened during recent times?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            Oman and India have distinguished historical, cultural and 
            commercial relations, which have deep roots since a long time. These 
            relations are continuously growing over time and can be traced in 
            the growth of bilateral trade relations in recent years through the 
            genuine interest of both countries to create regulated economic and 
            commercial frameworks to improve, reinforce and foster cooperation 
            between the two countries.<br>
            <br>
            Through the meetings being held between the joint commission of the 
            two countries various areas of cooperation have been dealt with, and 
            many bilateral agreements have been signed between the two countries 
            covering investment, taxation, and technical assistance. India is 
            also a major trade partner for Oman. To boost trade relations, GCC 
            states have started negotiations with India for concluding a Free 
            Trade Agreement (FTA) for the best interest of GCC countries and 
            India. Both countries are exerting more efforts to strengthen their 
            bilateral relations in various fields, such as trade, industry and 
            commercial services.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>What are the areas in which India can contribute to 
            the development of the Sultanate of Oman?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            The governments of the two countries are doing their best to enter 
            into joint ventures. Many projects have been established, such as 
            the Oman-Indian fertilizer project, and others. Recent developments 
            in the bilateral relations signify noticeable cooperation. For 
            example, Oman and India are in the final stages of setting up a fund 
            to be utilised for the development of infrastructure projects in 
            both countries. Oman and India have signed two memorandums of 
            understanding (MQU’s), one is concerned with bilateral investment, 
            and the other is to boost manpower cooperation. These agreements and 
            memorandums will encourage the private sectors in both countries to 
            cooperate in promoting education, vocational training, as well as 
            mutual cooperation in information technology (IT), health services, 
            and telecommunication.<br>

            <img border="0" src="face1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="275">How 
            can the two countries work together in promoting enhanced stability 
            and security in the region?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            Oman and India are members in United Nations, as well as other 
            regional organisations concerned with socio-economic development, 
            promoting collective efforts to maintain peace, stability, and 
            security worldwide. So, Oman and India have special concerns as 
            regards promoting and preserving stability, and they are doing their 
            best to safeguard security in the region.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>The Sultanate has pursued a path of consistent 
            economic growth? What has been the guiding philosophy behind this 
            model of development?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            Since 1970 Oman adopted a free market economy, based on a planned 
            approach combining both the economic and social aspects, and 
            focusing on regional and sectoral development. The successive plans 
            have adopted objectives, policies and mechanisms aiming at achieving 
            growth, to transform the economy from a traditional one to a modern 
            developed economy. The fundamental goals of the Omani economy, being 
            the guidelines for all the development plans, necessitated a change 
            in the government's role, shifting it from economic dominance to 
            strategic guidance of an economy depending on stable balanced macro 
            economic framework, a dynamic competitive private sector, skilled 
            manpower, diversified productive base, and a high standard of living 
            for the Omani citizens. So, the Sultanate is adopting an economic 
            philosophy based on an indicative scientific planning approach 
            leading for comprehensive development at both economic and social 
            spheres.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>Has the economic model of consistent yet steady 
            progress enabled Oman to negotiate the international financial 
            crisis in a better way?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            Oman is safely overcoming the repercussions of the recent global 
            financial and economic crisis, because of its sound financial 
            position. This was possible due to the prudent fiscal and monetary 
            policies being adopted, especially during the recent period of 
            prosperity and strong economic growth. Part of oil revenue surpluses 
            have been diverted to strengthen the reserves, and reduce public 
            debt. This has also helped Oman to continue with the expansionary 
            fiscal policy to stimulate growth and increase public spending. The 
            Omani economy had a strong performance in 2008, as the gross 
            domestic product (GDP) grew by 13 per cent at fixed prices, and 44 
            per cent at current prices, compared with 2007. The growth of 
            liquidity and credit rates remained highly positive in the latter 
            half of 2008, and the first quarter of 2009. Local demand 
            indicators, net imports, and size of manpower in the private sector 
            did not show any indications of recession. So, it can be said that 
            the Omani economy has not been affected significantly by the 
            financial markets. The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) attributes the 
            immunity of Omani banks to their zero exposure to the toxic 
            financial assets on one hand, and to CBO’s sound regulations on the 
            other hand. Oman has always been prudent with its revenues and oil 
            revenues for this year are based on an assumption of $45 per barrel. 
            So, this year the budget is conservative, forecasting a deficit 
            amounting to RO810mm, equivalent to five per cent of GDP. The 
            economy is expected to register a one per cent growth in government 
            expenditure, so as to, maintain sustained socio- economic 
            development.

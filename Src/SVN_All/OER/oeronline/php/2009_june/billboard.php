                  Intervention for Children with Special Needs with RO 250,000 
                  over three years. Renaissance reported the arrangement last 
                  year as a fund toward a diploma programme in special education 
                  for 45 Omani teachers. The outcome will enable the graduates 
                  to acquire specialist skills that assist the empowerment of 
                  the young children to live active roles in society. The 
                  Association aims to create a model resource centre and 
                  training programmes that serves disabled children with a 
                  comprehensive early intervention that covers social, medical, 
                  physical, occupational therapies and academic services. 
                  Renaissance CEO Stephen Thomas said, “While we do not normally 
                  publicise specific donations made as part of the corporate 
                  social responsibility programme at Renaissance, beyond the 
                  disclosure requirements as a public company listed on the 
                  Muscat Securities Market, on this occasion we would like to 
                  urge others to support the outstanding work of the Association 
                  in whatever way they can. We can all learn from these 
                  wonderful children who take on their challenges with positive 
                  thinking and possess qualities of friendship and unconditional 
                  love from which we might all learn. It is clear that these 
                  young children can make an outstanding contribution to society 
                  as they progress through life.”<br>

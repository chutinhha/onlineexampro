Toyota’s newest thoroughbred Aurion packs in class, performance and stability.

<font face="Verdana" size="1">The event seemed just like out of the pages of a 
world auto rally event. Right from the roaring engines to the speeding steel and 
the screeching tyres. The Raikonnens, Schumachers and Alonsos were out to set a 
record of their own. Or rather, the wannabe Raikonnens, Schumachers and Alonsos. 
Now, this was not an international rally, as much as we would have it liked it 
to be. But nevertheless it was an event that had its share of adrenaline pumping 
and excitement. It was the launch of the latest automobile from the House of 
Toyota – the Aurion. Organised at the Dubai Autodrome the daylong event had 
journalists from the GCC testing the car as well as their driving skills. The 
event kicked off with a press conference where the journalists were given all 
the info they needed about the newest addition to the Toyota family. Targeted at 
young urban professionals, the Aurion is strategically positioned between the 
Avalon and the Camry.<br>
<br>
Right after the unveiling of the Aurion, we were taken to the tracks to 
test-drive the spanking new sedan in true rally mode. Three journalists each 
were taken at a time to the track to test out the Aurion. Our directions were 
clear: stay within appropriate speed levels (unless allowed by the instructor in 
the car), stay in the lane and do not try daredevil tactics.<br>
<b><br>
Smart Looks</b><br>
Smart, clean and contemporary. These were the adjectives that came to mind when 
the Aurion was unveiled at the press conference. The sedan definitely had the 
markings of a car that youngsters and urban professionals would like. Right from 
the sharp, sporty nose design to the distinctly positioned halogen headlamps 
(HID headlamps in the Grande) or the slightly pushed out tires, the Aurion sure 
did make an impression at first sight. Toyota has maintained a clean body 
styling for the Aurion, a feature that is maintained with most of their 
vehicles.<br>
<br>
The no-fuss, clean exterior characteristic has been taken to the interiors of 
the Aurion too, though it’s as stylish as sedans in that category come. 
Simplicity is the keyword of Toyota’s interior design with aesthetically placed 
control knobs and panel. But it’s tough not to notice the plush feel the Aurion 
exudes with the one-touch storage hoods, wood panelling and leather trims. The 
instrument panel features Optitron metres adding to the classy ambience inside 
the sedan. The Aurion also has a multi-display screen on the centre console, 
which definitely is a neat bonus.<br>
<br>
Toyota seems to understand passengers’ need for space. They demonstrated it in 
the new Camry by lowering the floor tunnel considerably at the back and now 
again in the Aurion they have incorporated the same design tactics. A feature 
that surely is not going to go unnoticed!<br>
Driving Impressions Each of us at the launch was allowed three laps on the 
course to test the Aurion’s motoring capabilities. Fitted in with a V6 3.5 litre 
engine the Aurion definitely wouldn’t disappoint. And it didn’t. The Aurion 
impressed with its excellent pick up on the track and effortless acceleration. 
The reason behind the Aurion’s impressive performance is its new V6 3.5 litre 
engine and a lightweight 6-speed sequential automatic transaxle (which 
incidentally is a first for Toyota vehicles with front engine, front drive 
capability).<br>
<br>
Since there were only three cars at a time on the track and considerable time 
gap between each car’s take-off, we were allowed the liberty of going over 120 
kmph (provided we didn’t get too excited and try to pull some feat).<br>
<br>
The Aurion’s road handling capabilities were remarkable with the sedan rarely 
skidding or going out of control even at the sharpest turns on the course. A 
MacPherson strut has been used for the front suspernsion and a dual-link strut 
for the rear. Steering the car was almost effortless (the officials were right 
when they talked about the effortless steering abilities of the Aurion) and 
instilled a strong sense of confidence within moments of getting behind the 
wheel. The Aurion was undoubtedly among those sedans that make you feel in 
control even at high speeds and in terrible traffic.<br>
<br>
You must be wondering how well the brake system performed at the speeds we were 
driving at and the curves we had to take. Remarkably well, indeed! Jamming the 
brakes at 100 kmph brought the car to a standstill and that too with hardly any 
veering off the track. Now that’s how a good brake system should be. Toyota 
vehicles are known for their high level safety systems and this was a classic 
example for us.<br>
<br>
The Aurion proved to be a good performer even at the second racetrack that was 
strewn with obstacles through which we had to drive and make it to the starting 
point in the shortest possible time. Leaving aside the fact that the journalists 
had a great time trying to outdo each other’s record, the Aurion demonstrated 
once again its impressive performance on the track at different speeds, 
manoeuvrability and stability. The 17-inch low-profile tires ensured that the 
driver got maximum driving comfort and good road surface adherence.<br>
<br>
We left the Autodrome with a sense of elation at having done well on the track 
(so what if we <br>
didn’t win any of the three trophies up for grabs) and having a go at the rally 
circuit, albeit a minor one. But in the end it was Toyota that emerged as the 
winner with the auto giant scoring yet another milestone with the Aurion.<br>

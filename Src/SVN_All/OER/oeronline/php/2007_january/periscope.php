<b>Asian Shares Move Cautiously Forward</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>The emerging markets, particularly Asian stock exchanges, will be 
increasingly decoupled from the US consumer and liquidity cycle</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="prisc.jpg" width="120" height="174" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">Asian 
shares were winners in 2006 despite higher oil prices, a depreciating dollar and 
the economic slowdown in the US. Sure, the Bank of Japan was the liquidity pump 
in the global financial markets and the end of Japanese deflation could mean 
higher call rates in the money markets in Tokyo. Valuations have risen across 
Asia, with a 34 multiple China and 25 multiple for India making an emerging 
Chindia bubble. Today, Asia is the epicentre of global economic growth. Earnings 
growth in Asia will increasingly be derived from consumption, the wealth effect 
from higher property prices and the sheer fund-raising scale of Asian private 
equity funds. The emerging markets, particularly Asian stock exchanges, will be 
increasingly decoupled from the US consumer and liquidity cycle.<br>
<br>
At 16,900, the Nikkei does not have huge upside. However, I believe the Japanese 
yen is a steal at 120-117 and will rise as high as 105 against the dollar. This 
will hurt GDP growth and exports even as the Bank of Japan’s tight monetary 
policy crimps the housing and consumer economy. Besides, the Empire in the 
Rising Sun trades at 17 times earnings in 2007, an unjustified valuation premium 
to Wall Street (15x) and Europe (14x) for lower returns on equity and earnings 
growth. I believe total return in Japanese shares next year will be 10 per cent.<br>
<b><br>
Pakistan performs</b><br>
Pakistan has been one of the best performing stock markets since 2001, when Gen 
Musharraf made a foreign policy u-turn, abandoning the Taliban and allying with 
the US war on terror. This resulted in America writing off huge swathes of 
Pakistan’s $38 billion sovereign debt to the Paris Club, IMF and the Asian 
Development Bank.<br>
<br>
Pakistan’s net interest burden shrank, remittances soared, a new government 
headed by ex-Citibanker Shaukat Aziz implemented structural reform, inflation 
plunged, central bank reserves soared from $1 billion to $13 billion. And, the 
Pakistani rupee, which had been a classic South Asian devaluation currency, 
soared in value to 57 against the US dollar, enabling Pakistan to borrow once 
again in the Eurobond market. However, Pakistan’s trade deficit, inflation and 
political instability are its Achilles heels. The Karachi stock market, which 
went on one of the longest secular bull runs in the emerging markets, from 1,800 
to 11,000, is now overvalued as the State Bank tightens monetary policy, trade 
deficit balloons, inflation surges and the IMF warns of a devaluation of the 
Pakistani rupee. Pakistan is an unambiguous underweight for 2007.<br>
<br>
Indian shares are trading at all times highs at 24 times earnings. The Sensex at 
13,600 is priced to perfection at 5 times price to book value, even if corporate 
earnings grow at 17 per cent. The Reserve Bank gave an ominous signal of its 
tight money intentions with its unexpected increase in the CRR for Indian banks, 
promoting a sell-off of 900 points on the Sensex. India is expensive compared to 
other BRIC markets such as Brazil (1.9x book value, 12 times forward earnings), 
Russia (1.8x book value, 9 time’s earnings) and even Chinese H shares. It is 
time to underweight India. I would, however, buy telecom major Bharti Airtel on 
any weakness, preferably below Indian Rs 600. Bharti, with 29 million 
subscribers, is easily the most attractive growth story in India, already the 
world’s fifth largest cellular market with a mobile teledensity of 11 per cent, 
compared to China’s 34 per cent.<br>
<b><br>
HK shares</b><br>
Hong Kong/China shares have been a winner in 2006 as low interest rates, a 
liquidity tsunami and 10 per cent GDP growth in the Middle Kingdom continue to 
attract portfolio inflows. The Hang Seng is expensive at 19,000 but property 
bluechips are a better risk-reward play than HSBC, which will be an 
underperformer because it’s subprime consumer subsidiary, Household 
International, simply cannot avoid loan losses as the US housing bubble 
deflates. Meanwhile, HSBC net interest income is squeezed by the invented dollar 
yield curve. Banks in Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore have far more value than 
the trillion-dollar balance sheet HSBC, which is a global bank, not just an 
Asian bank. Stanchart offers far higher growth but at a much higher multiple and 
strategic stakes by the governments of Singapore and Dubai make a takeover bid 
prohibitively expensive. Chinese H shares offer greater value, with a 12,000 
target not unthinkable.<br>
<br>
A Hong Kong share worth owning is Hutchinson Telecom, which provides mobile 
services in Hong Kong, Thailand and India (80 per cent of revenues are from 
India). India’s teledensity will double in the next four years. Hutchinson 
Telecom is launching a growth initiative in Vietnam and Indonesia. On the whole, 
however, it is time to be cautious and not get caught in the trap of irrational 
exuberance.</font></p>

DUBAI’S NICO in Kazakhstan Ship Repair Yard JV</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="bsbr.jpg" width="200" height="145" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Three 
maritime majors have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to 
establish a joint venture to develop a vessel maintenance and repair facility on 
the Caspian Sea Coast of Kazakhstan. Dubai-based Nico International, a 
subsidiary of the Topaz Energy and Marine Group owned by Renaissance Services 
SAOG, a publicly listed Omani Company; Almaty-based Caspian Services Inc. (CSI); 
and, the national marine company of Kazakhstan, Kazmortransflot JSC (KMTF) 
signed the MoU at Dubai World Trade Centre. The facility is to be constructed on 
the grounds of the marine base currently under development by CSI at the port of 
Bautino in Kazakhstan. It will be designed to provide both dry docking and 
floating repair capabilities to the full range of vessels operating in the 
Caspian Sea, up to a maximum 60 metres in length and 600 tonnes ‘lightship’. The 
facility will also have the capability to dry berth eight vessels at one time. 
Nico International will develop and operate the facility on behalf of the JV.
<br>
<br>
Nico is a Dubai-based international ship repair and boat building company with 
30 years experience in the industry. With 1,200 employees and operations in four 
countries, Nico operates eight companies dedicated to the full spectrum of ship 
repair. Nico recently inaugurated a new marine workshop in Bautino which is 
staffed by Kazakh marine engineers and supervised by skilled Nico personnel. 
Nico General Manager Fazel A. Fazelbhoy stated: “We are excited at the prospect 
of setting up the first international level ship repair facility in Kazakhstan. 
We have already trained 12 Kazakh graduates from the Marine Academy in Aktau, 
Kazakhstan, in our workshops in Dubai and are now looking to further expand our 
horizons to the Caspian Sea. Our sister company BUE Kazakh operates over 40 
vessels and this is a logical extension of our service and investment commitment 
to a rapidly developing oil economy.”<br>

<img border="0" src="bsbr1.jpg" width="150" height="95" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Preparations are well underway for Oman’s biggest festival, which will take 
place in Muscat between January 1 and February 2, 2007. The Muscat Festival is 
an annual event that focuses on culture and tourism, and officials are promising 
that this year it will be bigger and better. Last year, the festival saw record 
attendance at the festival, with 2.2 million turning out, but organisers are 
confident that this figure can be surpassed.<br>
<br>
This year, Muscat Festival’s focus is on heritage and culture. “Muscat Festival 
has always been a window to showcase the cultural richness of the country, and 
this year too the emphasis will be on the various aspects of our culture, past 
and present,” said Abdullah bin Abbas bin Ahmed, president of Muscat 
Municipality. “There is a special significance to the festival this time, 
because it coincides with Muscat’s celebrations as the Arab Cultural Capital for 
2006. So the programmes and events will particularly focus on the city’s rich 
heritage and culture,” he added.<br>
<br>
The major attractions at the event will include 
an Oman cultural village, Arabian markets, 
international theatre, and a forum of 
peoples’ cultures. “This year’s 
festival will have lot of new fea-tures that makes it even more
interesting than its predecessors. The Heritage Village in Qurum 
will have a completely new and refurbished look,” added Abdullah.<br>

felicitated with the prestigious Sea Trade Award for ‘Outstanding Success in 
Port and Terminal Operations’. The Sea Trade Awards are given to the best 
performers in the maritime industry from the Middle East Region and South Asia. 
Jamal Aziz, Deputy CEO, Sohar Industrial Port Company (SIPC), said: “Our success 
was due to the invaluable support of the Port of Rotterdam in the management by 
the port working with the Government of Oman to establish a modern 
infrastructure.” The Port of Sohar, an industrial port, situated 220 km 
northwest of Muscat, has added a new episode in the development of futuristic 
port facilities in Oman. Set up in 2002, the port along with its container 
project is one of the largest of its kind in the world. The Port is fast 
receiving international recognition because of the large number of industries 
and financial investment it has attracted. A key factor in its speedy growth has 
been its location outside the Straits of Hormuz. <br>

        <img border="0" src="gcc.jpg" width="400" height="249"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="1" face="Verdana">The Middle East hotel market continues to enjoy double-digit growth for 
        the fourth consecutive year – with revenue per available room (revPAR) 
        increasing 13.6 per cent – reveal the half-yearly results from the 
        HotelBenchmark survey by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte). And in the 
        Middle East, Muscat saw the strongest growth, with revPAR up 54.8 per 
        cent to US$164.<br>
        <br>
        The growth in Muscat has been driven predominately by an impressive 44.2 
        per cent increase in average room rates. Hoteliers continue to benefit 
        from the closure of four key hotels for extensive refurbishment due to 
        scheduled upgrades. Also, the June cyclone caused significant 
        infrastructure damage and forced many residents to shift into temporary 
        hotel accommodation.<br>
        <br>
        Said Lorna Clarke, executive director of HotelBenchmark, “as expected, 
        hotel performance across the Middle East has slowed slightly compared to 
        last year but is still in double-digit territory. The level of 
        investment continues to surprise. In the first quarter of 2007, US$2 
        billion was pumped into the hotel sector. Given the continued 
        investment, strong economic performance, and the attention the region 
        commands, it is not hard to see why the Middle East has the highest 
        revPAR in the world.”<br>
        <br>
        During the first six months of 2007, revPAR increased by US$17, fuelled 
        by improvements in average room rates. At US$108, the Middle East 
        continues to boast the highest revPAR for any region – above Asia 
        Pacific and Europe levels of US$97 and US$100, respectively. Behind the 
        figures, however, the markets across the region have their own stories 
        to tell. There is a huge regional disparity in revPAR; with Dubai 
        topping the scales at US$255 compared to Luxor at US$24.<br>
        <br>
        Riyadh took second place after Muscat, with revPAR increasing by 40.3 
        per cent over the period to reach US$170. Again, the performance was 
        largely due to growth in average room rates, which topped US$200 – among 
        the highest in the region. <br>
        <br>
        Another market enjoying a good year was Damascus. The Syrian capital 
        pushed occupancy up 20.7 per cent to 59 per cent, resulting in a 31.8 
        per cent improvement in revPAR. At US$57, this is still relatively low 
        compared to other markets but confirms that Syria’s strategy to promote 
        its unique historical legacy is paying off.<br>
        <br>
        In Egypt, hoteliers have at last started to see performance bounce back 
        with all markets reporting double-digit revPAR growth during the first 
        half, with the Red Sea Resorts leading the growth reporting revPAR 
        increases of over 30 per cent. These have been driven mainly by 
        occupancy, which is now just below 70 per cent.<br>
        <br>
        Average room rates in Egypt do, however, remain among the lowest in the 
        region, making the country a very competitive holiday destination. Egypt 
        is extending its appeal by diversifying its offerings and attracting 
        more tourists looking for city breaks, medical and wellness tourism.<br>
        <br>
        Beirut and Doha were the only markets to report negative growth in 
        revPAR this year. This was not surprising given the tensions between 
        Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, Beirut saw occupancy levels plummet to 
        32.9 per cent, with its revPAR declining to US$39, the lowest for the 
        region.<br>
        <br>
        Doha also saw Hotel revPAR decline by 3.6 per cent, following the peak 
        levels seen in 2006 when the city hosted the Asian Games. Hoteliers also 
        suffered at the hands of new supply following the partial opening of the 
        Ritz Carlton Sharq Village and Spa, and the Movenpick Tower and Suites 
        Doha. In addition, the Ramada Doha increased room count by over 120. 
        Despite this, however, the city still boasts the second highest revPAR 
        in the region after Dubai.<br>
        <br>
        Comments Rob O’Hanlon, tourism, hospitality and leisure partner, 
        Deloitte Middle East, “the hotel industry (in the region) continues to 
        benefit from increased airline capacity, events and new attractions. 
        infrastructure developments and effective marketing campaigns are also 
        all helping to raise the profile of the region worldwide. So, with this 
        in mind, we expect hotels across the region to continue to reap the 
        rewards.”</font></p>

        <b>IDC: Gulf PC market to grow 16% p.a.</b><br>
        The PC market in the Gulf states continued its steep upward course, 
        expanding 34.4 per cent in volume and 31.7 per cent in value terms 
        year-on-year to almost 2.2 million units valued at US$2.40 billion, 
        according to the latest study from IDC. The report further states the 
        expansion was driven by strong demand for notebooks as well as by 
        ongoing and new IT infrastructure deployments in major vertical markets, 
        such as the government, oil and gas, banking and insurance, and 
        telecommunications, and heightened demand from small and medium-size 
        enterprises, including the SOHO segment.<br>
        <br>
        The Gulf market is dominated by international players, with only one of 
        the top ten vendors being a local vendor. The top three vendors were HP, 
        Acer, and Dell, whose combined market share reached almost two-thirds of 
        total shipments.<br>
        <br>
        The UAE and Saudi Arabia continued to make up the largest share of PC 
        shipments in the region, accounting for an over 81 per cent share in 
        2006. The third largest market, Kuwait, had a share that was just 
        one-tenth of the two biggest markets combined.<br>
        <br>
        Notebooks were again the most dynamic market drivers, with shipments 
        rocketing up 61 per cent year-on-year and comprising 57.5 per cent unit 
        share of the market. Desktop shipments also continued to grow in 2006, 
        although at a much slower pace (at less than 10 per cent) and made up 
        40.5 per cent share of the market. Shipments of x86 servers grew 11 per 
        cent year-on-year in 2006, as more SMBs purchased these machines and 
        large and very large businesses renewed their existing server 
        infrastructure as part of regular replacement cycles.<br>
        <br>
        IDC expects the Gulf PC market to expand at an average annual rate of 
        over 16 per cent in volume over the next five years. “Continued economic 
        growth will fuel expansion in the Gulf states PC market,” said Omar 
        Shihab, research manager, IDC MEA. “Uptake of notebook PCs, the rollout 
        of numerous IT infrastructure projects, and PC renewal and upgrade 
        cycles in the corporate and government sectors will also play a role,” 
        he added.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Moody’s GCC economic outlook</b><br>
        The widespread application of Basel II norms, a standard for capital 
        adequacy norms for banks, is having a positive effect on the local 
        banking systems, says Moody’s in its first-half report on the Gulf 
        region. It said this was enabling institutions to look at their balance 
        sheets in a more risk-oriented way, although high liquidity still mutes 
        core-financing drivers for securitisation. The improving economic 
        situation in the Gulf was evident from the A and Aa ratings of the six 
        GCC governments, much higher than their ratings just a few years ago.<br>
        <br>
        The marked improvement in the economic fundamentals of the Gulf 
        countries has mainly been caused by the sustained rise in global 
        hydrocarbon prices over the past five years. Based on current spending 
        patterns, break-even oil prices are around US$35-40 per barrel. Moody’s 
        says that compared to prior oil-related economic booms, oil income is 
        currently being used more on capital investment than on current 
        spending. Most governments are proceeding with structural reforms aimed 
        at boosting the role of the private sector despite the jump in 
        government revenues. Nonetheless, despite improving economics and rapid 
        GDP growth, the regional political environment remains challenging. 
        However, the large net asset positions and low levels of gross debt 
        suggest that it will take a severe and sustained adverse political 
        scenario to cause a government bond default, either in local or foreign 
        currency.<br>
        <br>
        Moody’s also pointed out that individually, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi 
        Arabia have less hydrocarbon reserves per capita and somewhat weaker 
        government balance sheets. As such, there still remains a relative 
        difference in the ability of these governments to service their debt. 
        Moody’s, however, envisages that the size of the rating differential 
        between them will narrow down over time, as their public finances 
        strengthen, while the ratings of the richer ones are increasingly 
        constrained by political and institutional factors. Reflecting these 
        considerations, the outlooks for Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia 
        government bond ratings are positive. <br>

        is expected to scale nearly 12 per cent in 2008, while average inflation 
        is likely to moderate to 10 per cent and a little over 8 per cent, 
        respectively. Although, Qatar’s inflation was expected to fall, its 
        levels remain the highest among other GCC nations, according to Saudi 
        Arabia’s Al Rajhi Bank.<br>
        <br>
        Qatar’s inflation had peaked to a record high of about 15 per cent in 
        the first quarter after which it moderated to about 13 per cent in the 
        second quarter. “Qatar and the UAE have experienced the highest 
        inflation rates in the Gulf, particularly in housing,” the bank said, 
        adding average residential rentals had increased by 83 per cent in Doha 
        over the last two years against 60 per cent in Dubai. Moreover, rent as

        The Saudi Arabian General Investments Authority (SAGIA) has announced a 
        remarkable flow of foreign investments into Saudi Arabia in the last 
        three years. It noted that the volume of foreign investments in 2006 
        amounted to SR68.6 billion (US$18.3 billion), while the volume of the 
        domestic investments amounted to about SR125 billion (US$33.4 billion) 
        in the same year. Dr Awad al-Awad, the undersecretary to the governor of 
        SAGIA, pointed out that the Kingdom has continued to attract foreign 
        investments from US, Japan and the European Union. He said that in 2006, 
        the biggest portion of the foreign investments was directed to the 
        industry of energy and its derivatives. He added the decision of the 
        ministry of commerce and industry to reduce the cost of establishing a 
        company will positively contribute to increasing the number of

        (KISR) reported the quake’s epicentre was in the southern Manageesh 
        area. Tremors lasted 90 seconds. The earthquake was the strongest in 
        Western Kuwait but the oil facilities were not affected by it. In the

        fifth one, said astronomer Adel Al-Saadoun of Fintas Observatory Center. 
        However, luckily none of those quakes were strong. In 2005, Kuwaiti

        Lothar Drescher, the general manager of performance car firm RUF-Bahrain, 
        has said the first cars built in Bahrain will roll off the production 
        line before the end of the year. He said the US$20 million RUF-Bahrain

        is set to start manufacturing the firm’s high-end vehicles in October. 
        He added that the firm is studying the possibility of shipping cars from 
        Bahrain to the US as it looks to crack the American market. The 
        US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA) means the firm could ship cars 
        directly to the US. “I believe Bahrain has a lot of potential as a car 
        manufacturing location. It is geographically well centred in the GCC; 
        there is also a tax advantage – for example in comparison with Germany – 
        which has quite a huge impact. We will get most of the items in what we 
        call ‘knocked down’ state – the engine parts will be in bits and pieces 
        and it will all be assembled here,” he said.<br>

        The new RUF-Bahrain Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Facility is 
        the first facility German carmaker RUF Automobile has built outside of

        A human rights society is stepping up its campaign to combat sex

        Society for Human Rights is investigating the perpetrators behind 
        websites that are offering sex to customers here and in other Gulf 
        countries. It believes raising awareness about sex trafficking and

        <br>
        “I want this issue to be discussed in the community, on websites and in 
        the media,” said BYSHR president Mohammed Al Maskati in the report which 
        further states that the move follows the group’s discovery that women 
        from Europe, Middle East and Asia were being brought to Bahrain and 
        advertised for sex through more than 50 Arabic and English websites. 
        According to the report, he said that Bahrain’s amnesty scheme that 
        allows illegal workers and residents to leave the country without 
        penalty is an ideal opportunity for victims of sex trafficking to free

        <b>50,000 recycled mobiles in UAE</b><br>
        <b>
        <img border="0" src="gcc13.jpg" width="200" height="130" align="right" hspace="10"></b>EnviroFone has collected 50,000 handsets so far in its campaign to 
        recycle old and damaged mobile phones in the UAE. The company started 
        the campaign in mid-June to protect the environment from contaminated 
        and harmful toxins found in mobile equipment. Citizens can deposit 
        unwanted mobile phones at 270 drop boxes across the UAE and have the 
        chance to win prizes, including air tickets to London.<br>

        <b>JWT Dubai makes history</b><br>
        Proving wrong the critics who doubt the creative work churned out in the 
        GCC region, JWT Dubai has become the first advertising agency in the 
        Middle East to have a piece of its work chosen for inclusion in the 
        Poster collection of the Louvre’s Musée de la Publicité in Paris. 
        Selected by the museum’s curator, the campaign for Double A printer 
        paper joins a prestigious collection featuring 45,000 contemporary 
        posters and over 40,000 French and foreign period posters ranging from 
        the mid 18th century to the 1950s. The campaign, created to highlight 
        Double A’s high quality paper, portrays words like: Freedom, Peace and 
        Justice, which are smudged and blurred because the paper used was jammed 
        in the printer. The idea being that had the user chosen Double A printer 
        paper instead, these great thoughts would not get stuck. The Musée de la 
        Publicité is located in the Palais du Louvre in Paris. In addition to 
        the poster collection, the museum also displays TV, Radio and Press 
        advertising from around the world spanning the past three centuries. </font><br>

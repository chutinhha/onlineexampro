                    Aftab Patel, chief executive officer of Al Omaniya Financial 
                    Services, shares the secrets of his business success with 
                    Vicky Kapur<br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="profile.jpg" align="left" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="150" height="179"></b>Not many are blessed with the foresight and conviction 
                    that this man possesses. At the tender age of 10, Aftab 
                    Patel, now 48, had the objective of his life clear before 
                    him: creating wealth. <br>
                    And create wealth he did. As the CEO of the RO35 million 
                    (net assets) Al Omaniya Financial Services, Patel has been 
                    working hard to fulfil his childhood dream of generating 
                    wealth; for, wealth he believes liberates men and society.
                    <br>
                    Patel would, perhaps, wholeheartedly concur with Wall 
                    Street's Gordon Gecko's famous words: 'Greed is good.' 
                    &quot;Creating wealth for me is almost like a religious 
                    activity,&quot; says Patel. &quot;I was greatly influenced by the 
                    suffering and poverty in India,&quot; he says, adding &quot;I would do 
                    anything I can to pull people out of the morass they get 
                    into due to poverty.&quot;<br>
                    Poverty, for Patel, is among the greatest evils of society. 
                    &quot;It strips people of their dignity, their self-respect, and 
                    binds them in the daily grind of making both ends meet.&quot; 
                    Wealth creation, on the other hand, is the source of &quot;real 
                    freedom - it offers the freedom of thought and belief.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Outperform yourself </b><br>
                    While Patel's story isn't exactly one of rags-to-riches, it 
                    is undoubtedly one of sheer hard work, determination and 
                    commitment. The urge in him to go beyond the ordinary and 
                    better the benchmarks made him take calculated risks at 
                    strategic points in his career, resulting in his phenomenal 
                    success. &quot;I believe I have succeeded in creating real value, 
                    real wealth. That's what one feels happy about - seeing your 
                    vision translated into reality,&quot; he says.<br>
                    A quick look at the financials of Al Omaniya would make one 
                    agree that Patel has reason to believe that his cherished 
                    dream has come true. Starting with an initial capital of RO3 
                    million, the company has today, under the deft leadership of 
                    Patel, grown into one of the largest financial services 
                    company in Oman, with a paid-up capital of RO5 million and 
                    net assets of RO35 million as of December 2002. <br>
                    Patel, however, believes that it is his staff - the 
                    intellectual capital of the company - that have made this 
                    growth possible. &quot;My job here is, essentially, providing 
                    direction, vision and stimulus to the intellectual capital 
                    of the company,&quot; he insists. &quot;I ensure that a creative 
                    environment is in place that breeds the right kind of 
                    people, which is so necessary for the growth of the 
                    company.&quot; <br>
                    It was in 1990 that Patel joined BankMuscat's consumer 
                    finance division, and was part of the bank's core team of 
                    the retail finance division till 1997. In a way, 1997 was 
                    the watershed year for Patel. That was when a group of 
                    investors got together and acquired the retail business from 
                    BankMuscat - and Al Omaniya Financial Services was born.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Management by objectives<br>
                    </b>&quot;I believe in creating an environment of empowerment by 
                    knowledge,&quot; he says. And that's exactly what he has done at 
                    Al Omaniya. &quot;We have institutionalised the ownership of 
                    processes, where each employee is individually as well as 
                    collectively responsible for the organisational objectives,&quot; 
                    affirms Patel. <br>
                    He ensures that the right procedures, systems and technology 
                    are in place to maintain a relatively low-risk and 
                    error-free environment that facilitates the work culture 
                    necessary to create knowledge workers. <br>
                    Patel follows a balanced approach to keep his staff 
                    motivated. &quot;My management style is neither top-centred, nor 
                    completely laissez faire,&quot; he says. While he does involve 
                    his staff in the decision-making process, he believes that 
                    it is his responsibility to drive the business forward. As 
                    he sums up: &quot;I'm a facilitator of ideas, a driving force for 
                    the business, the one who makes the call, the risk-taker, 
                    and the one providing the conviction for going on.&quot; <br>
                    Is the financial services company, then, a one-man show? Not 
                    at all, claims Patel. &quot;I do identify business opportunities 
                    where they exist, because you have to be very careful with 
                    the timing and methodology for a business project. But once 
                    that is done, my role is purely supervisory.&quot; Patel sees 
                    providing general direction to the business movements as his 
                    most important task. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>In the long term, we're all dead</b> <br>
                    While Patel does believe in creating what he calls &quot;enduring 
                    values&quot; in the organisation, he insists that his staff are 
                    trained to ensure that short- and medium-term progress isn't 
                    sacrificed at the altar of long-term growth. He maintains 
                    that the cautious growth pattern that his company follows 
                    stands for &quot;substantially better than average growth.&quot; <br>
                    The three-pronged approach that he follows for his company 
                    is:
                  </font></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                      Short term: Steadily generate cash flows and maintain 
                      them.</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                      Medium term: Create new streams of incomes and products, 
                      and put the necessary infrastructure in place.
                  </font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                      Long term: Have the focus right. Create employment and 
                      wealth for everyone involved.
                  </font></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                    &quot;If you want extraordinary growth, you can't leave things on 
                    their own pace,&quot; philosophises Patel. &quot;You have to be 
                    careful about the direction of business movement.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Through the looking glass<br>
                    </b>&quot;I am a thinking person, a rational being, a citizen of 
                    the world,&quot; says Patel. But his &quot;inability to tolerate 
                    mediocrity&quot; is what he feels is his among his prime 
                    weaknesses. &quot;I want to do a lot more, and expect people to 
                    do the same. When I don't get what I expect, that leads to 
                    regrets. I think my expectations from people are sometimes 
                    too high, and thus end up feeling let down when they cannot 
                    live up to those expectations,&quot; he explains. <br>
                    But isn't the ambition to do a lot more and expect others to 
                    outperform themselves every time an asset rather than a 
                    weakness? &quot;We're not living in a world of only 
                    intellectuals. A majority of us are average human beings. 
                    One must learn to live with the common denominator,&quot; he 
                    clarifies. <br>
                    Patel considers morality to be the greatest virtue of an 
                    individual, and believes in the tenets of truthfulness. 
                    &quot;Transparency and ethics are my biggest strengths,&quot; he 
                    claims. &quot;They may make me go slow at times, but they make me 
                    go forward with conviction. I don't do anything that I don't 
                    believe in.&quot; Perhaps which is why Al Omaniya has never had 
                    to withdraw a product after launching it. &quot;We believe in 
                    credibility. We move cautiously, but decisively,&quot; affirms 
                    Patel. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Personal log<br>
                    </b>It helps matters that Patel's wife, Afshan, is a 
                    chartered accountant by qualification too. Having worked 
                    with various international organisations including the 
                    University of Toronto and Central Bank of Oman (Muscat, 
                    Oman), she is a perfect sounding board for Patel. &quot;For me, 
                    business communication becomes personal communication when I 
                    can discuss with my wife matters that I would not 
                    necessarily want to discuss with my staff.&quot; <br>
                    At present a homemaker, Afshan has been a &quot;great strength 
                    and a source of inspiration&quot; for Patel all through. They 
                    have two daughters, studying at the American British Academy 
                    in Grade 7 and 4, who've joined Patel this year and for whom 
                    &quot;Muscat is like home now.&quot;<br>
                    The Patels dovetail their social life into their hobbies, 
                    and love to spend their leisure time at the gym, in the 
                    pool, or playing indoor games like table tennis. While Patel 
                    is not a member of any cultural group, he is still active 
                    culturally, attending a lot of cultural shows and functions. 
                    &quot;Al Omaniya represents the annual mushayira in Oman, and I 
                    am, willy-nilly, a part of it. Apart from that, I also 
                    attend a lot of social events locally.&quot;<br>
                    If he wasn't a financial whiz kid, he would probably be a 
                    poet, a writer, or a philosopher, insists Patel. Reading is 
                    his favourite pastime, and he never misses going to a 
                    bookshop whenever he visits another part of the world. His 
                    interests are diverse - from arts, philosophy and literature 
                    to technical subjects and business magazines.<br>
                    &quot;Reading on philosophy enriches your soul, and reading 
                    business magazines does the same for your mind. I read a mix 
                    of both - for the body and for the soul,&quot; reflects Patel. 
                    Among the recent books he's read are The City of Joy by 
                    Dominique Lapierre and An Area of Darkness by V.S. Naipaul. 
                    &quot;I have been tremendously influenced by The City, and both 
                    these books gave me two different perspectives on India,&quot; he 
                    says.

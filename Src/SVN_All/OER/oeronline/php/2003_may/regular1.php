            <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>How does Iraq measure up against 
            its old adversaries in the all-important oil stakes?<br>
            </b>Iraq is an economic analyst's nightmare. How do you measure a 
            country that hasn't even been measuring itself for the best part of 
            20 years? Some economic data are floated around in discussions about 
            'the rebirth of the Iraqi economy'. But the truth is that aside from 
            broad generalisations, no one really knows what shape Iraq is in.<br>
            The one thing we do know, though, is that Iraq has oil. But just how 
            much? And, perhaps most interesting of all, how does its oil clout 
            measure up against that of its former foes? In the past two decades, 
            Iraq has been to war with Iran, Kuwait, the United States and the 
            United Kingdom. By some measures, Iraq trumps all of them. By 
            others, predictably, it is right at the bottom of the pile. <br>
            First, oil reserves. Much has been made of Iraq's vast - and largely 
            untapped - hydrocarbon wealth. But just how much oil lies underneath 
            the expansive desert, in absolute and real terms? <br>
            The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) estimates 
            Iraq's oil reserves at 112 billion barrels - equivalent to around 11 
            per cent of the global total. This puts Iraq ahead of all its 
            erstwhile military opponents. In fairness to its Middle East rivals, 
            they boast just under 100 billion barrels each themselves, and the 
            margin of error in the data may well be greater than the divide. So 
            Iraq comes out on top, but only just. <br>
            However, pitch Iraq against its more recent adversaries - the US and 
            the UK - and it's a very different story. Both are considered major 
            oil producers, yet their combined reserves of 27 billion barrels are 
            less than a quarter of Iraq's. (Of course, Messrs Bush and Blair 
            deny the recent invasion was about securing access to/control of 
            vital Iraqi reserves in the face of dwindling domestic crude 
            stocks.) Iraq's oil reserves are the world's second largest, 
            according to OPEC, after Saudi Arabia's mighty 263 billion barrels.<br>
            Perhaps most important of all, Iraq scores highly in the key 
            Reserves/Production (R/P) ratio. In other words, Iraq is conserving 
            its oil. At current production levels of around 2 million barrels 
            per day (b/d), Iraqi oil will last for 150 years. Similarly, Middle 
            East neighbours Iran and Kuwait are fairly conservative in their 
            output. At current levels, oil in Iran (3.5 million b/d) will last 
            for 80 years while Kuwait (2 million b/d) will not run out of oil 
            until well into the 23rd century. <br>
            Not so the US and the UK. America produced 8 million barrels per day 
            b/d in 2002. At that rate, oil will run out in less than 10 years. 
            Britain's prospects are even worse. Last year it pumped an average 
            2.5 million b/d - a level it can sustain for little more than five 
            years. New techniques will probably extend the life of fields in 
            both countries, but the writing is clearly on the wall for domestic 
            production.<br>
            For these reasons, Iraq's oil is going to become more precious over 
            time. The International Energy Agency (IEA, the West's energy 
            watchdog) says Middle East OPEC oil will come to dominate the global 
            energy scene over the coming 30 years, as world oil demand rises 
            from 75 million b/d to 120 million b/d by 2030. &quot;Most of the 
            projected 60 per cent increase in global oil demand in the next 
            three decades will be met by OPEC producers, particularly those in 
            the Middle East. Output from mature regions such as North America 
            and the North Sea will gradually decline.&quot; <br>
            It is clear, then, that talk of Iraq as a major oil power is 
            well-founded. Indeed, the figures may well hide the true extent of 
            Iraq's oil riches, given that they are woefully out of date. The 
            Energy Information Administration (EIA), part of the US Government's 
            Department of Energy, stresses that Iraq's oil reserves may be 
            almost as large as Saudi's. And it adds that they rank among the 
            most easily accessible on earth. <br>
            &quot;Deep oil-bearing formations located mainly in the vast Western 
            Desert region, for instance, could yield large additional oil 
            resources (possibly another 100 billion barrels), but have not been 
            explored,&quot; says the EIA in a recent report on Iraq. &quot;However, only 
            15 of 73 discovered fields have been developed, while few deep wells 
            have been drilled compared to Iraq's neighbours.&quot; Overall, only 
            about 2,000 wells have been drilled in Iraq, compared to around 1 
            million wells in Texas. <br>
            This rich potential only underlines the extent of the tragic waste 
            of Iraq's precious resources in recent years. Despite almost 
            unrivalled oil wealth, Iraq is one of the poorest countries in the 
            Middle East. OPEC figures reveal that GDP per capita was around 
            $1,100 in 2001, although this figure undoubtedly flatters the plight 
            of the average Iraqi. By contrast, US GDP per capita was around 
            $36,000 in the same year. <br>
            What does all this mean for Iraq's future production - and the 
            likely impact on oil markets? The world's financial media is full of 
            doomsday predictions about the impact free-flowing Iraqi crude will 
            have on the value of Gulf oil exports. Pessimists argue that the US 
            will effectively take over Iraq's position as OPEC's 11th member, 
            and hike production as quickly as possible in a bid to flood the 
            global market and bring down prices. <br>
            Don't rely on this. By the time Iraqi production can reach 4 million 
            b/d - 2006 at the most optimistic estimate - production will already 
            be dwindling from British and American wells. The worst that can 
            happen is that a temporary supply glut towards the middle/end of the 
            current decade does indeed drive down the price of crude. But in the 
            long-term, this will benefit the Middle East, as it will drive 
            high-cost rivals out of business, especially those in deep-water 
            West Africa and the Caspian Sea. The message is clear: the forces of 
            economics are loaded in favour of Middle East oil producers, and an 
            upsurge in Iraqi production will do little to dent them.</font></p>

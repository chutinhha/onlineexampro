            Soon after the completion of my studies in 1980, I started working 
            in India. In 1990 I came down to Oman and took up a job in a 
            completely different faculty, and nine years later I returned to my 
            country to give shape to my dream of starting a stock brokerage 
            firm, which unfortunately didn't do well. Therefore, I decided to 
            venture back into Oman in 2001 when I received an offer from Moosa 
            Abdul Rahman and Company.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The company </b><br>
            Moosa Abdul Rahman and Company is one of the oldest business groups 
            existing in the Sultanate with a strong market reputation and 
            heritage. <br>
            <br>
            <b>The past </b><br>
            Forty years back, there were only two brands of vehicles plying in 
            Oman, one of which was Bedford trucks, distributed by us. The 
            Bedford franchise gave a leverage to our business, where the ROP 
            (Royal Oman Police), the government and leading corporate entities 
            were our customers. We also held the franchise for the Australian 
            Holden saloon cars, but it was a low-key affair, and it was Bedford 
            that put us in the mainstream. During the mid-1970s we acquired the 
            Pontiac dealership (discontinued later). By mid-1980s the business 
            for Bedford started drying up and in 1990s the company started 
            distributing Opel and GMC vehicles. Both these brands carved a niche 
            in the local market since they were not mass market products (hence 
            low business volumes). In 2001 the management decided to get into a 
            more aggressive mode and acquired the dealership for Suzuki, which 
            put us back into the big league. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Management philosophy </b><br>
            We have an incredibly open working environment, where we are given a 
            free hand in running the business without any direct interference 
            from the promoters. Our chairman, Abdulla Moosa once said to me, 
            &quot;Neither I nor my family will interfere with the way you run the 
            business or else I will not be able to hold you accountable.&quot; The 
            total empowerment and confidence reposed in us inspires us to 
            perform to the best of our abilities. Of course, it also places a 
            big responsibility at the same time. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Employee management </b><br>
            Management of our manpower resources is a reflection of our 
            philosophy. Each business is independent and every employee is 
            motivated and inspired to contribute his best.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Leadership style </b><br>
            I believe in consensus and always take decisions after holding 
            discussions with my team. Since I am working with people and not 
            products, I tend to invest a lot of resources in building a good, 
            strong team and in keeping it constantly motivated. I am a very 
            decisive person and never procrastinate since my father used to 
            always tell me a wrong decision in time is better than a delayed 
            right decision. I am a bit conservative and very cautious when it 
            comes to taking risks. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest achievement </b><br>
            The entire team has been successful in making Moosa a highly visible 
            player in the automotive business in the recent past. This has 
            definitely given us a great sense of fulfilment. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest mistake </b><br>
            Giving up a professional career temporarily was a mistake, but in 
            real terms the learning from that was huge at all levels and it 
            provided me with opportunities to grow. <br>
            <br>
            <b>My strength </b><br>
            I am a very practical person. Though I have been to one of the best 
            business schools I rarely step into jargons and theory. I am a 
            'hands on' manager and I do what would be the most practical thing 
            in a given situation.<br>
            <br>
            <b>My weakness</b><br>
            I am a very impatient person, demanding instant results. This does 
            put my people under some pressure. I have seen managers who never 
            get ruffled and I wish I were like that.<br>
            <br>
            <b>My regret </b><br>
            None whatsoever. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Success formula </b><br>
            We believe from our heart we should give the best experience to our 
            employees and customers, and this clear priority has helped us stay 
            focussed and successful.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Competition </b><br>
            We have to compete with some of the most professionally run and best 
            organisations in the business. We have learnt a lot from our 
            competitors. I constantly quote Stalin who, when he took over the 
            reins in USSR, said - &quot;We are 50 years behind the western powers and 
            the next 10 years are very crucial if we intend to make headway.&quot; I 
            believe we have a similar situation prevailing in Moosa. We have a 
            huge gap to bridge if we are to be close to the top players and we 
            are doing everything possible to get there as quickly as possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Motivators</b><br>
            I thrive on independence. I feel motivated and give my best when 
            given total freedom.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Inspirations</b><br>
            Many people and many things inspire me. I have a different role 
            model for each facet. Tiger Woods for golf, Warren Buffet for 
            investing etc. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tips to succeed </b><br>
            One must regard the organisation that he works for as his own. He 
            must run it with the commitment and care that he would have for his 
            own business. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Future plans</b> <br>
            We have aggressive plans for our organisation. We are working 
            towards making it one of the leading players in the industry and are 
            expanding our network and technical capacities. We may even add more 
            brands and products to our portfolio. At a personal level this will 
            be my last job until I retire. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Family </b><br>
            I am married to Tarini for 18 years. She is very versatile and is a 
            teacher, practising artist and Feng-Shui consultant. We have a son 
            (16) and daughter (12) both studying. I owe everything I am today to 
            my parents who live in India but come here very often. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Hobbies</b> <br>
            I enjoy spending time with my family. My children and I are keen 
            about golf. I love reading fiction, news and business magazines, and 
            watching TV. I also have a good art collection.</font></p>

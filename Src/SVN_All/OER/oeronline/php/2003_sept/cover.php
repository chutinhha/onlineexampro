            overview to how the different Gulf States are faring in the 
            employment maze</b><br>
            <br>
            In a regional context, most of the governments in the Gulf have been 
            paying increasingly more attention to the issue of nationalising 
            their workforce. Experts remind us that, historically, for most, the 
            oil boom of the late 1970s and 1980s had a positive effect on the 
            economy but it had also forced the Gulf nations to rely on an 
            international labour force. The ramifications of this are certainly 
            being felt today. According to the World Bank, expatriates represent 
            as much as a third of the 30 million population of the Gulf.<br>
            How are the various Gulf countries doing in terms of education, 
            training and employment for their citizens? If you were to rank the 
            economies in order of adapting to the constraints of their 
            economies, implementing effective employment initiatives, convincing 
            employers to take a role in the process, communicating to the local 
            population effectively about their training system, reducing 
            unemployment and developing areas of the economy like IT 
            (information technology) sector, Oman and Bahrain would definitely 
            score the highest. Economists say that these countries have been 
            forced to react ahead of the rest due to population pressures and 
            dwindling oil reserves. Having said this, these economies still have 
            few nationals in many sectors and skilled positions.<br>
            Meanwhile, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE are further back in their goals 
            to find jobs for nationals. This can be attributed to the economies 
            having a smaller population size and larger oil and gas reserves. 
            Also, the UAE is in a much stronger position to provide employment 
            because it has greater economic diversification than the rest of the 
            GCC.<br>
            Last, but by no means least, Saudi Arabia find itself in a situation 
            that is not so admirable. Indeed, unemployment (conservatively 
            estimated at 29 per cent) has been steadily growing (despite a 
            Saudisation policy that has restricted many professions to Saudi 
            nationals) while the population growth is moving at an explosive 
            pace (see table on population doubling rate).</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">The economies of the six GCC 
              states are all expected to maintain an upward trend recorded over 
              the past few years despite lower oil production this year. Qatar 
              is set to remain the top performer, according to a United Nations 
              report. The combined gross domestic product of the six GCC states 
              recorded a high real growth of 4.25 per cent last year and is 
              projected to grow by around 3.84 per cent this year, said the 
              report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). 
              Even then, this level of GDP growth is not be enough to quell 
              labour force growth (see table with projections for the Gulf) in 
              2003 in some countries: Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman.</font></p>

              is gearing up to offer more job opportunities for its youth. But 
              is enough being done to reach employment targets?<br>
              Should the targets set be administered more quickly?<br>
              Oman's population is growing rapidly and is expected to double to 
              over three million by 2010 and is on course to exceed five million 
              by 2030. Moreover, over 35 per cent of Oman's population is aged 
              15 or under. According to economic trends in the MENA region 
              (Middle East and North Africa), the Sultanate is experiencing the 
              second highest rate of growth of young people between 15 and 24 
              years in the MENA region. Over 590,000 students are enrolled in 
              school for this academic year alone. These young people are going 
              to want the opportunities to build a better life for themselves 
              and their own families. <br>
              A report published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 
              this year shows that the Sultanate's population growth is 
              outstripping its GDP growth. Shedding expatriate employees may 
              seem like a good idea - after all, it is estimated that, on an 
              average, expatriates send up to 70 per cent of their earnings back 
              to their country of origin. However, it may not be the ultimate 
              panacea. <br>
              &quot;Just replacing expats with Omanis will not solve the urgent need 
              for wealth and job creation. Expatriates are, after all, an 
              important key to transferring skills to Omanis,&quot; argues a local 
              employer. Besides, it would also depress domestic demand and 
              dampen economic growth.<br>
              The private sector employer emphasises: &quot;Expatriates are a part of 
              the solution. If every job currently occupied by an expat was 
              Omanised, we shall not have solved the problem. The rate of young 
              Omanis coming onto the job market requires significant economic 
              growth to create more employment opportunities. Expats and Omanis 
              alike should work hard to assist this process.&quot;<br>
              <img border="0" src="pg20a.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="144">Nevertheless, 
              there is certainly a self-serving group of expatriates who are 
              cynical about Omanisation and they employ processes that are 
              covertly designed to block promotional opportunities for Omani 
              nationals while protecting the interests of their own people. 
              Omanisation is seen as a thin end of a very difficult wedge for 
              certain expatriate communities,&quot; argues Mark Hobbs, a training 
              consultant in Oman.<br>
              &quot;Misinformation is self-serving. Some expatriates are guilty of 
              this because it fits their present purpose to say Omanisation is a 
              process that is impossible. Having the opportunity to work in a 
              meaningful job matched to their skills is the inalienable right of 
              every Omani. Rather than being impossible, Omanisation is a 
              powerful, irreversible process that more than anything else will 
              deliver the government's Vision 2020,&quot; he adds.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Training places</b><br>
              This summer, Sultan Qaboos University announced that it would only 
              accept 2,400 candidates out of 41,568 matriculating from school 
              this year. Where are the others going to find the training that 
              they hope will equip them with the skills that will secure them a 
              job or profession? Private universities, such as at Sohar and the 
              planned Nizwa institution, will be able to accept other students, 
              mainly for business administration, IT and applied science 
              courses. The private medical college in Muscat will be able to 
              accept 40 students, as will the new Oman Pharmacy College. It has 
              been estimated that if the 14 private, licensed institutions can 
              provide an additional 2,400 places, 11 per cent of matriculating 
              students will be able to pursue higher studies. Some lucky 
              students with families of means will study overseas. Other young 
              people will attend the seven colleges of technology being 
              established around the country where they can learn a trade and 
              vocational subjects.<br>
              At least 1,500 additional training places will be available 
              through Ministry of Manpower programmes. The ministry is putting 
              greater emphasis on the encouragement of entrepreneurship, 
              self-reliance and direct training input from the private sector, 
              as well as sponsoring training through approved training 
              companies. The SANAD programme is also playing its part in 
              boosting Omanisation (see page 23).<br>
              &quot;Not all Omanis have the interest or aptitude to start a business 
              and make it a success. We run training programmes for initiatives 
              like SANAD and Intilaaqah which are designed to identify, assist 
              and foster those Omanis who do have an aptitude for 
              self-employment and enterprise,&quot; notes Taki Al Abduwani, managing 
              director of Deslie Training Institute.<br>
              In July, the Ministry of Manpower signed pacts worth more than 
              RO2.6 million (US$6.76 million) with 10 local training companies 
              to train 961 Omanis for the private sector in information 
              technology, retail sales, operation of heavy vehicles, printing, 
              printing design, photography, production and selling of printed 
              materials, seaport operation and roles in hotels and tourism.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The public sector</b><br>
              The government has absorbed many Omanis in the past, but there is 
              a limit to which the civil service can grow. For one thing, the 
              civil service is not economically productive. It saps national 
              income in order to pay salaries and build national infrastructure. 
              Retrenchment of the government sector, for example, by retiring 
              older employees, also has a follow-on effect on the private 
              sector, which often finds that it has to downsize, according to 
              the ILO.<br>
              Despite an acknowledged need to curb the growth of the civil 
              service, 6,278 more Omanis were employed by government in 2002 
              than in 2001 albeit many were recruited into education and health 
              as teachers and nurses. Over 1,000 newly trained Omani junior 
              nurses are expected to join the health service by 2004.<br>
              Training programmes<br>
              There is much to praise in the drive to Omanise the private 
              sector. Banking is already 95 per cent Omanised while Petro-leum 
              Development Oman predicts virtually full Omanisation by 2007. Many 
              other companies have taken on young people to learn trades such as 
              mechanics, welding or carpentry. OPAL (Oman Society for Petroleum 
              Services) struck an agreement with the Ministry of Manpower in 
              June 2002 to train a further 5,000 Omanis over the next five years 
              (see page 25).<br>
              It is evident that there aren't enough training places for 
              everyone although the Ministry of Manpower is undoubtedly a 
              driving force. There remain an untold number of young people who 
              drop out of school without acquiring qualifications. The problem 
              is worse for young women, given that the proportion of women in 
              the private sector workforce is approximately 18 per cent, and 
              that women may not get the opportunities that young men do.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Education as the basis</b><br>
              Wherever you are in the world, the unqualified and the illiterate 
              are those who are most likely to be out of work, and those who 
              fall below the poverty line. This is why the current educational 
              reform programme is so important in encouraging all youngsters to 
              develop their curiosity, initiative and problem-solving skills. 
              Yahya bin Saud bin Mansour Al Sulaimi, minister of education, said 
              in July, &quot;(The new) assessment system seeks to ensure that the 
              student becomes active and interactive, participates and expresses 
              his/her views, and analyses the learning situations, which he/she 
              experiences.&quot; The aim is to provide young people with the skills, 
              outlook and qualifications, which will equip them for the working 
              world. Providing the necessary infrastructure for life-long 
              learning is also another way to augment Oman's existing talent 
              pool.<br>
              &quot;A strategic alignment of the education system with employment 
              needs is beginning to happen. By improving the education of Omanis, 
              retaining the best of the Arabic curriculum, and raising the 
              standard and volume of English, mathematics and sciences taught at 
              an earlier age; significant benefits will accrue with Omanis 
              better equipped to enter the job market,&quot; asserts a local 
              education specialist.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Feeding the knowledge economy</b><br>
              Particular emphasis is being laid on providing IT skills. In the 
              medium term, planners will have to consider that Omani IT 
              professionals, programmers and computer technicians will be 
              competing in a very strong IT outsourcing market, dominated 
              currently by India, Russia and eastern Europe. Other Middle 
              Eastern countries, such as Jordan and Egypt, are also aiming for a 
              major slice of this sector. At this point, wage differentials 
              between Omanis and other nationalities become significant. Labour 
              costs are likely to form a large proportion of a competitive 
              tender. But projects like Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM) have 
              enabled Oman to break new ground in the technical education for 
              the New Economy (see OER April 2003 issue for a full report on KOM).
              <br>
              Women are expected to represent 10 per cent of the Omani workforce 
              by 2010. Their role must not be under-estimated in making the 
              Omanisation process a success. The fact that many more women are 
              entering the workplace is a boost. While some sectors remain 
              underrepresented, female trainees and scholars are showing a 
              positive interest in the IT sector (see table left) which is 
              widely considered as a culturally acceptable profession along with 
              banking, business management, and careers in social service 
              sectors such as health and education.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Omanis in the private sector</b><br>
              The numbers of Omani workers in the private sector are increasing. 
              Over 67,000 Omanis were registered with the Public Authority for 
              Social Insurance at the end of March 2003, an increase of 2 per 
              cent from the registered number at the end of 2002 although such 
              data does not necessarily represent the total number of Omanis 
              working in the private sector. In the same period, the number of 
              expatriate employees also increased by 6,620 to 554,097, a rise of 
              slightly over 1 per cent. <br>
              The number of expatriate workers in clerical and sales occupations 
              diminished slightly. Otherwise, the number of expats grew 
              marginally in administration, management, human resources, 
              engineering, agriculture, industrial and scientific work and 
              perhaps most surprising of all, service roles.<br>
              Why are employers continuing to take on more expatriates than 
              Omanis even when the government has openly declared a policy of 
              preference towards companies that have positive Omanisation 
              policies? <br>
              Private sector expatriate staff have revealed a tendency, for 
              linguistic or cultural reasons, to favour their own nationals over 
              Omanis when hiring new workers, according to the World Bank. There 
              are several ways of looking at this. Young people with 
              qualifications and training will become disillusioned if they are 
              put into roles in which there appears to be no career development.
              <br>
              Many young Omanis may not have been given a job in the first 
              place. Companies which feel that they are being pressured into 
              Omanisation may too easily assign roles to Omanis without 
              preparing their deployment within the firm.<br>
              It is also true that there simply are not enough professional or 
              technically qualified nationals to fill roles required to support 
              the economy. It is this skills gap that the government is striving 
              to close with new training programmes although professionals urge 
              the need for mentoring from expatriate experts to Omani juniors. 
              Young trainees do not become experts overnight. <br>
              Moreover, there is a deep-seated prejudice that academic 
              qualifications are valued more than vocational aptitude. This has 
              been identified as a key cause of skills shortages across many 
              sectors in other global economies. For example, the motor trade in 
              the UK is in very bad shape when it comes to finding skilled 
              labour. The government there has responded by giving 14-year-olds 
              the chance to drop certain academic sectors in order to learn a 
              skilled trade. <br>
              Such a policy would work in Oman. Certainly more linkage between 
              vocational training and education in Oman is needed as are better 
              bridges between educational institutions and training centres for 
              Omanisation, says Mohammed Bin Abdullah Al Mukhaini, Managing 
              Director of Al Rakaib Training Institute (see page 99).<br>
              There is no one solution to provide full employment or 
              nationalisation of all jobs in an economy. His Majesty Sultan 
              Qaboos' address to the Council of Ministers in 2001 urged Omanis 
              to take their own livelihoods into their hands, saying, &quot;Work is 
              no longer a personal hobby but it is indeed part and parcel of 
              worship, and therefore it should be performed with sincerity, 
              perfection and honour.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Breaking new ground</b><br>
              For Oman to move successfully to a knowledge economy, the 
              country's manpower resources need to support its economic vision. 
              For the Sultanate, economic diversification (as part of the 
              government's Vision 2020 plan) is the goal, Omanisation is the 
              issue, competence is the key, and training is the enabler. 
              Policies and planning frameworks should be relevant and 
              responsive, people should have the skills and learning 
              capabilities to add and create new value. Several initiatives (SANAD, 
              OPAL, the Youth Fund and Intilaaqah between pages 23 and 27) have 
              attained much success to drive the Omanisation process forward. 
              Employers are being asked to aggressively upgrade and retool their 
              workforce with the capabilities for the future. <br>
              &quot;Having a readily available local labour force, which is already 
              skilled and relevant, will be a major pulling factor for foreign 
              investors. Training Omanis with the latest technology and skills 
              is an investment in the future expansion of the economy,&quot; remarks 
              a local industry specialist.<br>
              Both the government and the private sector will need to play their 
              part to provide jobs so that every Omani can make a meaningful 
              contribution to the economy and enjoy a good standard of living. 
              The current workforce provides a good foundation for transition 
              but there is an urgent need to continue to nurture nationals with 
              the right skills and mindset.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Ask anyone even remotely associated 
            with the tourism industry, and he'll tell you that 2003 has been a 
            bad year. First it was the threat of a war and then the actual war 
            on Iraq that kept those contemplating a trip down to this part of 
            the world at bay. Then it was the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory 
            Syndrome) virus, which forced people into the confines and security 
            of their homes and home countries. <br>
            Couple that with the terror alerts and the unstable political and 
            economic conditions in various pockets of the world, and the results 
            don't seem very heartening from tourism's point of view. &quot;It all 
            began in 2001 on September 11, which had a disastrous impact on the 
            industry in terms of reduced traffic, increased cost of fuel and 
            insurance. Some airlines even disappeared from the scene. Then we 
            had wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. As if that wasn't enough, SARS 
            proved to be the icing on the cake. It couldn't have gone worse,&quot; 
            laments Abdul Rehman Al Busaidy, CEO of Oman Air, the Sultanate's 
            national air carrier.<br>
            On the face of it, then, the organisers of the annual Khareef 
            Salalah Festival, which enjoys immense popularity among gulf 
            residents, couldn't have asked for more opportune conditions. 
            Besides the fact that a lot of people had been postponing their 
            annual vacations for a couple of years because of the global 
            instability, the fact that Oman is one of the safest and the most 
            stable country in the region all added up in the favour of the 
            Festival. &quot;Security is a major factor in favour of the country. 
            People had frozen their travel budgets in the last two years, but 
            they are spending it this year,&quot; says Sayed Hassan, general manager, 
            Crowne Plaza Hotels Resorts, Salalah.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Facts &amp; figures</b><br>
            Ever since the Festival was first organised in 1995, the number of 
            tourists visiting the Dhofar region has been on the rise. 
            (Incidentally, this is the only region in the entire Gulf that 
            catches the monsoons.) For the uninitiated, the Festival lasts for 
            six weeks beginning mid-July. This year, the Festival was 
            inaugurated by HE Sheikh Suhail bin Mustahail Shimas, Minister of 
            Housing, Electricity and Water, on July 15.<br>
            With the private sector being given a major role in the Festival's 
            organisation and sponsorship in 1999, the total number of visitors 
            during the period July to September was nearly 114,000, an increase 
            of 26,000 on 1998. <br>
            A heartening trend witnessed that year was that apart from tourists 
            from the Gulf States (53,000), there were about 7,000 visitors from 
            Europe and Asia and 5,000 tourists of other nationalities (see box). 
            &quot;While most of the visitors are GCC state nationals, people of 
            different nationalities staying in these countries also frequent the 
            region during the season,&quot; maintains HE Abdullah Aqeel Ibrahim, 
            chairman of Dhofar Municipality, the body behind the organisation of 
            the Festival.<br>
            Although the final amount spent by the Festival organisers this year 
            is yet to be disclosed by the authorities, that figure is bound to 
            be higher than the last year's over RO1 million. Says HE Ibrahim: 
            &quot;Efforts are made every year to improve the Festival, and they 
            include the director of the Festival and his team visiting similar 
            festivals in the region to gain familiarity and experience so as to 
            evaluate and better promote the Festival.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            <b>The promotion</b><br>
            &quot;This year, Oman took part in the Dubai Festival for the promotion 
            of the Khareef Festival through participation in the Global Village. 
            Apart from coordination with the Directorate-General of Tourism of 
            the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry to promote the season in Salalah, 
            150 commercials regarding the Festival were aired on Arab satellite 
            channels in addition to 560 aired on Oman TV and 100 ads in the 
            local Press besides 30 in the Arab Press,&quot; confirms Hassan Salim Al 
            Dhahab, coordinator and director of the Festival Department of 
            Dhofar Municipality.<br>
            &quot;Preparations for the Festival begin early, and we have set up a 
            department specifically for the purpose of promoting and improving 
            the Festival. The functions of this department include completing 
            the formalities and procedures regarding the Festival as also to set 
            the agenda of the Festival,&quot; adds HE Ibrahim. &quot;This,&quot; he claims, &quot;is 
            vital as it gives the Municipality an opportunity to prepare and 
            organise the programme in a fine and refined way so as to attract 
            more people during the Festival.&quot;<br>
            Dhofar Municipality, on its part, has taken steps to improve the 
            Festival and ensure its success. &quot;There are two main factors,&quot; says 
            HE Ibrahim. &quot;First of all, the entertainment facilities within the 
            Municipal Centre, the main venue for the exhibition and other 
            activities related to the Festival, have been beefed up with stage 
            shows and other activities for children. The Heritage Village has 
            also been improved and the Municipality has also organised TV 
            programmes, shows and competitions.&quot;<br>
            &quot;On the other hand, we are conducting promotions of the Festival 
            through various marketing activities as also through different 
            media, including online promotions through the Festival's Website (www.khareefsal.com), 
            which provides a direct link between the participants and the 
            organisers. The Website also hosts competitions with rewards for the 
            participants,&quot; he adds. Indeed, the Festival included a number of 
            seminars, programmes and evenings as well as local and Arab 
            theatrical shows besides other entertainment activities and cultural 
            contests and games. <br>
            Moreover, the preparation for boosting the infrastructure of the 
            Festival Centre includes added beautification of the area to make it 
            attractive for the visitors with a lot of greenery and landscaping 
            thrown in for added effect besides improved lighting facilities. In 
            a departure from what has been the norm in the previous years, this 
            year, the organisers also concentrated on areas and activities 
            outside the main venue, informs HE Ibrahim. &quot;We have added 
            activities outside the centre, like the Global Village and the 
            traditional Al Hasan market, in order to reach areas where the 
            visitors are going to frequent,&quot; he adds.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The sponsors</b><br>
            In fact, with the private sector involved with the sponsorship of 
            the Festival (see box), the organisers are actively considering 
            including facilities and activities outside Salalah in the future. 
            &quot;The private sector has emerged as one of our main sources of 
            financial support - be it through sponsorship or activities to offer 
            more entertainment facilities to the visitors,&quot; acknowledges HE 
            Ibrahim. <br>
            &quot;Oman Air has pledged RO100,000 as sponsorship fees of the Khareef 
            Salalah Festival 2003, and we look at it as an investment and not as 
            an expense,&quot; confirms Oman Air's Busaidy. &quot;as a sponsor, Crowne 
            Plaza has pledged RO15,000 plus facilities as contributions towards 
            the Festival,&quot; adds Crowne Plaza's Hassan.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The turnout this year</b><br>
            This is a tricky one. While visitor turnout in Salalah during the 
            Khareef season was expected to hugely surpass last year's tally of 
            over 150,000 tourists, OER received mixed responses when business 
            and government authorities were quizzed on this. While the total 
            tally will, of course, be known later, it can be safely said that 
            the number will be more than that recorded the previous year.<br>
            For the record, though, the number of visitors to the region between 
            June 21 and July 21, 2003, stood at 42,548 compared to 25,943 during 
            the same period last year, an impressive 64 per cent rise. &quot;The 
            Festival has shown an impressive growth since its inception, and we 
            are maintaining that growth both in regards to the activities as 
            well as the area covered by the Festival,&quot; informs HE Ibrahim. 
            &quot;While it is the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry that maintains the 
            statistics of visitor arrivals, the number has definitely gone up 
            when compared to last year,&quot; he adds. <br>
            However, what is debatable is whether the number has gone up by as 
            much as was expected. &quot;While we were, indeed, hoping that the 
            traffic of tourists will go up, but for us, the number has been 
            slightly less than expected. In fact, our hotel has witnessed an 8-9 
            per cent drop in traffic compared to last year,&quot; says Steven Van 
            Coppenolle, general manager of Hilton Salalah Resort. &quot;But it is 
            entirely possible that that decrease is because of an increase in 
            competition from residents vacating their villas to accommodate 
            tourists rather than due to a reduction in the total tourist 
            inflow,&quot; he is quick to point out.<br>
            On the other hand, the Crowne Plaza Hotels Resorts, which has 
            undergone a RO7 million renovation and a change of corporate 
            identity from Holiday Inn, claims a rise in traffic this year. Says 
            its GM Hassan: &quot;The tourist inflow this year is better than last 
            year. Even though our hotel isn't yet fully functional (a part of 
            Crowne Plaza's property was still under renovation when the author 
            went there in August), we have witnessed a 5-8 per cent rise in the 
            traffic this year as compared to last year.&quot;<br>
            Concurs Bennett Francis, general manager, Haffa House: &quot;Although the 
            season hasn't come out the way it used to (the rainfall this year 
            has been much less than the previous years), there is no drop in the 
            occupancy rates in our group of hotels (Haffa House Salalah, Homran 
            House and Samhram Tourist Resort) since we have a fixed clientele 
            which visits us every year.&quot; While lack of rains may have a bearing 
            on the final visitor turnout, but as Hilton's Coppenolle puts it, 
            &quot;Delayed rains may actually stretch the season and it could turn out 
            to be a blessing in disguise.&quot;<br>
            The visitor profile too seems to be undergoing a change. &quot;The 
            visitors are becoming more and more price-sensitive, and what we see 
            today are tourists on a shoe-string budget, which obviously has a 
            bearing on the hotels' revenue,&quot; says Haffa House's Francis.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The bottomline</b><br>
            Keeping this in perspective, it will not be an exaggeration to say 
            that the Khareef Salalah Festival contributes favourably to the 
            tourism industry of the Dhofar region in particular and of the 
            Sultanate in general. &quot;Really, the Festival plays a very vital and 
            essential economic role. First of all, it provides direct as well as 
            indirect job opportunities. Secondly, since it attracts a number of 
            visitors from within and also from outside the Sultanate, it 
            activates economic participation, resulting in increased consumption 
            and commercialisation of properties and rentals etc,&quot; insists HE 
            Ibrahim. Not to mention the boost that the local hotel industry gets 
            from the huge number of visitors thronging the region for the 
            duration of the Festival. <br>
            &quot;The private sector has a very positive and complementary role to 
            play in boosting tourism in the region,&quot; says Hilton Salalah's 
            Coppenolle. &quot;We have an excellent product in Salalah, and it makes 
            perfect business sense to adequately market this product,&quot; he adds. 
            &quot;The government sector and the local authority have done their best. 
            Now, it's up to the private sector to do their bit. They have to go 
            out and contribute in the promotion,&quot; insists Crowne Plaza's Hassan.<br>
            To be fair, the private sector too is now realising the potential 
            that the region has and is throwing its weight behind it. Not only 
            is it actively participating in the sponsorship and other activities 
            concerning the Festival, some companies are even looking beyond just 
            the Khareef season. Take for instance Muscat Aviation Services 
            (MAS), a Muscat-based private company that has begun commercial air 
            charter operations from Dubai to Salalah twice a week from August 13 
            this year. <br>
            Unlike the other airlines flying to Salalah from Saudi Arabia, 
            Kuwait and Abu Dhabi during the Khareef season, MAS has announced 
            yearlong connectivity. Says Abdullah Nasser Al Maskary, chief 
            executive, MAS: &quot;We are committed to promote Salalah as a major 
            tourism destination besides serving the requirements of business 
            travellers frequenting the city which has a major trans-shipment 
            container port. Direct connectivity between Salalah and Dubai is 
            expected to significantly boost tourism development in the 
            Sultanate.&quot;<br>
            That, indeed, makes perfect business sense too. Explains MAS' 
            Maskary: &quot;The government is actively pursuing a plan to set up a 
            free trade zone in Salalah, which will further necessitate air 
            connectivity.&quot; As Hilton's Coppenolle puts it, &quot;We should start 
            looking at Salalah and Dhofar as destinations throughout the year 
            and not just six weeks or two months a year.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            <b>Future focus</b><br>
            Salalah, as it would appear, is a location waiting to make that 
            quantum jump from being a six-week local tourist attraction to a 
            yearlong global destination for the business and leisure visitor. 
            For that to become a reality, however, a lot of ground needs to be 
            covered as far as infrastructure development and large-scale 
            marketing of the region are concerned. <br>
            &quot;There are no significant new attractions for the &quot;repeat&quot; tourist. 
            There also need to be better convenience services for the visitors,&quot; 
            says Ali Mahmoud Al-Rayes, general manager, Dhofar Hotel. Adds Haffa 
            House's Francis: &quot;If we are to maintain the present growth rates as 
            far as tourist inflow is concerned, Salalah needs to grow in all 
            aspects - bigger shopping malls, better and more restaurants with 
            bars, and more entertainment facilities.&quot; The authorities have 
            already taken a big step forward by improving the immigration 
            facilities that, according to Francis, are &quot;extremely good and 
            helpful.&quot;<br>
            &quot;We must convert the existing tourists into brand ambassadors who 
            can then help us attract more visitors year after year,&quot; adds 
            Coppenolle. Considering that a lot of tourists are repeat visitors, 
            that may happen sooner rather than later. All it may need is a 
            concerted awareness campaign by the authorities and local corporates. 
            &quot;The government and the private sector should hold joint marketing 
            campaigns to raise awareness about the region in general and the 
            Festival in particular,&quot; believes Coppenolle. That, in a nutshell, 
            will be the catalyst required to catapult Salalah onto the global 
            tourist map.</font></p>

Yamaha’s origin and heritage is in the musical instruments business. Since 
manufacturing its first organ more than a century ago, Yamaha has grown into the 
acknowledged leading maker of musical instruments in the world. Shigeru Hikida, 
Commercial Director, Yamaha Music Gulf FZE, aims to take his company to soaring 
heights in the Middle East. Mehre Alam caught up with him during his recent 
visit to Oman. Excerpts of the interview:</b><br>
<b><br>
<img border="0" src="passby.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">How 
big is the musical instruments market in the Middle East?</b><br>
The UAE, especially Dubai, continues to remain a big market for musical 
instruments business. But Dubai is known primarily for its huge re-exports 
trade. We are looking to set our feet firmly in a country like Oman, where 
people are very keen to pursue music education. The Omani government is very 
conscious of promoting its culture and music.<br>
<br>
For us, Oman has shown the way when it comes to developing and promoting 
institutional music education. So I think Oman offers us a very good environment 
for the business to grow. However, there are pockets in the Middle East where 
it’s still very difficult to nurture and promote the musical instruments 
business.<br>
<b><br>
Is your company planning to ink a super audio system project with the Omani 
government?</b><br>
The key components of our business are musical instrument, home audio and the 
professional audio system. It’s the professional audio system where we are 
looking to ink a deal with the government here. In the offing is a big project 
in super audio system installation. We are partnering Genetco (General Electric 
&amp; Trading Co. LLC), for the Omani project — a music hall, or some such kind of 
thing. <br>
<br>
Our digital mixing sound system is unique and has made its mark at international 
events like the Olympics opening and closing ceremonies.<br>
<b><br>
What’s special about this project?</b><br>
Oman, for the first time, will have a super audio system — the quality of which 
it is hitherto not used to. It is going to be a breakthrough technology as far 
as Oman is concerned. The same equipment that were used at the Athens Olympics 
as well as the recent FIFA World Cup will be — for the first time — paraded in 
Oman, and expected to become a part of events like Muscat Festival. Once the 
system comes in place, huge stadia can be serviced from within Oman itself.<br>
<br>
The kind of audio that Oman is used to so far is nowhere near world quality. But 
we know that Oman can afford this. The ministries in Oman can afford this. The 
state-of-the-art equipment will make a huge difference. Genetco is going to 
invest in this system on its own so that the authorities here can take notice, 
and feel the difference between what they have been using and what can be used; 
the quality that they are used to and the quality that can be had. For the 
amount that these institutions are paying, I think they deserve this kind of 
equipment.</font></p>

    very special market for us.</font></b></td>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Is it going to be a first in the Middle East?</b><br>
It will indeed be a first for Oman but not for the Middle East. Two broadcasting 
corporations in the Middle East are using this state-of-the-art equipment. One 
is LBCI (Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International, a leading Lebanese TV 
station, and the other is Future TV. In fact, the radio station in Beirut that 
was bombed in the recent attacks by Israel was using one of the best Yamaha 
products. <br>
<br>
As for Dubai, unfortunately, none of the broadcasting stations there are using 
our equipment. Dubai has lots of world-class skyscrapers -- but acoustically, 
the city is really not that tall! There are some nice halls with good view, but 
when it comes to acoustics, they all fall much short of world standards. In 
Oman, you have a few concert halls which are much better acoustically compared 
to Dubai.<br>
<b><br>
Which market in the Middle East do you plan to focus on?</b><br>
Ideally, we would like to expand throughout the Middle East — but Oman is one 
market which is quite conscious about quality acoustics. It’s the only country 
in this region that has a professional orchestra. From the point of view of 
business, Oman is indeed a very special market for us.<br>
<b><br>
Does Yamaha’s rate of growth in Oman justify your expectations?</b><br>
As far as Oman is concerned, Yamaha’s sales (from 2004) have gone up by about 60 
per cent in 2005 and are about to register another 50 per cent jump in 2006. We 
are practically aiming at another 50 per cent jump in 2007. So the rate of 
growth of business for Yamaha has been approximately between 50 and 60 per cent 
during the last three years.<br>
<b><br>
Which are the sectors that have witnessed a greater demand for Yamaha products?</b><br>
It has been an overall growth. Every segment of our business has grown. 
Institutional sale has gone up in 2006. We had not been doing much business with 
the Omani institutions in the previous years. This year, for example, the Arabic 
keyboards have all come from Yamaha. In fact, we are supplying 600 of such 
keyboards to the institutions like schools. This has been a big breakthrough. We 
are also standardising equipment for use in classrooms as well as in 
professional studios.<br>
<b><br>
How big an impact the deal on super audio system is likely to make? </b><br>
If things really catch up we should grow by 100 per cent. But then that’s a 
dream. If you have just started and can still hit the tree, you should be very 
happy. <br>
<b><br>
What’s the vision for your company in the Middle East?</b><br>
We consider music as the common language of mankind. We would like to put 
emphasis on music education.</font></p>

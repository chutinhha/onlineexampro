        </font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>D</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana">iversifying 
        from the oil sector, the need to develop infrastructure facilities and 
        increasing fiscal pressures have changed the attitude of the Gulf 
        economies towards luring foreign direct investments (FDI).<br>
        <br>
        More investor-friendly attitudes and policies are on the agenda 
        throughout the region. This includes liberalisation measures, divestment 
        of state enterprises, the reduction of trade barriers, and deregulation. 
        Despite ample security risks, FDI inflows doubled from US$14.2 bn in 
        2004 to US$26.8 bn in 2005 in the Middle East region, illustrating how 
        keen the countries are to invest in this part of the world.<br>
        <br>
        According to a report World Investment Prospects: Boom or Backlash? 
        published by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Columbia Program on 
        International Investment (CPII), “high energy prices should maintain the 
        high levels of liquidity in the Gulf, and boost FDI from the Gulf states 
        into other parts of the region. Regional instability may not have much 
        impact on Gulf investors; it may result in a reallocation of regional 
        FDI, rather than a fall in the overall total coming from Gulf 
        investors.”<br>
        <br>
        In the Middle East, the UAE accounted for a large share (more than 50 
        per cent) of the regional FDI total in 2005, as well as the bulk of the 
        increase in regional investment inflows in 2005 compared to 2004. But 
        the report indicates that there could be a marginal drop in FDI inflows 
        to the UAE — from US$14.5billion to US$13 billion in 2006. It also 
        expects the FDI inflow to slow down further, to US$7.5 billion by 2010. 
        The other economies in the Gulf region are also not making any great 
        impact, says the report, with FDI inflows into the GCC countries likely 
        to increase just marginally.<br>
        Potential FDI inflows into the UAE, the region’s main FDI recipient, are 
        likely to remain strong in the short term, as high oil prices fuel a 
        regional economic boom. However, elements of the business environment 
        may hinder investment, the report adds.</font></p>

        <img border="0" src="table1.jpg" width="338" height="173"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="1" face="Verdana">Even though attracting 
        FDI has begun to assume importance in other Gulf States, many stumbling 
        blocks remain, the report points out. Some problems, such as the 
        relatively small size of individual markets and skill shortage in many 
        GCC states, will be difficult to resolve in the medium term. For 
        instance, a rapid expansion is placing increasing pressure on the 
        infrastructure, and the UAE is imposing employment quotas that force 
        firms to hire Emirate nationals.<br>
        Though the Gulf governments are moving towards more liberalisation, 
        there’s little impact on the scale of FDI in the GCC states. One 
        possible explanation for this could be the existence of alternative 
        destinations with more liberalised economies. The trend is not likely to 
        change much in the coming years.<br>
        <br>
        In their international ranking of 175 economies around the world, the 
        Doing Business 2007: How to Reform report, published recently by World 
        Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC), has found that the 
        Gulf states are not so business-friendly.<br>
        <br>
        The WB-IFC report ranks 175 economies on the basis of the “ease of doing 
        business” — having added 20 more economies in this report. The report 
        places Saudi Arabia at the 38th position, down three ranks from the 
        previous year. However, Saudi has been listed as the best Arab country 
        to do business. Other GCC states listed in the report include the UAE at 
        77 (down 9 ranks from the previous year), Oman 55 (down 3) and Kuwait 46 
        (down 6).</font></p>

        <img border="0" src="table2.jpg" width="338" height="173"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="1" face="Verdana">On the positive note, 
        the GCC states are making changes in their policies. For instance, Saudi 
        Arabia has simplified the process for registering a new company. The 
        changes have reduced business start-up time by almost a month (from 64 
        to 39 days). Similarly, Kuwait has made property registration process 
        easier by hiking the staff at the registry, and reduced the time to 
        transfer real estate titles from 75 to 55 days. </font></p>

        Bank-IFC Vice President for financial and private sector development and 
        IFC chief economist, says: “More progress is sorely needed. Middle 
        Eastern and North African countries would greatly benefit from new 
        enterprises and jobs, which can come with more business-friendly 
        regulations.”<br>
        <br>
        To attract more investments, experts say that the GCC states need to 
        make policies to create business-friendly climate — such as liberalising 
        the labour market, improving infrastructure, facilitating licensing and 
        documentation, eliminating hidden non-tariff barriers, and more 
        importantly, ensuring fair and equitable treatment of foreign 
        in-vestors, with limited restrictions.<br>

            and United Arab Emirates have adopted new Friday-Saturday weekend 
            structure from Septemeber 1. The switchover aims to bring the 
            countries in line with the working pattern of western countries. 
            While private institues and schools are yet to shift completely to 
            the new weekened regime, many private firms in the UAE are already 
            operating a Friday-Saturday weekend. The public sector and schools 
            have already adopeted the new structure.<br>
            Among the GCC countries, Qatar is already following the 
            Friday-Saturday weekend structure in official establishments. 
            However, a proposal was mooted recently in Qatar to shift the 
            weekend to Saturday and Sunday by aligning the weekend to the 
            international working week. <br>

            Salaries get bigger</b><br>
            The rising cost of living, driven by inflationary pressure in the 
            Gulf region and tightening of government localisation rules, 
            continued economic growth in India and the weak US dollar has pushed 
            up the base salaries in the region. According to a survey by Dubai 
            based GulfTalent.com, the rate of salary increases was accelerating 
            in the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait, but slowing sharply in Saudi Arabia, 
            Bahrain and Oman. Gulf-wide wage growth averaged 7.9 per cent over 
            the 12-month period to August 2006.<br>
            <br>
            Qatar registered the highest average increase in pay at 11.1 per 
            cent, followed by the UAE at 10.3 per cent. Kuwait stood at 8.0 per 
            cent, close to the regional average. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain had 
            below-average increases of 6.5 per cent and 6.4 per cent 
            respectively, while Oman experienced the lowest increase at 5.6 per 
            cent.<br>
            The sectors that are experiencing fast growth and skill shortage in 
            the region have registered highest pay increases. The largest pay 
            rise was observed in the construction sector at 12.8 per cent, 
            followed by banking at 8.2 per cent, and oil &amp; gas at 7.7 per cent. 
            Sectors with the lowest rises were healthcare and education, at 4.5 
            per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.<br>
            <br>
            The survey also indicated a clear shift in the salary structure 
            trends. Fewer companies are offering housing and transport, shifting 
            instead to a lump-sum cash payment. Performance-based variable pay 
            is assuming a bigger component of total pay packages, particularly 
            at the senior level. More companies are instituting formal pay 
            structures and annual salary review processes. Nationality-based pay 
            differentials still continue, but is narrowing. The UAE is probably 
            the only country where, in some cases, nationality-based pay 
            differences may be on the rise, driven by the government’s recent 
            push for Emiratisation of certain areas.<br>
            <br>
            Interestingly, more employers are considering female candidates for 
            positions that only a few years ago were considered the preserve of 
            men. The trend is particularly strong in Saudi Arabia, which has the 
            lowest female penetration in the workforce among GCC countries. A 
            female employee is preferred — not just because, on an average, 
            their cost is 10 per cent less than a male employee with similar 
            profile and performing a similar function — but also because 
            employers are now discovering that female employees provide them 
            with a strong competitive edge in serving the female segment of 
            their customer base.<br>
            <br>
            Governments across the Gulf continue tightening the rules on hiring 
            of expatriate workforce in the private sector. While the Saudi 
            market has long been subject to strict quotas, as have other Gulf 
            markets to a lesser degree, this year saw the relatively liberal UAE 
            market join the ranks — with the government beginning to impose and 
            enforce localisation targets for certain job functions in an effort 
            to eradicating unemployment among Emirati nationals. Given the 
            salary differential that exists between GCC nationals and 
            expatriates of similar profile, the increasing requirement to hire 
            more nationals is translating into higher average salaries and 
            increasing payroll costs for employers across the Gulf.<br>
            The upward pressure on compensations is expected to continue in the 
            future. However, it all will depend on what happens outside the 
            region — and the three prime factors are (a) the manufacturing boom 
            in China which has pushed up oil prices, (b) the economic growth 
            rate in India, and (c) the fate of the US dollar.</font></td>

        Dubai Financial Market (DFM) will soon float an Initial Public Offering

        per cent will be reserved for existing broker members, 25 per cent will 
        be given to government employees, 10 per cent will be offered to those 
        companies which are already listed on DFM. The remaining 55 per cent 
        will be offered to the public — open to all nationalities. Though the 
        exact pricing of its shares is not known, Essa Kazim, Director General 
        of DFM, indicated that the DFM shares would be valued at a price to

        other listed exchanges.<br>

        Bank is likely to manage the issue, and First Gulf Bank in Abu Dhabi

        December last year, His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,

        ordered the privatisation of DFM through an IPO.<br>
        <b><br>
        Inflation, cause for concern</b><br>
        Two contradicting viewpoints are expressed on the mounting inflation in 
        the UAE. Standard Chartered Bank, in its recent report, expects the 
        inflation to climb up to 13.8 per cent this year from 10.4 per cent in 
        2005 and fall to 9.6 per cent in 2007. However, the government is 
        confident that inflation will fall to 4 per cent by the next year.<br>
        <br>
        The real estate market is the crux of the issue, and expected to 
        determine the inflation trend..With many real estate units likely to be 
        delivered by the year-end in Dubai, and by end-2007 in Abu Dhabi, says 
        Sultan Bin Nasser Al Suwaidi, Governor of the UAE Central Bank, the 
        inflation rate is expected to go down by the end of this year — and by 
        end-2007 is likely to be around four per cent, compared to eight per 
        cent for 2005. “Monetary policy alone cannot address inflation, as it 
        needs to be coordinated with fiscal policy,” points out the UAE Central 
        Bank Governor.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, the Standard Chartered Bank report says the upward 
        spiral of rents in Abu Dhabi and Sharjah will further accelerate 
        inflation to 13.8 per cent this year. Rent increases will contribute 
        over 50 per cent to the overall inflation in the UAE, according to the 
        report. Even after the supply of new houses, inflation is going to 
        remain around 10 per cent. Inflation in the UAE will remain high, says 
        this report, though the dynamics within the UAE will change.<br>
        <b><br>
        Consumer protection Law</b><br>
        As a part of the drive to control inflation and protect consumer 
        interest, the UAE government has issued a new law which will greatly 
        enhance consumer rights over buying, exchanging and returning of goods. 
        A new department will be created and it will become fully functional by 
        end-2006, according to the UAE’s Ministry of Economy undersecretary 
        Abdullah Al Saleh.<br>
        <br>
        The department will keep a close watch on price rises, attempt to wipe 
        out monopolies, and receive consumer complaints via a new hotline. 
        Consumer Protection Society, which was earlier dealing with consumer 
        problems, may take a new form once the law comes into force.<br>

        Solid performance</b><br>
        Taking advantage of overall growth of the economy, the banking sector is 
        expanding its wings and growing fast in Saudi Arabia as it is among the 
        most profitable sector in the GCC — with the return on average assets 
        and return on average equity at 4 per cent and 33.1 per cent 
        respectively, as reported in 2005. With the demand for funds being 
        strong, thanks to the strong economic growth and the announcement of 
        massive infrastructure projects in different sectors, the banking 
        sector’s growth is expected to remain strong.<br>
        <br>
        Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), Saudi Arabia’s financial 
        regulator, has been active in liberalising the sector and has issued 
        licenses to a number of GCC and foreign banks to operate in the Saudi 
        market. During 2002-05, the number of bank branches in the Kingdom 
        increased from 1,203 in 2002 to 1,251 in 2005. The number of ATMs grew 
        much faster — from 3,108 in 2002 to 4,576 in 2005. Alternative delivery 
        channels have gained importance to provide better services to customers 
        and, in turn, help banks reduce transaction cost — thereby enhancing 
        operational efficiency.<br>
        <br>
        The Global Investment House report says that the consolidated assets of 
        the banks under review grew substantially during 2002-05. Now, liberal 
        licensing by the authorities will help the banks to increase their 
        number of branches — and thus mobilise more deposits. The report 
        anticipates the earnings from core banking activities to drive Saudi 
        banking growth where consumer loans was the key driver of credit growth 
        during the last three years.<br>
        <br>
        Most banks in the Kingdom have launched Islamic banking products, either 
        through a separate Islamic window or a subsidiary. Islamic banking is 
        turning into a fast-developing, highly profitable banking product. Also, 
        the division between Islamic banks and conventional banks is reducing 
        fast — with many banks having a large chunk of their deposits as 
        non-interest bearing. In fact, the deposit growth of Islamic banks have 
        been higher than of the conventional banking sector.<br>

        Strong oil exports are expected to result in record current account 
        surplus of US$114 billion, the eighth surplus in a row. Even with 
        government spending likely to increase by 20 per cent over the 2005

        of the GDP. Foreign assets at the central bank will grow to around 
        US$224 billion, enough to provide budgetary support for years to come 
        and defend the currency’s peg to the dollar. Overall, the government

        projects are likely to continue well beyond 2006, the report says.<br>
        <br>
        The strong oil revenues will result in strong fiscal and trade surpluses 
        this year, says the report. In merchandise trade, the Kingdom typically 
        imports only about one third of the amount it exports. In 2005, 
        according to preliminary data from Samba, the Kingdom earned US$178 
        billion from exports. The report estimates that merchandise imports were 
        approximately US$54 billion. For 2006, it forecasts merchandise export 
        earnings of US$222 billion and imports of US$68 billion, with a 
        merchandise trade balance of US$154 billion. <br>
        <br>
        Saudi Arabia is truly experiencing a boom, having grown 13 per cent in 
        2003, 18 per cent in 2004, 23 per cent in 2005, and a likely 20 per cent 
        in 2006 -- in each case with about 1 per cent inflation. For 2006, the 
        Samba report forecasts a nominal GDP growth of 19.9 per cent and real 
        GDP growth of 5.84 per cent, both modest upward revisions from its 
        previous forecasts. The nominal GDP growth figure represents another 
        year of strong increases in oil revenues (up by a forecast 25 per cent), 
        along with strong growth in the private sector and government, the 
        report says. <br>
        <br>
        “This year is shaping up to be another record year for fiscal 
        performance, with the largest budget surplus in history likely again in 
        2006 on record revenues and spending and declining debt,” says the Samba 
        report. “There is little doubt that the government will outperform its 
        budget. Our forecast is that the government will end the year with a 
        surplus of US$66 billion,” the report adds.<br>
        <br>
        The pattern of government spending mirrors the nature of the boom so far 
        — driven by growth in government and Aramco spending, but not fully 
        reflective of the magnitude of the rise in oil revenues. <br>
        <br>
        Strong economic growth has helped the government reduce its debt from an 
        alarming 93 per cent of the GDP to 45 per cent of the GDP in 2005. The 
        study predicts that the government will use some of its surplus to 
        reduce the debt further in 2006 -- to 27 per cent of the 2006 GDP.<br>
        <br>
        Another major development in the first half of 2006 was the sharp 
        movement in stock markets. According to the report, although the stock 
        market rattled nerves in the first half of the current year, it should 
        not distract from the broader story of powerful economic performance. 
        The Saudi stock market remains at an early stage in its evolution and 
        faces a challenge in keeping up with the booming economy, rapidly 
        growing corporate finance activity, privatisation, entry into the market 
        of foreign and new domestic financial institutions, financial sector 
        restructuring, and the emergence of an almost universal ‘investor class’ 
        in Saudi Arabia over the past few years, the report says.<br>
        <br>
        A major attraction of the first half of 2006 was mega projects besides 
        the oil and stock market. About 37 major projects that are underway or 
        have a high likelihood of implementation over the next several years, 
        with a total value of over US$426 billion, represent the Saudi 
        government’s commitment to the country’s progress. Defence and security 
        projects as well as security purchases will account for 17 per cent of 
        the total projects.<br>

        Banks’ ratings upgraded</b><br>
        Moody’s Investors Services has raised the short-term foreign currency 
        deposit ratings of six Kuwaiti banks from Prime-2 to Prime-1. These 
        banks include Al-Ahli Bank of Kuwait (ABK), Bank of Kuwait and the 
        Middle East (BKME), Burgan Bank (BB), Commercial Bank of Kuwait (CBK), 
        Gulf Bank (GB) and Kuwait Finance House (KFH). The National Bank of 
        Kuwait (NBK) was already placed at P-1. The outlook on the long-term 
        foreign currency deposit ratings of the six banks (all of them A2) 
        remained positive, keeping pace with the positive outlook on the country 
        rating for Kuwait.<br>
        <br>
        Kuwait’s ceiling for long-term foreign currency bonds was also placed on 
        review for upgrade from its present AA3 position. The local currency 
        guideline operated by Moody’s regulates that the highest possible rating 
        is an AA2. Kuwait will thus potentially be upgraded to the highest 
        rating, alongside Qatar and the UAE.<br>
        <br>
        Focused structural reforms, smooth political transition, budget surplus 
        — coupled with high oil prices, and strengthening fiscal and external 
        positions — have all contributed to the positive performance of the 
        banking sector. <br>
        <b><br>
        <img border="0" src="kuwaita.jpg" width="200" height="176" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">Kuwait, US to frame FTA schedule</b><br>
        Kuwait and the United States have agreed to set up a timetable for 
        signing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The second meeting for the Trade 
        and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) held recently made progress on 
        a number of trade and economic issues, informed Kuwaiti Minister of 
        Commerce and Industry Falah Al-Hajri. The meeting focused on six 
        different issues — ranging from the investment and trade sector, the 
        government system on tax reform, bilateral tax agreement, ways of 
        dealing with economic reforms and related specific legislations, to 
        bilateral tax and investment protection — which will be enforced on 
        Kuwaiti investments in the US.<br>
        <br>
        Al-Hajri stressed that Kuwait was going strongly on reforms pertaining 
        to foreign investments. The government is framing legislations in this 
        regard — such as the issuance of foreign investment law which grants 
        customs exemptions of up to 10 years for foreign companies while 
        allowing projects ownership by 100 per cent for expatriates, in addition 
        to the new tax law which stipulates reduction of imposed taxes on 
        foreign companies from 55 per cent to 15 per cent. The law was presented 
        to the National Assembly for final approval. Al-Hajri also noted that 
        Kuwait had permitted foreign banks to operate in the country, besides 
        opening the insurance sector for foreign investment.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, the US exports to Kuwait are estimated at nearly US$ 1.9 
        billion, while Kuwait’s exports to the US are estimated at nearly US$ 
        4.2 billion. Thus, the deficit in the trade balance, estimated at US$ 
        2.3 billion, is in favor of Kuwait. <br>

        Bahrain<br>
        All-in-one financial services regulator</b><br>
        The Kingdom of Bahrain has put in place an agency sanctioned to regulate 
        the entire financial services sector. To be sure, the sector comprises 
        of banking, insurance and capital markets.<br>
        <br>
        Bahrain Central Bank (CBB) assumed its authority on 7 September 2006 — 
        replacing Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) that was set up in 1973. In 
        2002, the government expanded BMA’s responsibilities to include 
        insurance and capital markets (notably Bahrain Stock Exchange) besides 
        banking. The new CBB Law encompasses all the different segments of 
        financial services sector into a single document. Needless to say, CBB 
        has assumed all legal rights of BMA, including those of issuing currency 
        and notes.<br>
        Reflecting the significance of the institu<br>
        tion, CBB has a paid up capital of BD200m (US$529m), with an authorised 
        capital of BD500m. This is a sizeable amount for a small economy. 
        Bahrain’s GDP at constant prices, adjusted for inflation, was BD3.5bn 
        (US$9.3bn) in 2005.<br>
        <b><br>
        <img border="0" src="bahraina.jpg" width="200" height="181" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">Expanded scope</b><br>
        Aside from seeing the arrival of CBB, Bahrain’s banking industry 
        underwent another development in the third quarter of 2006. As of July, 
        the then BMA implemented a new framework for financial institutions 
        operating in the country on the basis of retail and wholesale banking. 
        As such, the very concept of offshore banking units (OBUs) was scrapped. 
        Instead, former OBUs were asked to seek licenses based on the nature of 
        their banking activities, allowing them to combine various elements 
        concurrently. Technology and globalisation had rendered the notion of 
        offshore banking obsolete. <br>
        <br>
        The change fits the country’s overall strategy of strengthening the role 
        of financial services sector into the local economy, and for good 
        reasons. In fact, the sector is the leading contributor to Bahrain’s 
        GDP. It was worth BD966m (US$2.5 bn), thereby accounting to nearly 28 
        per cent of the GDP (in constant terms) in 2005. This is a record, and 
        represents a hefty 17 per cent growth vis-à-vis the 2004 figures. <br>
        <b><br>
        Critical charges </b><br>
        While welcoming the establishment of CBB, critics have questioned the 
        timing of the new institution. In the next few years, Bahrain might have 
        to give up central banking authority to a GCC-wide structure. If all 
        goes according to plan, the six-nation grouping is scheduled to form a 
        unified monetary policy — culminating into a single currency by 2010. 
        Accordingly, a new pan-GCC central banking authority would come into 
        existence.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, some critics are not pleased with lack of full 
        independence to the CBB. The law stipulates that CBB is responsible 
        before a cabinet minister. Accordingly, CBB officials are not completely 
        independent with respect to making decisions regarding setting of 
        interest rates and supervision, as well as permits. In any case, CBB 
        does not enjoy the privilege of influencing interest rates by virtue of 
        the Bahraini dinar being pegged to the US dollar.<br>
        <br>
        Clearly, by setting up a new central banking authority and changing 
        framework of licenses, Bahrain is determined to protect its reputation 
        as the primary banking hub of the region. Undoubtedly, Bahrain is 
        encountering rivalry from Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) 
        and other new financial centres in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. However, it 
        is the US$2bn DIFC that is posing the most immediate serious threat to 
        Bahrain’s position as the premier base for financial services in the 
        region. <br>
        <br>
        Only time will tell whether setting up of a new central banking 
        authority in Bahrain without full independence was the right move in the 
        face of growing competition in the region.<br>

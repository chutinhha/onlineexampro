<b>The infrastructure development giant, Carillion Alawi LLC, is strengthening

T</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">he smile on the cheery face of David J. 
Skinner has become much broader in the last few months. Gone are the days of 
uncertainty for him. With Oman’s economy in a buoyant phase, he is busy 
marshalling his 1850-plus workforce in managing more than a dozen projects 
spread across the Sultanate of Oman. As the regional manager of Carillion Alawi 
LLC (earlier known as Tarmac Alawi LLC), responsible for the company’s business 
in Oman, he is keeping the shareholders more than happy with contracts worth 
RO30 million in the company’s kitty.<br>
<br>
Business is expanding for Carillion Alawi LLC, the joint ownership company of 
Alawi Enterprises LLC (founded by late Qais bin Abdul Munim Al-Zawawi, Deputy 
Prime Minister of Oman) with 51 per cent stake — and rest of the 49 per cent in 
the hands of UK-based Carillion plc (annual sales of around US$7 billion and 
over 40,000 employees globally). <br>
<b><br>
Partner in progress</b><br>
Established in 1979, Carillion Alawi has managed major projects in Oman as a 
building, civil engineering, mechanical and electrical contractor. Skinner, in 
his second innings with the company since 2000 (first stint was between 
1992-1998), recalls, “Earlier, there used to be very few major infrastructure 
development projects in the Sultanate. But the scenario has changed dramatically 
in the last few years, especially in 2005-2006, with a number of multi-million 
Riyal projects coming up in different parts of Oman.” <br>
<br>
Talking about the company’s contribution towards Oman’s development, he says: 
“Despite lean phases of business, we have stuck to our commitment towards the 
country. And in the process, we have done some very prestigious projects such as 
Rusayl Power Station, Oman Cement Company Housing Complex, Fort Jalali-Muscat, 
Royal Hospital, Asma bint Qais Zawawi Mosque, Oman International Bank 
Headquarters, Salalah Container Terminal Project, Sultan Qaboos Port 
Development, Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, Muscat City Centre and multiple 
projects for Petroleum Development Oman, the Armed Forces and Government 
Ministries. All these activities have led to the development of infrastructure 
related to a wide range of industries to catalyse the economic and social 
development in Oman.”<br>
<b><br>
Beyond Muscat</b><br>
Though Carillion Alawi has undertaken many projects outside Muscat area, its 
focus has always been in and around Muscat. Skinner clarifies, “We have 
previously worked in Salalah (container terminal) and Sur (civil works for 
trains 1 and 2) besides other regions. Currently, we have contracts connected 
with highly prestigious projects such as Sohar Aluminium and Shadeed Iron &amp; 
Steel in Sohar. As a strategic policy we concentrate on the Muscat area, as our 
core strengths (resource support) are based here. We would like to go to far off 
location like Salalah, but preferably for large projects. There is difficulty in 
managing at that extra distance, for which we have to charge a premium, and that 
will make us less competitive compared to local contractors who can do the job 
with lower costs than us.” <br>
<br>
Business expansion beyond the Omani borders is ruled out for the company. 
Skinner admits that the company receives many queries for managing projects in 
other Gulf countries — but they are passed on as leads to Carillion plc in UK. 
In the GCC region, Carillion plc has a joint venture with Al-Futtaim in Dubai. 
However, the London-based headquarters is interested in spreading wings to other 
parts of the region — being currently under review.

“We follow the same management system as in operation in Carillion plc UK. We do 
make certain alterations to suit the local market conditions and environment, 
but generally the company here is managed as it is done in UK. We have a similar 
kind of control, structures and corporate governance norms etc. As head of Oman 
operations, I keep in touch and discuss business management related matters with 
Alawi Enterprises’ top management as well as Carillion plc’s senior managers in 
Dubai and London,” informs Skinner.

<b>People focus</b><br>
Carillion Alawi meets the legal requirement of 27.5 per cent Omanisation level 
in its workforce. The rest of the team is comprised of expatriates drawn 
primarily from India. With a couple of big projects in hand, the company is in 
the process of increasing its team strength by 25 per cent. It even plans to 
take its Omanisation level to 30 per cent. Isn’t it a big challenge for the 
company? “Not really,” says Skinner. <br>
<br>
“Most of our work doesn’t require long-term training. Many a times the training 
session, spanning over 3-6 months, is sufficient to do the job — which makes it 
easy for us to hire more Omanis. The challenge is maintaining productivity 
standards. We did find a problem earlier trying to integrate Omani workers into 
the teams comprising mainly expatriates. That worked with a moderate degree of 
success. We could see that it wasn’t the ideal solution to our problem. What we 
have done now is to comprise purely Omani teams under the guidance of our key 
members. It has worked very well, as the productivity of Omanis has gone up 
substantially. As a policy, we want Omanis to have good quality productive jobs 
— and we are ready to provide them with whatever support it requires. In terms 
of hiring, we keep in touch with government bodies to hire local Omani talent. 
We like to invest back in the country. Omanisation is the key, not for surviving 
but for thriving,” he says. <br>
<b><br>
Challenges ahead</b><br>
With reputed projects such as Muscat City Centre expansion, Seeb Airport 
Interchange, Deputy Prime Minister’s Office and new Sultan Centre at Al-Amerat — 
which are expected to keep Carillion Alawi busy not just in 2006 but for most of 
next year as well. Skinner is not worried on the business generation front. But 
that doesn’t make him complacent — as he says, “Unlike other businesses which 
follow annual growth cycles, in the contracting business we, at Carillion Alawi, 
follow a three-year business plan. So in 2006, I plan in advance on the business 
opportunities till 2009. Besides executing the ongoing jobs and arranging 
resources to start the new jobs in hand, we are submitting bids for tenders open 
now — and keeping close watch on new projects such as The Wave which are 
expected to announce their fresh tenders in the next few months.” <br>
<br>
However, a key area of concern for Carillion Alawi is safety standards. “We are 
very actively promoting the highest safety standards, targeting zero accident. 
We see no reason why the safety standards in Oman should be less than the safety 
standards on the sites in the UK,” says Skinner. The key elements that underpin 
the company’s health and safety policy include awareness, competence, compliance 
and excellence. <br>
<br>
“What we want to do is encourage clients and contractors to come on this journey 
of health and safety improvement. We need to demonstrate where we are going on 
this journey, share with them some of the ideas we have and how they can help to 
support these ideas — and deliver the ultimate in zero accidents in health, 
safety and environment,” informs Charles Yates, group safety coordinator at 
Carillion Alawi.</font></p>

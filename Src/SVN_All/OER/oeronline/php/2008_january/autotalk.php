        <b>The Maserati GranTurismo is already a big hit with the entire 
        production run for 2007 sold out. We found it perform true to its 
        promises </b><br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="auto.jpg" width="350" height="231" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Introduced at the 2007 Geneva Motorshow and launched locally in 
        November, the Maserati GranTurismo is a car that will be talked about 
        for a long time to come, a fact that is evident in the excellent 
        reception it has received from car enthusiasts, to the extent that the 
        entire production run for 2007 was sold out as soon as the marketing 
        began. Recently, the company took some journalists to get a feel of the 
        muscular Maserati GranTurismo and test it on the roads of Oman. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Exterior</b><br>
        The new Maserati GranTurismo makes use of the experience that the 
        company gained with the Quattroporte in the luxury model segment, 
        interpreting in an absolutely unique manner the concepts that had made 
        the Quattroporte the success it was. <br>
        <br>
        Inspired by the forms of the Birdcage 75th, the exterior appears 
        muscular with a natural and decisive fluidity of volumes, which start 
        from the impressive grille and mark out the whole side up to the rear 
        lights; the fenders hang over the large wheels to create a powerful and 
        elegant form drawn tightly over the mechanics. A large oval grille with 
        the trident at the centre, blended with a sleek and sinuous car body, 
        supported by robust fenders exude the strength and elegance of the 
        GranTurismo. The proportions of the GranTurismo grab attention 
        immediately and beg you to discover in detail the innovative and 
        traditional features that Pininfarina, in a classic example of Italian 
        style, has managed to combine with cutting-edge research. <br>
        <br>
        The merit is of the architecture on which it is developed, derived 
        directly from the Quattroporte sedan but suitably modified to mirror the 
        ‘GT’ theme, with a sporty look adapted for a luxury product. The 
        dashboard (at the centre of which is framed the inevitable analogue 
        clock, as befits tradition) has a fluid form, raised more at the centre 
        and snug on the sides, due to the chrome inlay fitted not only on the 
        door panels, but also on the rear side panels. <br>
        <br>
        The new bearing body design boasts a construction with a mix of 
        materials and technologies for weight optimisation: the structural part 
        is made of steel, the bonnet and bumper front from reinforced aluminium, 
        whilst the boot is constructed with thermosetting plastic material 
        (Sheet Moulding Compound [SMC] technology). <br>
        <br>
        The boot consists of a single skin that incorporates the aerodynamic 
        lip; the SMC technology not only keeps the component weight down and is 
        more resistant to damage and corrosion, it also has left the designer 
        more room to apply his creative flair.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
        <img border="0" src="auto1.jpg" width="350" height="151" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Interior</b><br>
        The Maserati GranTurismo guarantees all four passengers the maximum 
        comfort, thanks to the spaciousness, which is more than what is the 
        average for the segment. <br>
        <br>
        Usually, in such cars, it is the comfort of the rear passengers that is 
        the first to suffer when new features are added on. But, on the Maserati 
        GranTurismo, the sleek sporty style combines perfectly with the generous 
        and superior proportions, comforting the rear passengers with a centre 
        pull-up armrest and two climate control vents.<br>
        <br>
        Movement of both front seats is fully electric, with adjustable lumbar 
        support on the driver’s seat. A sports configuration has been chosen and 
        the seatback guarantees a high level of comfort even as it supports the 
        top half of the body and legs when negotiating bends at top speeds. <br>
        <br>
        Everyday enjoyment also means having a sufficient number of storage 
        compartments: for smaller items and the driver and passenger seats have 
        pockets in their door panels and a convenient day receptacle located 
        next to the gear lever. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Engine</b><br>
        The heart of the Maserati GranTurismo is the 4,244 cc V8, which belongs 
        to the new generation of Maserati power units, having been designed at 
        the start of 2007 for the Maserati Quattroporte’s automatic gearbox 
        versions.<br>
        <br>
        The basic technical options for these new engines have been designed to 
        ensure high specific power and rapid rise and fall in engine revs 
        typical of competition engines, but with particular attention to fuel 
        consumption, smooth running and silent operation. <br>
        <br>
        The V8 adopted for the Maserati GranTurismo has been fine-tuned when 
        compared to the engine fitted on the Quattroporte’s automatic versions 
        in order to enhance its responsiveness to the throttle controls. In this 
        configuration, it delivers the maximum power of 405hp at 7,100 revs and 
        maximum torque of 460Nm at 4,750 revs, of which 75 per cent is already 
        available at 2,500 revs. <br>
        <br>
        Compact and light (180Kg), the short stroke engine incorporates a 
        crankcase and cylinder heads (with head cover in Maserati Blue) made of 
        aluminium silicon alloy. The timing has twin chain-driven overhead 
        camshafts per bank; four valves per cylinder controlled by hydraulic 
        caps.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Drive</b><br>
        <img border="0" src="auto3.jpg" width="250" height="167" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The high rigidity valves allow the suspensions to work with excellent 
        precision to the benefit of dynamic handling, whilst also reducing 
        vibration and unwanted movements of the internal components. This 
        optimises on-board comfort over any road surface condition. The frame of 
        the Maserati GranTurismo derives from the Quattroporte, with reduced 
        wheelbase and rear overhang. What makes the Maserati GranTurismo such 
        fun to drive, responsive to commands and safe in every driving condition 
        is a balanced weight distribution with a slightly greater load on the 
        rear axle. <br>
        <br>
        This lay-out, which has been achieved by moving the engine back behind 
        the front axle, translates into uncomplicated and predictable 
        performance which makes everyday driving so easy, maximises traction 
        when accelerating (particularly on low grip surfaces) and road holding 
        (lateral acceleration 1g). It also results in exceptionally stable and 
        balanced car performance even during emergency manoeuvres. <br>
        <br>
        Steering responsiveness and precision also contribute to driving 
        pleasure, comfort and safety, as well as to the sensation felt by the 
        driver. The electronic servo-system ensures that the power steering 
        action is always related to driving speed, so that there is always the 
        right sensation when driving at high speeds and a light and comfortable 
        feel when manoeuvring. The chassis of the Maserati GranTurismo features 
        front and rear wishbone suspensions with forged aluminium hubs and arms 
        in order to ensure a reduction in the unhung masses. <br>
        <br>
        For anyone unwilling to make compromises, the Maserati GranTurismo may 
        be fitted on request with aluminium gas dampers, which use the Skyhook 
        system for automatic continuous damping control, and thus ensure that 
        any surface unevenness is absorbed and the highest level of comfort 
        guaranteed without penalising performance and sportiness.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Summary</b><br>
        The GranTurismo is suitable for everyday use, with excellent handling, a 
        very sporty feel and a thrilling drive. It is also a car, which pays 
        attention to comfort, materials, details, with large interior space and 
        a capacity of up to four adult people, which is greater than the average 
        for the segment. </font></p></td>

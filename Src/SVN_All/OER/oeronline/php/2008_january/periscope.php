<b>The Wall Street credit crunch and the unwinding of leverage on carry trades 
may end the appreciation of emerging markets’ currencies <br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="peri.jpg" width="142" height="201" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The past five years have seen an unprecedented rise in capital inflows in the 
emerging markets. The commodities boom, cross-border speculative capital, forex 
deregulation, carry trades and the liquidity boom have all enabled emerging 
markets currencies, bank deposits and local bonds to become highly profitable 
investment vehicles for GCC investors. Yet, the Wall Street credit crunch may 
dampen the bullish sentiment and the unwinding of leverage on carry trades may 
end the synchronised appreciation of emerging markets’ currencies. There will 
therefore be both winning and losing EM currencies in 2008.<br>
<br>
<b>The Chinese Yuan</b><br>
In the Pacific Rim, the most critical international financial equation is the 
Chinese Yuan-US dollar cross trade. The Peoples Bank of China and the Politburo 
are engaged in a serious attempt to combat the inflation virus in the Middle 
Kingdom, having understood the lessons and ghastly implications of the June 1989 
Tiananmen Square massacre all too well. The PBOC hiked the reserve requirement 
ratio for Chinese banks for the tenth time to 14.5 per cent in December, its 
first 100 basis points hike in four years. Moreover, protectionist sentiments in 
the US Congress in an election year emphasise the need for a tighter monetary 
policy to arrest the asset bubble in the Shanghai A share market and Chinese 
real estate. An inflation surge caused by a rise in meat prices, bank credit 
growth and the removal of gasoline subsidies all make it imperative that the 
Peoples Bank will countenance a faster pace of Yuan appreciation in 2008. As the 
Chinese inflation rate surges to 7 per cent and GDP growth accelerates to 10 per 
cent in the endgame to the Beijing Olympics, it is quite possible that the 
Chinese Yuan will rise as high as 6.8 to the US dollar. <br>
<br>
The rise in the Chinese yuan, of course, will have a bullish impact on proxy 
currencies like the Singapore dollar and the South Korean Won, quite possibly 
the most undervalued currencies in Asia. Singapore has replaced Hong Kong as the 
private banking and wealth management hub of the Far East and booming 
construction, property, aviation, shipping, tourism and finance sectors have all 
led to a classic 8 per cent tiger economy growth rates. As inflation and real 
estate values rise in the Lion City, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) 
will allow the Singapore dollar to appreciate at a faster rate against its hard 
currency basket. This suggests that a 1.38-1.40 target for the Singapore dollar 
against the greenback by mid-2008 is not unrealistic.<br>
<br>
<b>The Philippines Peso</b><br>
Apart from the Chinese Yuan, the Philippines Peso is a classic candidate to rise 
against the US dollar. The Philippines Peso is the best performing currency 
against the US dollar, due to the US$15-billion surge in remittances, the 
macroeconomic success of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s fiscal policies, 
the anti-inflation policies of the Bangko Sentral Pilipinas (BSP), the momentum 
of privatisation in the embryonic call centre/BPO revolution and the wild bull 
run in the Manila stock market. I can envisage additional appreciation of the 
Philippine Peso to 40 as the foreign exchange market realises that President 
Arroyo will not be overthrown by rebel military officers and that Manila has 
signed a peace deal with Moro rebels in Mindanao, improving Philippine’s country 
risk.<br>
<br>
<b>The Indian Rupee</b><br>
The Reserve Bank of India has engineered a successive pre-emptive monetary 
tightening to combat rising inflation. Moreover, the Wall Street credit crunch 
and slowdown in the EU means a softer Indian macroeconomic growth, as bank 
credit declines from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. The RBI still believes that the 
balance of risk in India is higher inflation, not slower growth. So, I believe 
the Indian central bank will be loath to cut interest rates prematurely, meaning 
the interest rate differential will continue to support the Indian Rupee. From 
cellular subscriber growth to cement prices to tourism arrivals and the Sensex, 
India’s economic metrics are stellar. I believe the Indian Rupee will remain 
well bid against the dollar and trade in a relatively narrow range between 
41-38.<br>
<br>
<b>The Kuwaiti Dinar</b><br>
In the Arab world, I am bullish on the Kuwaiti Dinar, the only GCC state that 
has abandoned the dollar beg peg in favour of a currency basket. The Kuwaiti 
Dinar could well appreciate to 0.25 KD against the dollar by the year 2008 but 
is vulnerable to a fall in crude oil prices, a greenback rally against the Euro 
and Sterling, or any political issues between the government and Parliament, 
including on the acrimonious issues of foreign concessions on Project Kuwait.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Moroccan Dirham</b><br>
The Moroccan Dirham should appreciate against the US dollar, supported by FDI in 
real estate, textiles, offshoring services and tourism. However, Morocco is 
vulnerable to a slowdown in the Eurozone and pressures from exporters on the 
Bank Al Maghreb for a lower, more competitive exchange rate. Yet, I doubt if the 
Moroccan central bank will countenance a devaluation or an abandonment of the 
current managed float system because it would boost debt service cost on its 
external debt and the local inflation rate. The Moroccan Dirham has benefited 
strongly from its Euro-dominated FX basket and should be anchored by the high 
Euro-dollar FX rate.<br>
<br>
<b>The South African Rand</b><br>
The South African Rand has been a major beneficiary of Chinese demand for 
industrial metals, the surge in gold and platinum, the liquidity and risk 
appetites in emerging markets, high money market rates, a credible central bank 
and President Thabo Mbeki’s pro-business fiscal orthodoxy and support for FDI. 
Yet political, economic and financial storm clouds could trigger a depreciation 
of the South African Rand from its current level of 6.7 to as high as 7.8-8 
against the US dollar in the next 12 months. The leadership contest between 
Mbeki and Jacob Zuma for ANC party leadership could mean political instability 
and succession risk for the South African Presidency for the first time since 
the fall of the apartheid regime and Nelson Mandela’s election as the first 
black President. Zuma’s power base is in the townships, the trade unions and the 
South African Communist Party. Moreover, economic growth rates next year could 
well fall if gold and platinum prices decline, the agriculture drought deepens, 
the Reserve Bank’s monetary tightening and interest rate hikes have an impact on 
consumer spending. The South African consumer is dangerously overleveraged, with 
net household savings below zero. The trade deficit is 6 per cent of the GDP, 
making South Africa vulnerable to loss of international investor confidence and 
risk aversion. Politics, risk, the trade deficit, and gold prices are all 
flashing a bearish SOS on the South African Rand.<br>
<br>
<b>The Russian Rouble</b><br>
It is likely that the appreciation of the Russian Rouble will continue even 
after the March 2008 Presidential election. After all, inflation is over 12 per 
cent, far above the IMF target of 8 per cent. The central bank will rely on the 
Russian Rouble appreciation to offset inflation pressures as labour markets are 
the tightest since the fall of the USSR and gas markets are deregulated. With 
US$500 billion in hard currency reserves, Russia has emerged as one of the 
biggest creditors to the Euromarkets. Thus, the Rouble could well rise 6-8 per 
cent against its Euro and dollar basket next year. </font></p>

the award and test procedure was to single out the car with the most suitable

        chrome-clad aluminium wheels and a performance suspension. Dodge Nitro 
        is the first mid-size sport-utility vehicle for Dodge and complements 
        the brand’s current lineup of cars, minivans, trucks, commercial 
        vehicles and a full-size SUV. The five-passenger Nitro features bold, 
        aggressive styling, with performance to match. The bold styling and 
        masculine swagger of Dodge is hot-wired into Nitro making it more of a 
        ‘compact’ SUV. The Nitro suspension is engineered to suit the needs of 
        on-road drivers with a higher comfort level. It is available at Zubair’s 
        showrooms. <br>

        is perfectly true. Being functional, proud, and rough and tough as they 
        come, counts for plenty out there in the marketplace and it counted with 
        the judging panel. It’s excellent on the road; brutal and awesome off

<b>BAHRAIN <br>
</b>Phase of expansion</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>
<b>2007 saw the economy open up further to the private sector even as growth 
continued to be strong</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover8.jpg" width="206" height="317" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">If there is one key word to sum up Bahrain’s economic trajectory in 2007, it 
would surely have to be ‘openness’. With the move towards further privatisation 
of the country’s state services, along with a major drive to heighten 
transparency, ‘openness’ has become the major trend driver in the country. 
Accompanying this has also been a drive to boost an awareness of what is still 
out there in the oil and gas sectors, along with more open arms to the country’s 
neighbours, such as Qatar and Iran, via some significant infrastructure 
projects. <br>
<br>
The long-standing aim of tackling the challenge of unemployment by 
diversifying the economy into industry and financial services, while also 
helping more nationals get employment, has also been a theme throughout the 12 
months. Meanwhile, the island state has also been taking its place in the 
Gulf-wide debates over the future of the dollar peg and further Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) integration.<br>
<br>
Bahrain has long been an open economy, one that 
welcomes foreign investment. The Heritage Foundation made it the world’s 39th 
freest economy in 2007, or 2nd out of the 17 countries of the Middle East 
region. Almost zero tax is major a feature of the kingdom, although 2007 did see 
the introduction in June of a 1 per cent contribution by nationals to the state 
unemployment insurance scheme, with this also matched by employers. <br>
<br>
Economic 
growth has been strong in recent years too. Real GDP expansion was 7.8 per cent 
in 2005, although this has slowed since. Forecasts at the start of 2006 were of 
around 6 per cent and again for 2007 as well, although these have generally been 
revised upwards since. The IMF forecast higher growth for 2007, of around 6.9 
per cent, to a GDP of US$17.5 billion.<br>
<br>
<b>Energy sector</b><br>
Of course, much of what is driving this is high oil and gas prices, with 
petroleum making up 79.7 per cent of all revenue from exports in 2006, a figure 
likely to have remained similar in 2007, as oil prices crept towards US$100 a 
barrel. For the last few years, oil has contributed around a quarter of the 
country’s GDP. At the same time though, Bahrain itself is a major consumer of 
energy, with its oil imports amounting to around half the total import bill. 
Bahrain receives oil from Saudi Arabia too, which is refined in Bahrain before 
being re-exported. <br>
<br>
Gas too has become an increasingly key commodity, with 2007 
being an important year for the commodity. Bahrain needs plenty of gas to both 
help in its enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects and as a feedstock for power 
plants. While many GCC states have turned to Qatar in recent times to boost 
their gas inputs, and Bahrain is no exception. In fact, it first entered into a 
deal for Qatari gas in 2005, a deal that subsequently hit some choppier waters, 
with objections on routing of the gas from Saudi Arabia. While Bahraini 
officials express hope that a pipeline will one day be built, the kingdom has 
also been looking for other sources. In late 2007, they began discussions with 
Iran on an alternative gas pipeline that would come on stream in 2012, despite 
discomfort at the idea from the US. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Bahrain has been aggressively 
expanding its exploration and production activities, as well as pushing for 
greater use of EOR techniques for its existing fields. A number of new 
exploration agreements were signed during the year, with blocks going to 
international players. The first three quarters of 2007 saw total production hit 
50.4 million barrels, though it continued to reflect the historic downward 
trend. Yet, with the new investment, the expectation is that production will 
begin to rise again in the years ahead, with a 70,000 barrels per day target 
set. <br>
<br>
At the same time, the country has also been investing in the downstream 
sectors in an effort to boost the quality of its output. Bahraini crude has a 
high sulphur content at present, and so 2007 also saw the announcement of a new 
US$1.1 billion project to modernise its refinery assets. <br>
<br>
High oil prices have, 
of course, offset some of the loss in output by continuing to boost the 
hydrocarbon sector’s contribution to the economy. This has enabled a robust programme of public spending too. The year also saw a memorandum of 
understanding being signed on the Qatar-Bahrain causeway, one of the more high 
profile infrastructure schemes to arise out of the current oil price boom. The 
hope is that the causeway will also see a pipeline laid alongside, integrating 
the project with the stalled gas programme.<br>
<br>
<b>New concerns</b><br>
<img border="0" src="cover9.jpg" width="284" height="221" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The government has also been trying to tackle the problem of unemployment, with 
an energetic scheme to boost the education system. The campaign of 
Bahrainisation, which set quotas of nationals to be employed by different 
sectors, also saw some developments, with a December announcement that from 
mid-2008 there would be a reduction in quotas for certain industries. This was 
probably in response to difficulties in areas such as construction, where hiring 
locals had proved highly problematic. Addressing the high wage and conditions 
expectations of Bahrainis is likely to go on being tricky, however, in the face 
of pressure on business margins, as competition increases. <br>
<br>
This competitive 
level did increase dramatically during the year in another major area, the 
financial sector, which faced growing challenges from other Gulf states. With 
almost every member of the GCC now setting up or running its own financial 
centre, Bahrain’s traditional position as the Gulf’s banker is being challenged. 
One response has been the continuing development of Islamic finance in the 
kingdom, with a series of consolidatory moves taking place in this field – which 
Bahrain champions – during the year. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the economy as a whole continued 
to open up, with September seeing an announcement from Sheikh Mohammad bin Issa 
Al Khalifa, the chief executive of the Economic Development Board, that the 
sell-off programme will be stepped up. The post office and petrol stations are 
likely to be the first targets for this heightened campaign. <br>
<br>
Another key area of 
government policy in 2007 was of course the dollar peg, which has come under 
increasing pressure as the dollar depreciated and the US Federal Reserve moved 
to cut interest rates. This has left GCC countries, whose currencies are tied to 
the dollar, in a difficult position, as the economic boom in the region has 
caused quite contrary economic pressures to the ones the Fed is trying to tackle 
in the US. <br>
<br>
Bahrain, however, remains in favour of maintaining the peg, with the 
government announcing in December that it would stick with the dollar for the 
foreseeable future. <br>
<br>
Looking back then, 2007 has been a year in which some sound 
foundations have been laid down. Opening up more economic activity to the 
private sector should see some interesting bids next year, while the progress of 
the oil and gas sector will be keenly watched. With high oil prices set to 
continue too, a strong public spending element is likely to continue, although 
exacerbation of inflationary pressures by the declining dollar may cause some 
furrowed brows. Nonetheless, Bahrain looks set to continue to expand its 
economic base in 2008 – and on an increasingly competitive footing. </font></p>

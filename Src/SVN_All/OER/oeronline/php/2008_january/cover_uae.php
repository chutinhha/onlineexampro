<b>The economy’s size has doubled in the past five years, and many analysts expect 
it to double again within in the next five years.</b><br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="cover4.jpg" width="205" height="547" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>While the past few years have seen the rest of the world sit up and take notice 
of the Gulf countries, it is probably the UAE that is primarily responsible for 
such attention. Dubai’s seductive glamour and Abu Dhabi’s deep pockets are a 
hard combination to beat. <br>
<br>
The latest example of this international prestige came 
in November, when Abu Dhabi’s sovereign-wealth management arm announced a 
massive cash investment in Citibank, the world’s biggest financial-services 
provider. The deal with Citi showed that Abu Dhabi’s investment whizzes have 
muscles to flex; instead of buying shares in the banking empire, it negotiated a 
deal that is more lucrative than just buying shares. <br>
<br>
The UAE’s added prestige 
has made it the least dependent on oil among all its peers in the Gulf. Its 
economy has doubled in the past five years, and many analysts expect it to 
double again in the next five years. The coming year should see some specific 
accomplishments to push the country closer to a truly diversified economy: the 
development of increasingly sophisticated financial instruments, major 
privatisation sales, a long line of IPOs on the stock markets, and increased 
specialisation among the country’s seven emirates. Abu Dhabi has the oil; Dubai 
the growing international clout and markets. The smaller emirates, such as Ras 
al Khaimah and Sharjah, look set to capitalise on lower cost structures to carve 
out their own niches – as outsourcing locations for the back-office functions of 
Dubai’s and Abu Dhabi’s conglomerates and as affordable places to buy real 
estate. <br>
<br>
<b>Inflation tops concerns</b><br>
The risks are straightforward: a US recession could drive oil prices lower, 
therefore chopping government revenue, particularly in Abu Dhabi. The overheated 
real-estate sector could slump, leaving banks exposed to loan losses. Standard &amp; 
Poor’s, the global debt ratings company, has estimated that bailing out banks 
could force the UAE to take on liabilities that amount to a quarter of its GDP. 
<br>
<br>
Analysts also worry that growing inflation could crimp economic growth. Housing 
shortages could continue due to a lack of labour and supplies to build more. 
Some worry about a real-estate bubble, but that would be far off, if at all. 
<br>
<br>
Another concern, in the background now but perhaps significant in the future, is 
rising government debt. Domestic debt rose 11 per cent in 2007 after a 38 per 
cent surge in 2006. <br>
<br>
While that is one way to spin debt, analysts also note that 
debt as a percentage of the GDP was at a manageable 47 per cent in 2006. Another 
debt story is a very positive one: the Emirates’ central bank in November began 
selling certificates of deposit in dirhams, dollars and euros, and at interest 
rates that will establish a standardised cost of funds in the country. This will 
make it easier for local companies to borrow money because it establishes a 
yield curve – a graph showing the interest rates of bonds with the same credit 
quality but different maturity dates. The yield curve is useful to help set 
interest rates on commercial bonds and to predict economic trends such as 
business cycles of growth and retrenchment. A yield curve for the UAE would make 
it easier to invest in the country’s assets because it provides clarity about 
the future. <br>
<br>
The deposit certificates will also add to the number and 
sophistication of securities available on the bourses in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 
The move has been hailed by foreign banks such as the UK’s Standard Chartered 
Bank, who said it would aid Dubai’s quest to become an international financial 
centre and the country’s quest as a whole to lessen dependence on oil. <br>
<br>
Overall, 
the government figures seem encouraging. The current account is ballooning, a 
trend set to continue. It was at US$35.9 billion in 2006, and some forecasts see 
it expanding to US$56.6 billion by 2009, even with import spending growing at a 
rate around 7 per cent or 8 per cent. <br>
<br>
<b>Investment deals</b><br>
The international investment community is noticing these developments and 
applauding. Major money managers such as Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank 
and Morgan Stanley have all recently praised the investment environment in the 
UAE. Morgan Stanley recently launched a new “Frontier” index of developing 
market stocks. The presence of UAE shares will add index-based investors, who 
buy all the shares in a particular index to mimic its performance, to the Abu 
Dhabi and Dubai bourses. <br>
<br>
IPOs will serve as another attraction for outside 
investors, as they will for the larger GCC region. More than 80 IPOs are 
expected, with the bulk of them in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. One of the first, 
in January, could be Emirates Airlines, the largest Arab carrier. Media reports 
in late November had the company selling 20 to 30 per cent share to finance a 
US$60-billion fleet expansion plan. Emirates Chairman Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum 
would not confirm that timeline, but has told local media the company want to 
sell shares publicly. <br>
<br>
Privatisation looks to be a theme for 2008. The country’s 
leadership in late 2007 approved a plan to sell all electricity and water 
plants, which are now owned by the Federal Electricity and Water Authority. They 
supply utilities to parts of the Northern Emirates. A decision has not been made 
yet on whether the government would sell the plants in an IPO or through private 
sales. <br>
<br>
A key concern for Abu Dhabi will be the continued access its 
sovereign-wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has to world 
markets. It may be the largest such fund in the world, though its net worth is 
unknown. Estimates in late 2007 were a conservative US$200 billion to up to $900 
billion. That combination of size and the lack of transparency about the fund 
has some investors alarmed. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover5.jpg" width="300" height="246" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The deal with Citibank saw the ADIA sending US$7.5 
billion in cash to the bank for convertible securities. This means the bank will 
accept the money as a loan and pay an 11 per cent interest rate for three or 
four years. ADIA will then have the option to convert the investment into shares 
at a set price, which, if Citi’s operations stabilise, will certainly be below 
the stock price at that time. ADIA would then become the largest single 
shareholder in the company. The deal was welcomed in late November as a saviour 
for the struggling bank, but it did raise eyebrows among regulators. For the 
year, sovereign funds invested some US$37 billion in banks. Neither the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission nor the European Commission advocated acting 
to limit sovereign funds, but the regulators expressed a concern over their size 
and lack of disclosure habits. <br>
<br>
While ADIA’s profit does not end up padding the 
UAE’s budget, the added wealth cycles through the country and enriches it 
indirectly. If the EU or US were to limit ADIA’s access, it could shrink the 
fund’s growth potential. <br>
<br>
Overall, while the UAE could suffer a slight drop in 
demand for oil if the US economy struggles, internal developments are expected 
to more than compensate for that. The maturing financial market will continue to 
attract foreign money, along with IPOs and privatisations. That should help 
Dubai’s quest to establish itself as a global financial-services hub, and 
attract more capital to further diversify an economy that is not only growing 
but also branching out. </font></p>

<b>With over a decade of experience in supporting and advising both public and 
private sector clients as lead consultant in compliance to environmental impact 
studies and engineering solutions, HMR Consultants are a recognized leader in 
their field of practice <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="corp.jpg" width="250" height="279" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"></b>The significant development that Oman has made in the last few decades has 
been achieved as a result of rational planning and coordinated effort by 
relevant authorities. As Oman continues to implement its development blue print, 
it will no doubt be confronted with challenges in managing and mitigating the 
potential cultural and environmental impacts that would be associated with this 
progress. These challenges are not unique to Oman as other nations are also 
grappling with similar issues. <br>
<br>
Dr. Hussam Al Rawahy, managing director and principal consultant of HMR 
Consultants, maintains that “We need to accept that trade offs would need to be 
made in the process of implementing our development plans. However, the trade 
offs do not need to result in irreversible environmental impacts. I am a firm 
believer in the potential to develop acceptable solutions to mitigate the 
inevitable impact of any new development. We have tremendous leverage in 
applying innovative tools and technologies to address many of the negative 
impacts that may result from these new projects.” <br>
<br>
With over a decade of experience in supporting and advising both public and 
private sector clients as lead consultant in compliance to environmental impact 
studies and engineering solutions, HMR Consultants are a recognized leader in 
their field of practice. “This recognition has resulted from our commitment to 
our ethos of being client driven rather than commercially driven.” adds Dr. Al 
Rawahy. This can be attested by the impressive resume of the firm’s project 
profile. “We continuously strive to be consistent with the quality of our 
services and to maintaining high technical integrity throughout our practice.
<br>
<br>
We believe in taking ownership of our work and recognize the responsibilities 
associated with our license to practice.” Based in Muscat, HMR Consultants has 
been commissioned to support clients nationally, regionally and internationally. 
Registered with the World Bank and International Funding Cooperation (IFC), HMR 
Consultants have qualified for projects throughout the MENA (Middle East and 
North Africa) and continue to receive invitations to participate in global 
projects that require a consortium of professional service firms each one 
established in their specialist fields. “I always maintain that our milestone 
achievement has been our ability to break the glass ceiling of professional 
service and legitimately qualify as an active agent in the knowledge based 
economy”. It is clear that HMR are proud of their credo of being “an Omani based 
firm with international interests”.

With new offices recently established in Dubai and another soon to be 
commissioned in New Delhi, HMR Consultants aims to service their international 
clients with enhanced efficiency and knowledge. “We have recognized that our 
strategic location does afford us access and hence mobility to support our 
client catchment. We accomplish this while still being sensitive towards 
maintaining our cost centers without compromising the quality or integrity of 
our services.” <br>
<br>
Dr. Al Rawahy agrees that it is very tempting to oversubscribe resources in 
response to market requirements and potential commercial gains that could be 
realized. But HMR’s commitment to sustain their standards while still achieving 
their commercial targets is a priority that does require tight management and a 
focus on their core competency and resources. “There is a constant danger to 
dilute our standards and practice by responding to market trends, however, we 
strongly believe in adhering to industry best standards and practices. The real 
legacy of our work would be witnessed after the projects have been commissioned 
and the cumulative impacts of their footprint begin to arise.” <br>
<br>
HMR maintains a team of in-house technical expertise whose profile include 
talented Omani graduates who are developed and mentored to work as individual 
consultants or as part of a multi-disciplinary project team. The 
multidisciplinary nature of their practice demands that the firm recruit and 
maintain a wide range of in house skills and experiences. Technical expertise is 
hired from countries like South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, India and UK. “It 
is very important that we maintain an international profile of in house 
consultants. Each consultant brings in their experience and skills resulting in 
a healthy level of technology transfer and innovation. Ultimately our clients 
appreciate the value added knowledge base we offer.” <br>
<br>
The firm’s portfolio includes environmental impact assessments for major 
industrial and infrastructure projects, national water resource assessment 
studies, ground water and air quality monitoring, remediation projects, waste 
management, social impact and sustainability studies, corporate advisory 
service, environmental auditing and engineering services. <br>
<br>
HMR’s client list includes most of the major oil exploration and production 
companies as well as downstream developers such as Oman Oil, Oman Refinery, 
Sohar Industrial Port Company (SIPC) and Sohar Aluminium. Public sector 
organizations include the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs; Ministry 
of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of National Economy and Ministry of Tourism, 
etc. In the international arena, HMR has clients and projects in Yemen, Iran and 
more recently Iraq. <br>
<br>
HMR’s practice also includes assessment and advisory services to corporate 
entities that are keen to implement their Corporate Social Responsibilities 
(CSR). “This is an area of particular interest and activity for HMR and provides 
the opportunity to guide and direct corporate funding of civil aid projects and 
promoting social entrepreneurship. As FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) increases 
in response to Oman’s free market economy, there is a growing need to provide 
assessment that not only complies with Oman’s statutes but also complies with 
international guidelines. A good example of this is the increasing requirement 
that our international clients have is compliance to Equator Principals for 
lending and project funding,” says Dr. Al Rawahy. <br>
<br>
“We welcome these new standards and protocols which ensure a detailed analyses 
and reporting system throughout the project lifecycle, with the overriding theme 
of ensuring that the project is implemented and operated along very specific 
sustainable guidelines and practices,” says Dr. Al Rawahy. <br>
<br>
“There is no doubt a growing acceptance that environmental issues are 
transboundary in their impacts and hence the growing need for nations to comply 
with international convention and best practices. Green house gasses resulting 
in global climate change raise universal concerns and the impacts are being 
experienced by all nations. Oman and the region do have a vested interest in 
being active participants in understanding and defining measures to reduce 
emissions and adopt engineering standards that would protect against the 
potential impacts of climate change. <br>
<br>
“Again, it is important that we recognize that there are feasible and 
sustainable options that can be reviewed and adopted without compromising a 
nations’ economic development plans and strategies. HMR Consultants are active 
participants in national and international forums that promote thematic dialogue 
to support the exchange of ideas, technologies and policies that provide 
practical solutions that would not compromise the economic objectives of the 
project,” says Dr. Al Rawahy.

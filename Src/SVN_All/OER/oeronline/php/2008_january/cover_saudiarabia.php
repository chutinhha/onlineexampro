Saudi Arabia Going strong</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>While rising oil prices have benefited the Saudi Arabian economy and will 
continue to do so, economic growth may as well be driven by the non-oil sectors<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">With oil prices touching record highs, Saudi Arabia has reaped a financial 
windfall as the world’s top exporter. Petro-dollars have led to healthy budget 
surpluses for five years running and massive liquidity. Yet, even amidst bullish 
energy forecasts, many analysts believe the Kingdom’s economic future is found 
above the surface.<br>
<br>
What excites them the most, they say, is the emergence of the 
non-oil sector. “The year 2007 will be the year in which the dynamic of the 
current economic boom shifts from the oil sector to the non-oil private sector,” 
Brad Bourland, chief economist at Riyadh-based Jadwa Investments, said. His 
sentiment is supported by strong figures. In 2007, non-oil private sector growth 
was 5.9 per cent, outpacing overall real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent. Non-oil 
exports increased by 24.9 per cent to US$28.5 billion, in part due to rising 
international prices for petrochemicals and associated by-products. <br>
<br>
<b>Promising sectors<br>
</b>Manufacturing, finance, telecommunications and transport have been tapped as 
promising sectors. In manufacturing, predicted to be the fastest growing sector 
over the next few years, Sabic has three massive petrochemical projects with 
foreign and local partners in Yansab, Sharq and Kayan, set to commence 
production over 2008 and 2009. <br>
<br>
State-owned oil giant, Saudi Aramco, will enter 
the petrochemicals sector through the US$10-billion Petro-Rabigh complex, likely 
to come on stream in early 2009. Financial services are viewed as another 
promising field. In 2002, foreign banks were allowed to enter for the first 
time, and today 12 foreign banks have licences and 78 investment companies have 
been authorised by the Capital Market Authority. Analysts think foreign banks 
will perform best in several underserved business activities, such as investment 
banking, asset management and project financing. <br>
<br>
Islamic banking, housing 
finance and insurance are other activities with considerable upside. Meanwhile, 
investors have begun flocking back to the equity market following a sharp 
downturn in 2006, drawn by healthy corporate earnings and attractive valuations, 
which should positively impact financial services. Telecommunication and 
transport have received boosts from deregulation and investment craze. Three new 
fixed-line providers received licenses in the first half of 2007, breaking the 
monopoly of Saudi Telecom, and a third mobile license was also awarded. <br>
<br>
The 
construction boom will benefit the transport sector, which must move the huge 
volume of raw materials to construction sites. Other major rail, port and 
airport expansion projects are also ongoing. <br>
<br>
<b>Private sector growth</b><br>
<img border="0" src="cover3.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Sceptics doubt that the Kingdom is writing a new chapter in its economic 
history, but many analysts contend that the situation today is different from 
the oil boom a generation ago. They argue the pieces are in place to create 
sustainable private sector growth, pointing to several factors. First, the 
government launched a US$624-billion investment programme in infrastructure and 
industrial projects through 2020, to develop industries in which Saudi Arabia 
has a natural competitive advantage. These mega-projects include building six 
“economic cities”, an ambitious public-private partnership to create sustainable 
residential communities alongside industry. <br>
<br>
At the same time, government 
spending has stayed prudent. In 2007, the budget surplus was a comfortable 
US$47.6 billion. The bottom line was helped by higher-than-projected oil 
revenue, while spending grew by a modest 12.7 per cent. Moreover, the budget 
lays emphasis on education, a critical area sorely in need of improvement. The 
country has a young and fast-growing population, with many recent graduates who 
lack the skills demanded by the marketplace. <br>
<br>
“I think that the government is 
quite aware that education is one of the most important issues requiring to be 
addressed today,” John Sfakianakis, chief economist at SABB Bank in Riyadh said. 
“Look at the budgets of the Kingdom over the past few years and you will see 
very well that education has grown over the past few years, and will continue to 
grow.” <br>
<br>
Second, economic liberalisation that began as part of myriad measures 
undertaken during accession talks to the WTO, has fostered an investor-friendly 
climate. Negotiations culminated in December 2005 when Saudi Arabia became a 
member of the international trade body, which analysts think could further boost 
foreign investor confidence. Third, the Kingdom has implemented a series of 
pro-business reforms. A significant step was taken recently, for instance, to 
overhaul the judiciary system by forming separate commercial, labour and 
administrative courts. Under the current system, commercial disputes are sent to 
ordinary sharia courts, which experts say were ill trained to handle complex 
business cases. <br>
<br>
The results are beginning to show even if room for improvement 
still exists. Saudi Arabia jumped from 38 to 23 in the latest rankings of the 
annual World Bank’s ‘Doing Business Report’. “The evidence of the changes is 
pretty clear and manifest through many construction projects and growing skill 
shortages,” says Jadwa’s Bourland. <br>
<br>
“There has been a major improvement in the 
regulatory environment, though in some cases, practice is yet to catch up with 
policy,” Bourland adds. “Saudi receives by far the largest amount of foreign 
investment in the GCC, but there are definitely more things that could be done. 
In particular, tightening mechanisms for contract enforcement and streamlining 
the processes for closing a business.” <br>
<br>
Holding one-fifth of the world’s oil 
reserves and producing 11 per cent of world production, hydrocarbons will 
undoubtedly remain the economy’s bedrock. To cement that position, efforts are 
underway to modernise the country’s oil infrastructure. An additional US$80 
billion is being invested to expand oil capacity by 3.5 million barrels per day 
over its current output to 12.5 million bpd by 2009. <br>
<br>
On the back of high oil 
prices, Saudi Arabia has enjoyed five years of strong growth while slashing 
government debt. Real GDP growth in 2007 was the lowest since 2002, and compares 
with real growth of 4.3 per cent the previous year, which economists believe is 
due to a decline in oil output following an OPEC production cut in late-2006 and 
early-2007.<br>
<br>
<b>Domestic demand</b><br>
While the entire region may be awash in petro-dollars, an important difference 
exists between Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours, says Sfakianakis of SABB. 
“The (Saudi) boom is based on the growth in domestic demand, which is related to 
the size of the country’s economy, the largest in the Middle East and accounts 
for 51 per cent of the GCC economic output. The demand for instance we see in 
housing, is not due to the demand of expatriates who are coming into the 
country, but due to the growth of local demand, from the Saudis”. The flipside 
of growth has been rising consumer price inflation. Although inflation is 
significantly lower than other GCC countries, it reached a 12-year high in 2007 
and people say the price increases have been felt. <br>
<br>
Some economists stress the 
inflation is locally generated and not imported. Nonetheless, inflation concerns 
have fed into the debate over whether the riyal should be revalued or the dollar 
peg dropped altogether. However, Saudi monetary authorities insist the peg will 
continue and analysts believe the exchange rate peg will remain unchanged over 
the medium term. An issue casting a long shadow over Saudi Arabia’s future has 
been succession. But a degree of uncertainty was alleviated when King Abdullah 
issued regulations covering a new system of deciding the succession. The move 
was greeted warmly by most analysts, who acknowledge that political risk has 
been a factor undermining investment.<br>
<br>
In terms of the 2008 economic forecast, assessments are widely upbeat. Since 90 
per cent of total revenue is derived from oil, analysts expect high oil prices 
to continue generating large budgetary and current surpluses. Inflation, 
although still low by regional comparison, could remain above historical 
averages. But, on the whole, another year of strong performance is expected, 
particularly from the non-oil economy, which many believe will emerge as the 
main engine of economic growth.</font></p>

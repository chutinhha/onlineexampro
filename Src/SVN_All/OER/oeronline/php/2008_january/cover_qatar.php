<b>QATAR </b> <br>
Vying with Dubai<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<br>
<b>One of the fastest growing economies in the world, Qatar’s fortunes in 2008 will 
however in large part be tied to the energy industry. <br>
</b> <br>
<img border="0" src="cover6.jpg" width="174" height="327" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Qatar could turn out to be the world’s second fastest growing economy in 2008. 
Real GDP is forecast to grow between 9 per cent and 10 per cent for 2008, 
according to banking-industry forecasts. The only country expected to grow 
faster is China, at about 10 per cent. The UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait 
and Oman are also among the world’s 10 fastest growing economies, but barring 
the UAE, all are projected to grow at just half the rate of Qatar. The Emirates 
was seen expanding at a rate closer to 8 per cent. <br>
<br>
But investors know all this 
already and share prices on the Doha Stock Exchange reflect that knowledge: the 
average price-to-earnings ratio was 19 , second in the region only to Kuwait’s 
ratio of 20.2. That makes stocks in any other country in the GCC a better buy 
than Qatari or Kuwaiti ones, and is an indication that the stock market in Qatar 
may not see returns as explosive as what is likely in bourses in other countries 
in 2008. Still, shares on the Doha market are not too expensive. Stocks in 10 
other developing countries are costlier, including in China, Chile, India, 
Indonesia and Malaysia. <br>
<br>
Another challenge in 2008 will be rising project costs. 
Qatar has more than US$100 billion in projects underway in sectors, including 
real estate, industry, utilities and natural resources. Like in other Gulf 
countries, the cost of labour and supplies is on the rise, but the shortage of 
supply in areas like housing and office space mean developers are likely to keep 
building. Real estate prices will continue to rise, stoking inflation pressure 
on the economy as a whole.<br>
<br>
<b>Main driver</b><br>
Qatar’s fortunes in 2008 will in large part be tied to the energy industry. 
Analysts in late 2007 predicted that if oil prices drop in 2008, it would most 
likely be because of economic sluggishness in the US, where the credit industry 
is struggling to cope with delinquent loans. Still, many oil-industry watchers 
remain convinced that oil will remain above US$80 a barrel, a price at which 
Qatar will not have to worry about its budget and plans. <br>
<br>
Gas prices are less 
fluid than oil prices, given the lack of a global market for the commodity. Yet, 
demand is picking up around the world, specially in the US, and that will help 
Qatar. The International Energy Agency predicts demand growth of 1.5 million 
barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 1.7 per cent increase, and price rises of 
17 per cent. This is based on assumptions such as the expectation that North 
America will not experience two consecutive mild winters. Last season’s 
higher-than-normal temperatures sapped demand for energy to heat buildings. 
Qatar is the world’s biggest seller of liquefied natural gas. While the gas it 
sells now is mostly at predetermined prices, an increase in demand will 
certainly boost Qatar’s ability to negotiate higher prices in future deals. 
<br>
<br>
Several gas projects are expected to see progress in 2008, including the initial 
run of the largest LNG shipment scheme in the world – gas will be liquefied in 
Qatar and shipped to a hub in the UK, where it will be sold. This gas train was 
initially expected to start operations, and therefore to begin generating 
profits, in 2007. Now it looks likely to do so in the first quarter of 2008.<br>
<br>
<b>By the numbers</b><br>
<img border="0" src="cover7.jpg" width="300" height="222" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Qatar’s financial position is marked by strong macroeconomic indicators but a 
large debt. The government has financed gas exploration and production 
operations by borrowing. External debt was near US$26 billion in early 2007, 
about 48.7 per cent of the GDP. That ratio was at just 29.4 per cent in 1994, 
when debt obligations reached US$2.2 billion. <br>
<br>
The Ministry of Finance recently 
pledged to stay out of the world debt market, in part because high energy prices 
make it unnecessary. The government appears sensitive to and conscientious 
towards its debt obligations. It has been reluctant to take on more debt for 
fear of weakening its credit rating, and has repaid some loans earlier than 
required. <br>
<br>
This is happening as the cost of funds is increasing in Qatar also. 
The government’s decision to avoid floating new debt was perhaps also in part to 
keep the market clear for Qatar Petroleum and other main cash-cow companies. 
<br>
<br>
Anecdotal evidence shows that some of those industrial giants are backing off 
expansion plans until they can secure cheaper loans. Qatar Steel had planned a 
US$1.3-billion loan to refinance debt and add 1.4 million tonnes of annual 
capacity to a plant, but as of late 2007 it was undecided on whether to postpone 
that plan because of conditions in the credit market. The deal may be revisited 
in January or February. Qatar Fertiliser Co. is also said to be undecided on 
whether to cancel a US$1.2-billion bond issue. But as of late 2007, it had 
reportedly chosen to continue as planned so it can add capacity.<br>
<br>
<b>Takeover Battle</b><br>
Early 2008 could see the resolution of a takeover battle between Dubai and 
Qatar. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) had been vying with the Borse Dubai 
to take over OMX, the pan-Scandinavian stock market. QIA had amassed a 10 per 
cent stake in OMX by 2007, and had asked the Swedish regulators, who oversee the 
exchange, for permission to make an offer to all outstanding shareholders. Then 
Borse Dubai combined with the US-based National Association of Securities 
Dealers, operator of the tech-heavy NASDAQ electronic market, to make a 
counteroffer for OMX. That $4.9-billion deal was backed by major OMX 
shareholders and management. <br>
<br>
With the Qatar Financial Centre possibly competing 
with Dubai to attract multinational companies, the battle for the OMX was pitted 
by some as a test of whether Doha could muster the clout to challenge Dubai’s 
status as the premier financial services hub in the Gulf. As of late 2007, it 
appeared that QIA would withdraw its bid for the OMX, perhaps in exchange for a 
swap in which QIA’s minority ownership of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) would 
grow. If that plays out, as sources suggest it will, QIA would swap its OMX 
shares for some of Borse Dubai’s in the LSE. QIA would end up boosting its share 
of the UK bourse from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, while Borse Dubai’s stake in 
it would shrink to 15 per cent. <br>
<br>
Qatar’s attempt at becoming an international hub 
for financial services rests largely with the Qatar Financial Centre, an 
economic zone targeted at banks and other financial services providers. Tenants 
are promised low rent, a light regulatory regime and other enticements. The 
centre was established in 2005, but HSBC is the only big international 
name-brand tenant thus far. Qatar may lose out to Dubai in its bid to become the 
financial centre for the Gulf region, analysts say, because Dubai has been 
promoting its financial services sector for a longer period of time, and because 
regulations and investment controls are often considered more burdensome in 
Qatar than in Dubai. <br>
<br>
<b>Outlook</b><br>
While Qatar faces the same challenges as other Gulf countries – rising costs, 
the spectre of sagging energy prices, and an increasing reliance on debt – the 
outlook remains a bit more positive. Gas sales should boost coffers 
significantly in 2008, and the gradual easing of the regulatory framework may 
help coax more financial-services providers to set up shop in Doha.</font></p>

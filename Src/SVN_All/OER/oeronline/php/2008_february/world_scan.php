power grid</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="worldscan.jpg" align="right" hspace="9" vspace="6">‘Hackers almost turned out the lights in multiple cities after breaking into 
electrical utilities and demanding extortion payments before disrupting the 
power’. This is not the theme of a new science fiction movie but a real life 
happening if we go by the claims of a senior CIA analyst. All the break-ins 
occurred outside the US, said Tom Donahue, while not identifying the affected 
countries, or when the outages occurred or how long the outages lasted. He said 
they happened in “several regions outside the US. In at least one case, the 
disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities,” Donahue said in a 
statement. “We do not know who executed these attacks or why, but all involved 
intrusions through the Internet.”<br>
<br>
There has been “a huge increase in focused attacks on our national 
infrastructure networks” in the past year-and-a-half, “and they have been coming 
from outside the US,” stated the noted cyber security expert. The coordinated 
attacks came from foreign governments or militaries, not terrorist groups, he 
said. According to media reports, in late November, the security firm McAfee 
singled out China for risking a “Cyber Cold War” by probing other countries’ 
Internet security, including a Pentagon network and other Western government 
agencies. A few days later, the British government warned major banks and other 
financial institutions that Chinese military hackers had targeted their 
networks.<br>

hands for digital ads</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Advertising major Publicis Groupe and Google will jointly develop a unique 
approach to digital advertising that is both creative and technologically savvy. 
In a press statement, Maurice Levy of Publicis and Eric Schmidt of Google 
asserted that the collaboration gave them a “first-mover advantage” in combining 
the programming knowledge of Google with the creativity of advertising agencies. 
The resulting tools and business intelligence will not necessarily be 
proprietary to the two companies but can help propel the growth of digital 
advertising, they said.<br>
<br>
“It is possible that what emerges could drive the development of ‘open source 
advertising,’ if the tools were made widely available,” Schmidt said. Google, 
which makes much of its money by placing ads on particular web sites for other 
companies, promotes the adoption of common technical standards. Levy said 
current analytical methods were not enough to help agencies get to the right 
audiences on the Web, assess the effect of their ads and see a return on 
investment. The advertising on web sites and other digital media has been 
growing at a very fast pace compared to the traditional media such as television 
and print. This year, global online ad spending is expected to reach US$49.5 
billion, an increase of 22 per cent over last year, according to the research 
firm eMarketer.<br>

unavoidable</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="worldscan1.jpg" width="204" height="136" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="7">The International Monetary Fund says “significant” slowing in the pace of global 
economic growth during 2008 appears inevitable. It also stated that restoring 
world financial markets was going to be a complex and protracted task.<br>
<br>
According to IMF spokesman, Masood Ahmed, the US Federal Reserve’s 75 basis 
point cut in the federal funds interest rate on January – the largest cut in the 
benchmark rate in more than 23 years – was “appropriate and helpful”. The Fed’s 
move followed deep losses on world stock markets as investors worried about a 
possible US recession and whether the slowing US economy would drag the rest of 
the world with it. “The volatile weakening experienced in many equity markets 
during the past few days has underscored the burden that the current financial 
market turmoil represents for the global growth outlook,” Ahmed said. “Thus, a 
significant 2008 slowing down in the global expansion already appears inevitable 
and downside risks still predominate.” <br>
<br>
In its last global economic outlook in October, the IMF said world growth was 
expected to ease to 4.8 per cent in 2008 and it recently revised its 2007 
estimate to 4.7 per cent after new data on China and India. On January 10, the 
IMF had said that while it does not predict a recession in the US, it cautioned 
that risks of one had increased. Still, the IMF has remained somewhat upbeat 
about global growth prospects mainly because of still robust growth in emerging 
economies.<br>

failures in Asia-Pacific <br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">The Asia-Pacific region, excluding 
Japan, experienced record levels of failed mergers and acquisitions in 2007, 
stated Thomson Financial. The figure was as high as US$69.5 billion from 295 
busted deals. Australia accounted for 62.5 per cent of all withdrawn deals in 
the region. Withdrawn M&amp;A transactions have been steadily on the increase, 
reaching US$65 billion for the first time in 2006, up from US$27.9 billion in 
2005 and US$25.1 billion in 2004. Thomson Financial said it had already recorded 
US$10.1 billion worth of withdrawn deals in 2008 from just eight bids. That is 
almost twice the US$5.8 billion in deals completed so far this year, the 
researchers said.<br>
<br>
The biggest withdrawn deal in 2007 was an US$11-billion buyout bid for 
Australia’s Qantas Airway. The bid lapsed after the consortium failed to get 50 
per cent of shareholder acceptance for their offer. Similarly, in 2006, the 
biggest failed deal was the $14-billion bid for Australian retailer Coles Meyer 
Ltd by a private equity consortium, led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co KKR.UL. 
It failed after the Coles management rejected the consortium’s offer. So far, 
this year, the biggest busted deal has been the US$9 billion acquisition of 
Australia’s Orica. <br>

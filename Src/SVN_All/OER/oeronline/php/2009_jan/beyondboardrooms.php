            <img border="0" src="board.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="209">Madhursinh Jesrani is nursing a dream. And since his dream is 
            associated with cricket, he does not want to sit on the oars giving 
            complacency a chance. Come April, Madhursinh Jesrani – who is 
            incharge of Khimji’s watches division – and his boys will fly to 
            South Africa to play the qualifying matches for the upcoming World 
            Cup. Apparently, he has made it a point to visit the training camp 
            of Oman’s national cricket team at least once in a day. “A sixth 
            position will enable us to play ODIs (one day international’s) but 
            what we want is a place among the best four so that we can take part 
            in the World Cup in the subcontinent,” quips Jesrani, the manager of 
            Oman’s national team and one who has been a sports champion from his 
            school days at Shree Arya Kelvani Muscat Shala.<br>
            <br>
            <b>A childhood passion <br>
            </b>Ask him about his favourite players and the 58-year-old, who 
            jogs over five kilometers and visits the gym daily, says: “Of 
            course, Sachin is all-time great. It is pleasure to watch Kevin 
            Peterson, Flintoff and Ponting playing. However, when it comes to 
            style, I will go for Imran, Vivian Richards and Sunil Gavaskar.” 
            Jesrani is confident that Oman, which is ranked 18th by the 
            International Cricket Council, the governing body of world cricket, 
            will make it to the top four this time. Jesrani, has redrawn the 
            team’s strategy by appointing a native coach so that players feel 
            free at home.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Simple living<br>
            </b>
            <img border="0" src="board1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="197" height="169">Jesrani’s office timing starts at 9 am, though his day starts at 
            6 in the morning. Once in office, he gets busy with his work. He 
            sifts through the daily reports, contacts his high-profile clients, 
            including CEOs and royal family members, and heads for the gym in 
            the afternoon. In 1972, Madhursinh entered the family business after 
            finishing his college in Mumbai. While in India, he had a stint with 
            Sharda Ashram started by Mahatma Gandhi, which helped him inculcate 
            values of simplicity. “In 1972, I was looking after the general 
            stores of Khimji. By 1978, I moved to the watches division and the 
            Rolex watch I am wearing is as old as my association with the 
            division,” he says. As the years went by, Khimji’s added more luxury 
            brands, including Cartier, Bell and Ross, Orbita, Tudor, and Piaget 
            to its stable. “The customer preference is changing. To keep 
            floating one has to innovate.” He is also busy with the work of the 
            new outlet coming up in Qurum.<br>
            <br>
            <b>True to his roots<br>
            </b>A strict vegetarian by choice, Jesrani’s favourite food is 
            Gujarati dishes. However, he will fall for South Indian dishes at 
            any point of time. In case of western food, he goes for Italian 
            cuisine. Madhursinh Jesrani often goes to Switzerland for business 
            purposes. One of his daughters is staying in Mumbai and the other is 
            championing the cause of cricket in Oman.<br>
            <br>
            How was life in Oman during his childhood? “It was moving at a 
            snail’s pace. There were no cars and roads, for that matter. During 
            the summer, we were sleeping on roof tops. ACs were conspicuous by 
            their absence. Life was in a way a bit difficult.” Jesrani is happy 
            with the way Oman has developed and shaped up. His message to the 
            youth of Oman echoes this mood: “Keep up the way it is growing.” <br>

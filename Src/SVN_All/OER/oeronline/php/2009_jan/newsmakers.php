            <img border="0" src="newsmaker.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="188">In 2005, Jérôme Kerviel – who triggered the ongoing financial 
            scandal by pocketing $7.1bn – got what he had wished: the 
            opportunity to become a trader for Société Générale, France second 
            largest bank by market capitalisation. But a graduate degree from a 
            second-tier French business school did not ensure him a plum post. 
            Thus, his brief was to process and oversee transactions by traders 
            whose jobs were more glamorous and better-paid than his.<br>
            <br>
            But a determined Kerviel was desperate to break into trading. He 
            grabbed an opening on SocGen’s Delta One trading desk, which handled 
            low-risk futures hedging on European stock market indexes. Yet even 
            at Delta One, Kerviel could not come to the limelight due to his 
            lack of credentials. That frustration and the desire to play in the 
            big league led Kerviel to make unauthorised trades almost 
            immediately upon joining Delta One.<br>
            <br>
            On Thursday January 24, 2008, this 31-year-old opened a pandora’s 
            box in the world’s banking system. To save its skin, Société 
            Générale claimed that Kerviel had been hiding his tracks by making a 
            series of fictitious transactions, using dark arts learned during a 
            spell in middle management. But there were few takers for this 
            argument. The rogue trader is now charged with corruption and has 
            forced the bank to show the door to some of his senior colleagues.</font></p>

            <img border="0" src="newsmaker1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="235">Bernard Madoff had to take up the job of a lifeguard to earn money 
            to start his own securities firm. The $17.1bn that Madoff reported 
            to have managed in 2008 is all but gone. His admission that the 
            fraud could top $50bn looks plausible. The known victims grow longer 
            and more star-studded. Among them are big billionaires, including 
            Steven Spielberg; the owner of the New York Mets baseball team, Carl 
            Shapiro, a nonagenarian clothing magnate who may have lost $545mn; 
            wealthy retirees; and a cluster of Jewish charity trusts. Many 
            high-profile financial companies and banks were also caught napping, 
            including banks like Santander and HSBC, and Fairfield Greenwich, an 
            alternative-investment specialist that funnelled $7.5bn to Madoff.<br>
            <br>
            Though his modus operandi was similar to a hedge fund, he was, in 
            fact, managing client money in brokerage accounts within his firm. 
            He allegedly created a pyramid ponzi scheme in which existing 
            clients’ returns were topped up with money from new investors.<br>
            <br>
            Madoff’s pedigree was top-notch: a pioneering marketmaker, he had 
            headed Nasdaq, had given tips to the government on market issues and 
            was a well-known philanthropist. Madoff claims to have acted alone. 
            But given the huge paperwork required to keep his scam going, it 
            seems unlikely that no one knew about it.</font></p>

                <b>Oman Oil Marketing Company has set new benchmarks in the oil 
                retailing business in a short span of five years. Joseph Benny 
                reports<br>
                </b><br>
                <img border="0" src="oil.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="261">Since its inception in 2003, Oman Oil Marketing Company (OOMCO) 
                has seen a spectacular growth. Today, with over 100 filling 
                stations and more than 40 strategically-located quick shops, the 
                company has become a force to reckon with in the Sultanate’s 
                market. This remarkable growth has clearly reflected in the 
                bottomline of the company. In five years, the company’s annual 
                net profit has crossed the five-million rial mark and its total 
                assets have risen consistently since 2003. Looking back, Eng 
                Omar Ahmed Qatan, CEO, OOMCO says, “Our intimate understanding 
                of the local market coupled with the best international practice 
                has helped us to grow over the past five years. Of course the 
                Omanoil team is also a key strength, our team is made up of 
                highly competent and talented individuals who are up to any 
                challenge.” <br>
                <br>
                <b>Tapping new opportunities </b><br>
                Not one to sit on its laurels, OOMCO is planning a major 
                expansion of its filling stations and will set up new filling 
                stations where it is not currently present. Says Eng Qatan, 
                “Omanoil has a strategic plan to be the leader in petroleum 
                product retailing. Through the development of comprehensive 
                plans we aim to be innovative, trustworthy, friendly and a good 
                corporate citizen.” Along with retail expansion, the company 
                also plans to set up various other facilities like car wash and 
                convenient stores to complement these filling stations. This 
                way, the company wants to provide customers a ‘one-stop-shop’ 
                experience. <br>
                <br>
                The strategic importance of the company can be seen from the 
                fact that a number of leading entities in Oman, like LuLu, 
                Enhance, Khimji Ramdas and BankMuscat, have joined hands with 
                it. The company’s Basma Rewards programme -- pioneered in 
                association with Lulu and BankMuscat -- helps shoppers ‘save as 
                they spend.’ Its Ejaba card is used by the government and 
                private sector vehicles. <br>
                <br>
                OOMCO is the sole supplier of aviation gasoline 100 LL, which is 
                used in piston engine aircraft, in Oman. Besides, it markets 
                Castrol, BP and Omanoil branded lubricants in the Sultanate and 
                abroad. The company caters to different segments of the 
                lubricants market such as high street, commercial and 
                industrial, franchise workshops, rigs, transport companies and 
                the government sector. The lubricants are also sold at its 
                filling stations and complement Lube Plus, which is a quick lube 
                service attached to the filling stations. Moreover, the company 
                launched Omanoil-branded lubricants in the international market 
                in 2007. Omanoil lubricants are sold in Yemen, Iraq, Jordan and 
                Sudan and other countries in the Far East and Africa. The 
                company plans to enter other markets in the Middle East, Asia 
                and Africa soon.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <br>
                <b>Restructuring boost<br>
                </b>The company recently undertook a restructuring process which 
                resulted in more transparency between different divisions in the 
                company. The restructuring also created more opportunities for 
                its staff. “We strongly believe in flexibility and transparency 
                to get the maximum out of the staff. Empowerment is the key to 
                success. Furthermore, restructuring also allowed hiring of more 
                Omanis in senior positions to help achieve our current 85 per 
                cent Omanisation rate,” says Eng Qatan. <br>
                <br>
                The company has chalked out a comprehensive plan to remain 
                competitive in the market. The company is banking on quality, 
                innovation and value-added solution to achieve this goal. The 
                company has adopted a customer-oriented approach to meet the 
                needs of its customers. <br>
                <br>
                OOMCO has been a great champion of corporate social 
                responsibility (CSR) in Oman. According to the company, CSR has 
                always occupied an important place in its marketing plans. Says 
                Eng Qatan: “We are proud of being a role model with the best 
                interests of the Omani people and the nation as our guiding 
                principle. With a huge percentage of the Omani population under 
                the age of 18, we have consistently focused on youth to harness 
                our core values of being young and energetic.”<br>
                <br>
                Among the company’s CSR initiative is the Omanoil Football 
                School (OFS), which was formed in 2006 to enhance the soccer 
                skills of football enthusiasts. The school was formed in 
                association with Muscat Club and has over 240 participants. The 
                company has also entered into a pact with the ministry of sports 
                affairs to support its various activities such as sports 
                festivals and basketball. <br>
                <br>
                “Dar Al Atta’a has been a great partner to the company’s CSR 
                initiatives. We maintain the belief that ‘charity begins at 
                home’ and therefore we provide Dar Al Atta’a donation boxes at 
                our filling stations and convenience stores,” says Eng Qatan. In 
                Ramadan, the company sold vouchers at select Omanoil filling 
                stations and the proceeds were given to Dar Al Atta’a for 
                providing Iftar meals and Eid Al Fitr clothes for 
                underprivileged families.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Safety comes first<br>
                </b>When it comes to safety, the company has taken utmost care 
                to avoid accidents. It has achieved the rare distinction of 
                setting a 16 years of LTI-free (Loss Time Injury Free) record. 
                The company promotes a culture of safety and complies with all 
                government laws related to Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). 
                Everyone who works for the company is empowered to ‘think 
                safety’. The company was recently felicitated as the ‘Best 
                Distributor in the Middle East and North Africa region upholding 
                the highest health, safety and environment standards at a 
                conference organised by British Petroleum in Shanghai, China.
                <br>
                <br>
                The success of OOMCO is scripted by a well-trained, motivated 
                and innovative staff. Operating in an increasingly competitive 
                business environment, the company has continued its strong 
                performance focus and consistently achieved its safety, 
                operating and financial targets. </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><br>

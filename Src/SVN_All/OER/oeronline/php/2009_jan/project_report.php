                launched in 2003. Visvas Paul D Karra takes stock of the project<br>
                </b><br>
                <img border="0" src="golf1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="229">When the Royal Decree on freehold properties was announced in 
                2006, Muscat Hills Golf and Country Club was the first 
                integrated tourism complex to offer villas and apartments to 
                foreigners. Another first for Muscat Hills is that it is going 
                to be the first green golf course in the whole of Oman when a 
                part of its 18-hole, par 72, championship green golf course 
                opens for the public in March 2009. The project also got a brand 
                new identity – Muscat Hills – from the original Muscat Golf and 
                Country Club in 2008.<br>
                <br>
                When completed, the RO300mn Muscat Hills will basically comprise 
                an 18-hole par 72, championship green golf; an exclusive gated 
                residential development of villas and apartments; a boutique 
                resort hotel and a premiere Country Club in addition to 
                commercial real estate for office space, retail and 
                entertainment. The most spectacular component of this project by 
                far will be the championship golf course, considered to be the 
                only one of its kind in this region. Set against the dramatic 
                background of the Al Hajar mountains on one side and the Arabia 
                Sea on the opposite side, the topography of the course includes 
                an undulating vista of small hillocks, two large artificial 
                lakes, a number of smaller lakes and wadis among other hazards, 
                making it a golfer’s paradise.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <img border="0" src="project3.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="208" height="91">Muscat Hills, conceived as a golfing destination par excellence, 
                is the brainchild of His Highness Sayyid Kais bin Tarik Al Said 
                who is a passionate golfer himself. The project was announced in 
                2003 and then there were huge delays till it was relaunched with 
                a brand new identity in March 2008. There were also reports that 
                the buyers of the properties were asked to cough up extra money 
                than deemed by the contract. However all that happened in the 
                past and the way ahead is green and bright. There seems to be a 
                cheerful mood at Muscat Hills where work is going on in full 
                swing both for the residential blocks as well as the golf 
                course.<br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="project4.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="209" height="91">Chandra Lahiri, group managing director, Muscat Hills, who is 
                credited with turning around this project is confident that the 
                development is going on as per the new timelines, namely, 9 
                holes of the golf course to be ready by March 2009 and 
                residences to be handed over by November 2009. When asked about 
                the delays and the subsequent skepticism about the whole 
                project, Lahiri, says: “All we can say is, come and have a look 
                and see the evidence of what we are actually doing on the 
                ground.” According to Lahiri, Muscat Hills will be a landmark 
                real estate destination with its world class golf course and 
                some of the best residential properties.<br>
                <br>
                Lahiri is heading a team of professionals who are managing 
                various departments of the project and they include Craig Hanney, 
                golf course superintendent; Mike Knudsen, general manager, 
                Southern Golf Oman for construction &amp; maintenance of golf 
                courses; K Vaidyanathan, chief commercial officer; Leon Sassen, 
                manager Memberships and Marketing; N Subramaniam, divisional 
                manager, Synergy LLC, which supplies equipment and accessories 
                to golf courses, and Kathryn Ring, manager Customer Care. Mike 
                Knudsen has built the golf course while Craig Hanney leads a 
                team that includes Omani trainees who will be responsible for 
                the seeding, grassing and maintenance of the fairways and 
                greens.<br>
                <br>
                Says Lahiri, “our story is a bit different, you could even call 
                us a maverick company, as we were born of adversity and went 
                through a rough patch.” The new team is highly unusual and they 
                have a lot of initiative, enterprise and work with emotional 
                commitment. They have very few rules and regulations and have a 
                lot of fun working, as they are all specialists.”<br>
                <br>
                Speaking about the project financing, K Vaidyanathan, chief 
                commercial officer says that BankMuscat is providing its 
                unstinting support to the project with a substantial finance.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

                Kathryn Ring, manager Customer Care, disclosed that earlier the 
                project didn’t have the right direction for a variety of reasons 
                but the new team under Lahiri has been very energetic and is 
                passionately dedicated to the success of Muscat Hills. “There 
                are some ‘naysaying’ customers but when we take them on a site 
                visit, they change their opinion after seeing the work that is 
                going on. We are working as if there is no global crisis,” 
                admits Ring. The contract for construction of the villas, 
                apartments and infrastructure has been awarded to Larsen &amp; 
                Toubro, Oman.<br>
                <br>
                Leon Sassen, a PGA licensed golf teacher, is currently engaged 
                in developing a very limited number of high-value sponsorship 
                opportunities at Muscat Hills by highlighting some of the unique 
                value propositions. Says Sassen, “Muscat Hills is the first 
                grassed 18-hole championship golf course in Oman and we should 
                be able to hold the first PGA championship in 2010. A golf 
                course maintenance academy, and a certified PGA teaching academy 
                are some of the high points of Muscat Hills.” They also have the 
                Majlis Al Said, which offers a full 360 degree view from the 
                highest point of the golf course, informs Sassen.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Golf course</b><br>
                Oman’s first PGA-standard 18 hole golf course was designed by 
                the renowned Paul Thomas of Dave Thomas Associates and 
                integrates the sporting demands of a high quality championship 
                course with the natural beauty of the Omani landscape, 
                contrasted by picturesque fairways, lush greens and dramatic 
                wadis. And it is expected to be the first of its kind in the 
                whole region.<br>
                <br>
                Says Craig Hanney, the superintendent of the golf course: “I was 
                in awe when I first came to Muscat Hills, seeing the sheer 
                rawness of the area where the golf course will come up. It has 
                all the elements – the wind, water, the mountains, the openness 
                and the dry challenging natural environment. I took it as a 
                challenge to bring this course to life.”</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <b>Golf training</b><br>
                A noteworthy feature of Muscat Hills Golf is the Maintenance 
                Academy. The academy will train Omanis in the highly skilled 
                vocations of golf course maintenance. This will provide 
                high-quality employment for Omanis not only in Oman but also all 
                over the world. The academy will be ready by May 2008, informs 
                Mike Knudsen, of Southern Golf Oman, while saying that the 
                science of maintaining the fairways and greens of a golf course 
                has intricate details. “We should take care of the golf course 
                properly in order to give the golfers a good experience,” says 
                Knudsen, a golf course constructor with 26 years of experience.<br>
                <br>
                Muscat Hills is also closely associated with Synergy, Oman’s 
                only dedicated golf equipment supply company. N Subramaniam, who 
                is the divisional manager of Synergy says that since golf is an 
                emerging sport in Oman there was an opportunity to create a 
                unique company to provide these ventures with golf products and 
                services.<br>
                <br>
                Khalil Ibrahim Al Zadjali, Head Mechanic, will be incharge of 
                the Maintenance Academy which will consist of a workshop for 
                servicing the golf machines, which includes the fairway mowers, 
                bunker machines etc.<br>
                <br>
                With such a beehive of activities, it is only a matter of time 
                before Muscat Hills becomes the golfing beacon
                of Oman. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<div align="center">

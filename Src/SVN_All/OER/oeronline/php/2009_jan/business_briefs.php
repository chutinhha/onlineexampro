                British explorer Adrian Hayes has broken the record to reach 
                ‘Three Poles’ – the North Pole, South Pole and the Mount Everest 
                – in the fastest possible time. “The sense of achievement was 
                incredible, but it has been arduous,” he said. The Guinness 
                World Records 2009 has placed Adrian Hayes as the 15th person in 
                the world and the fastest man in history to achieve the ‘Three 
                Poles’ of the earth – reaching the Mount Everest and walking the 
                entire way to the North and South Poles in one year 217 days’ 
                time. Renaissance Services was the major sponsor of Hayes’s 
                quest to achieve this record and the Renaissance logo appears on 
                Hayes’s jacket in the 2009 edition of the Guinness World Record.</font></p>

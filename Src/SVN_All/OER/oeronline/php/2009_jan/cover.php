            Screening (EHS) programme on November 10, 2008. The programme offers 
            a comprehensive evaluation of the medical history, lifestyle habits 
            and a complete physical examination of working executives. The aim 
            of the package is to find out risk factors like heart diseases, 
            cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, vision and hearing 
            abnormalities and so on among executives. Say Dr Rami Neemtallah, 
            medical director, MPH, “The need for such an offer comes from the 
            statistics, which show that the cost of healthcare in the Middle 
            East is rising rapidly. This can be brought down only if we start 
            focusing on prevention and not on treatment alone.”<br>

            <img border="0" src="cover2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="205" height="244"></b>According to a McKinsey Study titled, ‘Gulf Cooperation Council 
            Health Care: Challenges and Opportunities,’ health-care delivery in 
            GCC countries will cost about $60bn by 2025 increasing five fold 
            from the $11.9bn in 2008. Treatment demand will rise 240 per cent, 
            with cardiovascular diseases experiencing a steep increase of 419

            <b>Increased threat perception<br>
            </b>People working in the corporate sector are perceived to be at a 
            higher risk due to a number of reasons. The pressures for delivering 
            numbers, adhering to deadlines, frequent travelling and an 
            increasingly competitive environment lead to a stressful working 
            environment, which can be fatal. Says Dr D Ashokan, assistant chief 
            medical officer, Hatat Polyclinic, “In today’s market-driven 
            environment, stress induces internal disturbances leading to 
            physical and mental debilities like diabetes, hypertension, coronary 
            vascular diseases.” Adds Dr Benny Panakkal, cardiologist and group 
            medical director, Badr Al Samaa, “Stress is one of the underlying 
            causes of diseases like heart attack.” The corporate sector in Oman 
            has itself seen the untimely demise of a few CEO’s in the last 
            couple of years, bringing into focus the need to maintain a 
            work-life balance. </font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time constraints force a number of executives to make lifestyle 
            choices that increase their risk quotient. Says C G Vaz, head-human 
            resources, Bank Sohar, “Since people are busy they just grab 
            anything that they get and eat it. This leads to an intake of junk 
            food.” The growing popularity of fast foods such as pizzas, burgers 
            etc leads to complications like obesity, diabetes and high blood 
            pressure. According to a World Health Organisation study the 
            incidence of Type 2 diabetes and obesity amongst GCC nationals is 
            unusually high relative to the rest of the world. For example, the 
            obesity rate amongst GCC nationals stands at 40 per cent, one of the 
            highest in the world.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover4.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="214" height="261">A sedentary lifestyle and the lack of exercise, compounds the 
            problem. “Everyone whom we talk to says that they do not have the 
            time to exercise. There are others who start exercising and then 
            give up,” says Mona Mogharbi, clinical dietician, MPH. High stress 
            levels leads to fatal secondary habits like smoking. Says Dr 
            Panakkal, “Stressed out people light up a cigarette as a reflex 
            action. In 70 per cent of heart attack cases smoking has been found 
            to be the single biggest factor.”</font></p>
			<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            <b>Personality traits <br>
            </b>Overachieving executives who revel in the corporate sector’s 
            cutthroat environment may be the most vulnerable to fatalities. 
            Explains Dr Panakkal, “Most successful people are Type A 
            personalities. Such people are ambitious, workaholics, prone to 
            stress, anger and get agitated fast and thus have a higher chance of 
            suffering a heart attack.” In contrast Type B personalities are less 
            stressed, easy going and playful.<br>
            <br>
            In today’s man-eat-man corporate culture, traits like aggression are 
            seen as a necessary prerequisite for moving up in life, leading more 
            executives to conform. Paradoxically, the attributes that helps one 
            to rise up the hierarchy, may ultimately prove to be one’s nemesis.
            <br>
            <br>
            Stressful working conditions, an unhealthy lifestyle and personality 
            based vulnerabilities make executives sitting ducks to a host of 
            ailments. Says Dr Panakkal, “High blood pressure, diabetes and heart 
            attacks are silent killers, as they do not have a visible 
            manifestation.” The risk of sub-clinical diseases or ones that are 
            at an asymptomatic stage (whose symptoms may not be apparent 
            readily), makes it important to go in for preventive health 
            check-ups regularly. For example, traditional stress tests detect a 
            cardio vascular problem only if the blockage of a coronary artery is 
            70 per cent and above. Says Dr Neemtallah, “If a stress test is 
            negative it does not mean that a person is fine. There are instances 
            when he may be at a starting point of a blockage. Almost 50 per cent 
            of heart attacks happen in people who are at an asymptomatic stage.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Recent medical research has disproved commonly held notions like 
            women being less prone to coronary heart diseases and heart attacks 
            than men. While the hormone composition of a women’s body may lead 
            to heart attacks at a more advanced stage of their life (around ten 
            years later) than men, the fact is that, ‘twice the women die of the 
            first heart attack than men, and a third of women in the world 
            suffer from heart and cardio vascular diseases. And while one in 
            every 30 women dies of breast cancer one in 2.6 women die of cardio 
            vascular diseases.’</font></p>

            imposes an economic burden on companies. The replacement cost of a 
            CEO or senior executive is a cost that most organisations would like 
            to avoid. Growing awareness about the risks is encouraging companies 
            to bring in better health care policies and systems. Says Vaz, “How 
            much stress can one take, if companies do not take care of their 
            employees they will snap at some point, or the focus may get 
            diluted.”<br>
            <br>
            BankMuscat has put in place an Executive Health Check programme 
            covering a focus group of 77 senior managers and above. Says Salim 
            al Kaabi, assistant general manager, Human Resources, BankMuscat, 
            “Due to business demands and other expectations, most senior 
            officials usually spend long working hours in office. In their quest 
            for achieving a successful life, many senior executives often 
            sacrifice their health. It has been shown that most of the time, 
            people learn about their worsening health when it is already too 
            late to be treated.” </font></p>

            Nawras has a special health care package for its employees working 
            in its customer service contact centres. Says Mohammed Rabia Al-Ghailani, 
            chief people officer, Nawras, “They use a hands-free device 
            throughout the year and handle high levels of pressure as they are 
            the first line of interaction with customers and so we focus closely 
            on their health.” Everyone working in the customer service contact 
            centre is sent for a yearly medical check up. For instance, close to 
            200 of its employees were sent to Apollo Medical Centre for a health 
            screening from January-March 2008. The company has a 
            <img border="0" src="cover10.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="299">medical and 
            life insurance cover for its employees (nationals and expatriates). 
            It has tied up with institutions like Apollo, MPH and Welcare to 
            provide healthcare facilities to its employees in Oman. The coverage 
            extends beyond Oman and people can get treated internationally and 
            get the bills reimbursed by the telecom major. Says Ghailani, “As a 
            company we believe that if we look after our employees, they will 
            in-turn look after our customers better.”<br>
            <br>
            Bank Sohar too has an insurance policy which gives its employees a 
            medical coverage in Oman and certain countries in Asia. In addition, 
            assistant general managers and above are entitled for a preventive 
            health check up every year. Though the facility is available, few 
            executives at the bank have bothered to avail of it. Says Mahira al 
            Raisi, chief manager, manpower planning and recruitment, Bank Sohar, 
            “We need to do more health awareness programmes.”<br>
            <br>
            Every employee at Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has to undergo a 
            full health check up once in two years at the company’s medical 
            facilities. Says Sandeep Kumar. J, COO, Apollo Medical Centre, “It 
            is mandatory for employees of PDO companies like Halliburton to

            the HR department got a number of such requests, especially from 
            women. The bank also has a health club scheme for middle and senior 
            level managers. The bank pays the annual membership fees for these 
            executives and their family members. Close to 80 per cent of the 
            executives have availed of such memberships. Says Munira Abdulnabi 
            Macki, DGM, human resources and corporate support, Bank Sohar, 
            “People stay in an organisation because of the environment and not 
            just the money. Each one of us spends so much time at work that one 
            would like to come to a place where one is happy and gets the 
            support of one’s company.” <br>
            <br>
            Nawras earmarks an annual budget for team building programmes for 
            various departments. For example, in 2008 the contact centre staff 
            spent an entire day at the Coral al Nahda resort in Barka indulging 
            in sports and spa treatments. The company gives its executives the 
            choice to choose their working hours. For example, people can come 
            to office at anytime between 7.30am to 9am and work for eight hours. 
            “We believe in productivity rather than policing,” says Ghailani.

            Sarel Myburgh, deputy general manager, Al Fair corroborates the 
            trend, “The demand for healthy food is growing, there is a trend 
            towards more healthy foods, organic foods with less calories, fruits 
            and yoghurts.” Al Fair, a popular supermarket has over 1000 SKU’s 
            (stock keeping units) related to healthy foods on its shelves. In 
            addition, the chain also has diabetic ranges in its  </font>

            customers coming in with labels of healthier products asking us to 
            procure them,” adds Myburgh. To satisfy this growing demand Al Fair 
            has introduced products like Omega hi fibre whole meal breads, Promovil soya yoghurts, St.dalfor’s diabetic jams, Dorset’s muesli 
            range and salads imported from the US.</font></p>

            <b>State-of-the-art facilities<br>
            </b> </font>
            <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Private clinics and hospitals are introducing tailor-made health 
            screening packages for executives to suit their convenience. As most 
            executives are hard pressed for time these tests are compressed into 
            a few hours. For example, if executives went in for individual 
            kidney function tests, blood count, lipid profile, liver function 
            tests, TFT, ECG’s one at a time, these tests can take upto a few 
            days as a patient would have to go to a number of doctors. Secondly, 
            going in for individual check-ups proves to be far more costlier 
            than taking an executive package. For example, Apollo Medical 
            Centres, Executive Health Check Up costs between RO80-120, Hatat 
            Polyclinic’s Wellness package for men above 40 years costs RO75 and 
            the package for women RO120 and Badr Al Samaa’s Executive cardiac 
            check up programme 
            </font>
            <img border="0" src="cover17.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="210" height="294"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">comes for RO65. If these were undergone 
            individually the costs of these tests would go up to RO150 or more.<br>
            <br>
            Apollo has created a VIP lounge for people undergoing an Executive’s 
            Check up. An executive is taken care of by a personal attendant from 
            the moment he arrives at the polyclinic till he leaves. The 
            polyclinic gets 8-10 executives every week. Says Kumar, “We promote 
            the package saying, ‘you deserve a day with us.’ In 2009 we are 
            planning to promote health check up service areas.” <br>
            <br>
            </font>
            <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hospitals have also been spending money on getting the best in class 
            equipment for such treatments. For example, MPH’s EHS package 
            includes a state-of-the-art heart scan on 64 detectors CT. The 
            non-invasive procedure can detect any abnormality in the heart and 
            analyse coronary arteries for calcifications and obstructions even 
            if they are as low as 10 per cent. The detectors are also used for 
            colon cancer screening. For more complicated treatments like bypass 
             
            </font>
            <img border="0" src="cover18.jpg" width="175" height="265" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">surgery, kidney transplant, cancer etc polyclinics in Oman have a 
            tie-up with super specialty hospitals internationally. Badr Al Samaa 
            has plans of opening up a super specialty hospital in Muscat in the 
            next two years. Says Dvevassy K O, manager marketing, Badr Al Samaa, 
            “6000-8000 patients from Oman fly to countries like Thailand, India 
            and Germany for advanced medical treatment and we would like to 
            provide them with such facilities here.”</font></p>

            <b>Insurance issues<br>
            </b>The lack of an insurance cover for health screenings is cited as 
            a major problem in popularising preventive healthcare in Oman. Says 
            Dr Ashokan, “Insurance companies do not want us to investigate 
            whether a person has a health problem or not, but it is in the 
            larger interests of the insurance company and patients that we look 
            at preventive healthcare.” In principle there is no denying that 
            medical insurance is a coverage for an ailment that happens to a 
            person and not a coverage for something that may happen to someone.
            <br>

            <img border="0" src="cover19.jpg" width="192" height="271" align="right"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deepak Kamath, country manager, Oman, Axa Insurance says, “We 
            believe that an annual health screening should be compulsory for 
            executives over the age 40 as it  </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">is in the interest of individuals 
            and companies.” He adds, “Axa has products that cover health 
            screenings in Oman.” For example, people subscribing to Axa’s Global 
            Area 1 plan are entitled for a health screening after nine months of 
            membership. The RO1500 per annum premium may be a bit steep for 
            most, but Kamath suggests a way out, “The price for the policy drops 
            to a third (RO500) if one excludes the US from its coverage. One can 
            always take a travel insurance policy, while going to the US.” Thus 
            there are insurance companies which are ready to come up with 
            tailor-made solutions for executives, what is needed is more 
            awareness to disseminate the </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            need for such solutions.</font><img border="0" src="cover20.jpg" width="182" height="257" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"></p>

            <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patient education </font>
            <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">in the Middle East has lagged far behind advanced 
            countries like the US and Europe. Conventionally, talking about 
            diseases has been a taboo subject in West Asia and Asia, but with 
            the growing health threats faced by various strata of society there 
            is a need for health awareness programmes. Says Neemtallah, “Private 
            healthcare organisations should work together to produce brochures, 
            education materials etc and the media should focus on this.” And it 
            is upto executives to set the standards as Myburgh says, “As stress 
            levels increase it is important for executives to look after 
            themselves, because if you do not take care you lose not just health 
            but also your managerial abilities.” The choice for executives is 
            simple – prevention versus demise, take your pick. </font></p>

            </b><img border="0" src="cover21.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="150" height="187">Sulaiman al Harthy, group deputy general manager, consumer 
            banking group, BankMuscat underwent an Executive Health Screening at 
            Muscat Private Hospital. He shares his experience and thoughts on 
            executive healthcare with OER<br>
            <br>
            Most working executives are not conscious about the need to strike a 
            work-life balance. I have to literally push people out of the office 
            for them to go home or else they would continue working 24/7. Our 
            culture is such that people go on till they start suffering from a 
            fatal disease. Though senior executives in a number of companies are 
            entitled for a health screening, most of them do not get this done. 
            People have to realise that though they may feel fit and even walk 
            half-an-hour a day, it does not mean that they are immune to a 
            number of fatal diseases, which can be detected only once you go in 
            for a thorough medical check up. One of my customers discovered that 
            he had a minor heart attack only when he underwent a medical 
            check-up (for insurance) to avail of a loan at BankMuscat. <br>
            <br>
            Omanis have a number of social commitments in far flung places which 
            eats into the time that they could otherwise spend on exercising. 
            Our diet and lifestyle is also pretty unhealthy as we tend to eat a 
            lot of meat, ghee etc. Even nutritious things like honey, gets 
            consumed in such quantities that it negates the benefits. It 
            requires a lot of discipline to maintain a healthy life. The good 
            news is that young people are educated and are getting conscious 
            about their health. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Taking the plunge <br>
            </b>I have undergone health screenings in the UAE and when I heard 
            that Muscat Private Hospital had brought in state-of-the-art 
            equipment, I decided to go in for it. I have had heart checkups, 
            cardiography and stress tests earlier but this was the first time 
            that I underwent an MRI. One has to fast for 12 hours before 
            undergoing the screening. Alcohol consumption is prohibited for 72 
            hours prior to the tests. I reached MPH around nine, and was 
            escorted by a nurse for the check-ups. The entire check-up took four 
            hours in all from 9 am to 1 pm. The doctors did a blood test to 
            check the blood sugar level, blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol, 
            thyroid, HIV, uric acid and infectious disease tests were done. This 
            was followed by a thorough check of the lungs, ears, eyes, liver and 
            kidneys. <br>
            <br>
            Then they gave me two bottles of water and took an X-ray of the 
            chest. After which I was taken for an MRI. I was made to lie down 
            and injected with some sort of a medicine and put through the 64 
            detector CT scanner. The machine scans the functioning of ones 
            heart, the arteries and various chambers. In the end one goes in for 
            a consultation with a dietician, who prescribes a diet chart. One is 
            also given a CD of one’s heart. I need to go back to MPH for a 
            follow up in a week’s time.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Spend for your life<br>
            </b>One feels anxious while undergoing the tests, but once you come 
            out and are told that everything is fine, then you know that you 
            have a long life to live. In Arabic there is a saying ‘Health, is 
            like a crown on your head.’ Strangely there are people who feel 
            disappointed when they are told that they are alright. They think 
            that either the machines are not working or that the doctor is not 
            good.<br>
            <br>
            I have convinced my wife to undertake the Executive Health Screening 
            and she will be going for it soon. I recommend a health check up to 
            every executive as, “Irrespective of whether you or your company 
            pays that RO500, it is an investment that each one of us should be 
            ready to spend on ourselves.”</font></td>

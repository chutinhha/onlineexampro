                <b>The fall in global oil prices added to the woes of the 
                regional markets which are reeling under the impact of the 
                global credit crisis<br>
                </b><br>
                Muscat Securities Market (MSM) has been struggling to sustain 
                above the sentimental 6000 mark for the past few weeks, each 
                time slipping below the mark due to excessive selling pressure. 
                The benchmark MSM 30 index lost 4.1 per cent (or 257 points) to 
                close at 5966 led by the Banking and Industry sectors. Investors 
                appear nervous on building long positions at current levels 
                since global markets are very volatile and any negative news 
                will have a more intense impact on regional markets including 
                MSM. Persisting weakness in oil prices adds to the worries of an 
                already weak market.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Plummeting trade volumes<br>
                </b>Brokerage businesses have been adversely affected due to the 
                thinning of market turnover, which slipped to RO3.9mn (average 
                per day) from about RO10.8mn in the previous month. Optimism 
                generated over the introduction of new market stabilisation fund 
                by the Capital Market Authority also fizzled out after a while, 
                keeping the traders away.<br>
                <br>
                In corporate events, National Gas Company, announced the 
                formation of a new 50:50 Joint Venture “Unigaz” with paid up 
                capital of RO150,000, in partnership with Unigaz International 
                WLL, Bahrain. The primary activities of this company will be LPG 
                marketing and engineering of gas systems. In another important 
                development, the Board of Directors of OIFC at their meeting 
                held on December 2, 2008, resolved to reverse the earlier 
                decision taken on October 29, 2008 to buy back the shares of the 
                Company to the extent of 10 per cent of the capital of the 
                company.<br>
                <br>
                The Board of Directors of Al Jazeera Steel Products Company 
                informed the market that the company’s shares will be listed on 
                the Dubai Financial Market on December 18, 2008. The communiqué 
                also claimed that Jazeera Steel will be the first company in 
                Oman to have its shares listed in Dubai Financial Market.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <b>Regional downturn<br>
                </b>The one month period ended December 15, 2008 was another 
                tough one for the GCC markets with the MSCI GCC index dropping 
                one per cent during this time amidst lacklustre trade. Most 
                markets remained closed during the second week of December owing 
                to Eid Al Adha holidays. All the major markets except for Qatar 
                and Kuwait registered sharp declines with the Dubai Financial 
                Market topping the list and ending down 7.5 per cent. Most major 
                indices ended in red with real estate and investment indices 
                leading the pack. DFM is the biggest YTD decliner in the GCC 
                having fallen 70.8 per cent since January 2007. The Bahrain 
                Market was the next poor performer for the month and the market 
                index lost 5.9 per cent. The Saudi TASI lost 4.7 per cent during 
                the month with moderate selling seen across all major sectoral 
                indices. Declining oil prices fuelled the negative sentiments in 
                the petrochemical sector, and the industrial, investment and 
                banking indices accentuated the decline. <br>
                <br>
                Qatar’s Doha Securities Market and Kuwait Stock Exchange were 
                the two markets which ended on a positive note with their 
                respective general indices gaining 10.4 per cent and 3.2 per 
                cent. While favourable news flow on share buybacks propped the 
                DSM up, Kuwaiti investors remained hopeful of an intervention by 
                sovereign funds to stabilise the market.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <br>
                Worsening global credit crises and falling oil prices are the 
                prime reasons for the lackluster performance of the GCC bourses. 
                The GCC governments have taken a series of initiatives to 
                support their respective economies via deposit guarantees, 
                easing monetary policies among others. Another positive is that 
                despite the turmoil and falling oil prices, governments have not 
                cut back on fiscal spending or backtracked on projects of 
                national importance. <br>

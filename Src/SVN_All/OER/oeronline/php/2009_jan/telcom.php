            the five Class II license operators in Oman, has quietly worked 
            behind the scenes for its final launch. Mohammed Alhashili, CEO, 
            speaks to Visvas Paul D Karra in his first media interview<br>
            </b><br>
            <img border="0" src="tele1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="311">In October 2008, Mazoon National Telecommunications Company (Mazoon 
            Mobile) had announced a strategic tie-up with ZTE (Zhong Xing 
            Telecommunication Equipment Company Limited) of China, for the 
            supply of intelligent network platform for its mobile services. At 
            that time, perhaps, one would have been led to believe that Mazoon 
            Mobile, which is one of the five mobile resellers to get a Class II 
            telecom license in Oman, would be first to launch a service. 
            However, that was not to be as two other mobile resellers (Majan and 
            FRiENDi) promptly went to town saying that they are all set to roll 
            out their services.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Slowly and surely</b><br>
            But Mazoon Mobile is unfazed by these developments. Mohammed 
            Alhashili, CEO of Mazoon Mobile, firmly believes that by not 
            grabbing the first mover advantage, they stand to gain a lot. “But 
            that does not necessarily mean we will not launch our operations 
            soon. We are ready with our launch preparations as equally as the 
            others who have announced their intentions to begin their services 
            in the first quarter of 2009,” Alhashili pointed out. Mazoon Mobile, 
            apparently, has not waited to sign an agreement with a host operator 
            in order to begin their planning for a launch. In fact, Omani 
            employees have already been deputed to China for training and a 
            swank new office has been taken up in the Shatti area.<br>
            <br>
            “The fact that we have sent our employees for training to China 
            indicates how seriously we are working on the launch of our 
            operations. The agreement with a host operator will eventually 
            happen, by which time we would be ready with all other 
            preparations,” says Alhashili, when asked to reveal the status of 
            their company.<br>
            <br>
            Sitting in his office overlooking the azure Gulf of Oman Sea near 
            Grand Hyatt, Alhashili just sweeps his hand across his office and 
            says, “Look at our office and our equipment. Everything is ready. 
            Our branding campaign is in place, our SIM cards and recharge 
            vouchers are there, our website is up and running, our brand 
            ambassador is also waiting in the wings. So for all you know, we 
            could launch our services in the same period as our competitors.”<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="tele2.jpg" width="250" height="183" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Mazoon Mobile is a joint venture between Middle East 
            Telecommunications Company (METCO), a Towell group company; and 
            Bahrain’s Etisalcom, with each holding 51 per cent and 49 per cent 
            stake respectively. Between them, the board of directors of Mazoon 
            Mobile, the management and employees have a combined 
            telecommunications experience of more than 200 years having worked 
            in top telecom companies like Batelco, Zain, Omantel, Oman Mobile, 
            Sprints PCS, Nokia Siemens, Ericsson, Huawei, Nawras etc.<br>
            <br>
            Mazoon Mobile is also taking care that its Omanisation programme is 
            on schedule. Presently, around 70 per cent of its staff is Omani 
            while the rest of them are a blend of different nationalities having 
            vast experiences in the telecom field. As mobile resellers require a 
            partnership with one of two existing host operators, Mazoon Mobile 
            is negotiating with both Oman Mobile and Nawras and discussions are 
            in the final stages. Mazoon will be announcing these details once 
            the agreement is finalised.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Latest technology<br>
            </b>Mazoon Mobile, which is targeting a major role for itself in the 
            Sultanate’s liberalised mobile telecom sector, has entered into a 
            partnership with ZTE in order to obtain state-of-the-art 
            technological supremacy in the telecom field. The company has also 
            set up a fully equipped network and operations centre in the same 
            place as their corporate office and believes that this location will 
            help them to connect quickly to the host operator for a variety of 
            reasons. In its bid to be a model mobile reseller in the Middle 
            East, Mazoon Mobile wants to address the customer lifestyle needs 
            and deliver value with differentiating services. In this regard, the 
            company has been deliberately keeping a low profile so as not to 
            give the consumers and market a wrong picture.<br>
            <br>
            With five mobile resellers in the market, the most obvious question 
            is how each company is going to tap the market. According to 
            Alhashili, the Omani mobile market is at 100 per cent penetration. 
            One may think this is a saturation level. However, and contrary to 
            this, other markets in Gulf countries have reached penetration 
            levels of more than 150 per cent. This surely indicates the 
            potential for growth in the Sultanate’s market. Alhashili, praised 
            the TRA for the bold and distinguished efforts to liberalize the 
            telecom market and creating opportunity for fair competition. He 
            added, “As a mobile reseller, we need to be different from our 
            competitors in order to survive. We will launch different programmes 
            and create a brand which Omanis will find easy to identify with,” 
            says Alhashili.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Proving their worth</b><br>
            According to him, mobile resellers, combined, will be able to tap 
            around 30 per cent of the existing mobile customers. Since there are 
            going to be five players in the Omani market, each of them will be 
            vying for a share out of this. But only those who can prove 
            themselves will remain in the market, opines Alhashili. Explaining 
            further, Alhashili says that in order to capture the market share, 
            mobile resellers (also known as MVNOs in other markets) have options 
            of providing value added services in their voice and data services. 
            “I can give you an example. But I am not saying we will be doing 
            this. A mobile reseller can provide a value addition to the 
            ubiquitous pager which hangs on the trouser belt of a doctor. How 
            can this be done? Simply by providing him access to SMS and other 
            similar features like voicemail,” Alhashili says.<br>
            <br>
            Similarly there are other segments like women who would like to read 
            and know about things like fashion. These are likely groups that can 
            be served by mobile resellers, he says. Mazoon Mobile would be 
            providing both voice and data services appropriate to fit the 
            addressed niches and segments.

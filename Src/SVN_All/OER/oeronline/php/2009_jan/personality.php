            <b>Candid and unpretentious Virendra Agarwal, CEO, Moosa Abdul 
            Rahman stands apart in a crowd. By Mayank Singh<br>
            </b><br>
            <img border="0" src="person1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="228">Virendra Agarwal, CEO, Moosa Abdul Rahman Hassan and Company (MARH) 
            learnt Aristotle’s maxim, “Take an all absorbing interest in the 
            secret of success of those who have succeeded,” early in life and 
            has been its avid practitioner. If learning from others has been an 
            integral part of his growth, financial acumen is a close second. “I 
            get excited making money for my company and for myself,” he says 
            matter-of-factly.<br>
            <br>
            In 1999-2000 when the owners decided to professionalise MARH’s 
            senior management, Agarwal was chosen to lead the company as its CEO. 
            And he has lived up to the board’s expectations over the years. 
            Agarwal has brought in new distributorships like Suzuki and has 
            ventured into new lines of business like the supply of military 
            vehicles. The company has expanded its sales and service network to 
            Sohar, Salalah, Nizwa etc.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="person.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="144" height="271">He earned his stripes early in life, by becoming the general manager 
            of the office equipment division of Mustafa Sultan Enterprises 
            (known as Mustafa and Jawad) in 1989 at a young age of 30. Agarwal’s 
            experience with the Tata group in India early in his career has 
            stood him in good stead. “Working with the Tata’s teaches one to 
            manage relationships and to be commercially astute,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Principles of success<br>
            </b>A management alumnus of the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of 
            Management Studies in Mumbai, Agarwal joined the Tata group after he 
            graduated in Economics from Bombay University. At Tata Exports he 
            handled a range of products from leather to Tata trucks. He later on 
            moved to Lakme India, a cosmetics company and worked closely with 
            Simone Tata, the chairman and managing director in growing its 
            business in Eastern Europe. Apart from this, Agarwal also did short 
            stints with Johnson and Johnson and Corus in India.<br>
            <br>
            He feels that a CEO should understand his business, get the right 
            people, equip them with the right vision and leave them alone. 
            Though if the need arises Agarwal can be a hands on manager. “If I 
            am not confident of someone’s abilities then I am there all the 
            time. Over 50 per cent of my time is spent in businesses which are 
            growing.” Agarwal is one of the few CEO’s who sets a budgetary 
            target for himself and is out in the market selling products. A 
            person who can think on his feet, he prides himself on his decision 
            making abilities, “We never procrastinate matters by sitting on a 
            decision.”<br>
            <br>
            Looking back he fondly remembers his school days at Mayo College in 
            Ajmer. Founded by Richard Southwell Bourke, The Earl of Mayo and the 
            Viceroy of India from 1868 to 1872, the school was established with 
            the intent of making British gentlemen out of Indian princes. “Mayo 
            was a great leveller, as everyone from a prince to someone from a 
            middle class background was treated as an equal and put through the 
            grind.”<br>
            <br>
            <b>Time out <br>
            <img border="0" src="person2.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="311"></b>He splits his leisure time between his family and playing golf. 
            His better half Tarini works as a training manager at MARH; Vickram 
            his son is an executive with General Motors, Dubai and daughter 
            Tarika, a high school student is looking at pursuing her higher 
            studies abroad. The family pet Vodka, a three year old Labrador also 
            demands his fair share of attention. Says Agarwal, “He was a 
            birthday gift for my daughter and I take him out for walks three to 
            four times a day.” The family spends time together by going to the 
            beach, playing golf, swimming or dinning out. “The family always 
            comes first,” says Agarwal.<br>
            <br>
            An annual vacation is another excuse to catch up with each other. A 
            Mediterranean cruise across the cities of Barcelona, Nice, Monte 
            Carlo, Florence, Rome and Sicily in 2003 proved to be such a 
            memorable experience that he did it all over again (with his 
            extended family) in 2008 to celebrate his parents 50th marriage 
            anniversary.<br>
            <br>
            “Apart from seeing some great places, it is the sheer luxury and 
            lifestyle choices that spoil you,” avers Agarwal. South East Asian 
            destinations like Singapore, Malaysia and Bangkok have been another 
            favourite hunting ground for the family. “South East Asian people 
            are simple, hard working, humble and tourist friendly,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Pursuing ones dreams </b><br>
            Golf remains the other big love of his life. Having started out on 
            the course as a caddie to his father, he has been an avid follower 
            of the sport for over 30 years now. “Golf is an addiction, a game 
            where you compete against yourself and not against others.” He rues 
            the lack of green top courses in Muscat and cites it as a reason for 
            his dwindling interest in the game over the last three-to-four 
            years. He tries to make up for his lack of exercise on weekdays by 
            walking a couple of hours on weekends.<br>
            <br>
            An avid reader, he is partial towards fiction writers like John 
            Grisham and Wilbur Smith. Growing up in a family where his father 
            Mahendra and mother Bala Agarwal are avid readers, he picked up the 
            habit early. “I read the 1,400 page The Count of Monte Cristo by 
            Alexandre Dumas when I was in class eight,” he says. The passage of 
            time has strengthened his belief on books being a man’s best friend. 
            When it comes to movies he prefers comedies and light-hearted 
            stories. “Business is so stressful that at the end of the day you 
            want to unwind something that is slightly less taxing,” says Agarwal.<br>
            <br>
            Looking back at the people who have left an imprint on him he 
            recalls one of his first bosses, Rajan Jhanjhir, “If someone 
            requested for a business meeting, he would go to the other person’s 
            office instead of calling them over.” Agarwal has imbibed the habit 
            and has no qualms of visiting a customer at his office. He thanks 
            his father, a former naval officer for inculcating the right values 
            and discipline in him and his siblings. A worthy son Agarwal has 
            surely reached such heights that others can take an absorbing 
            interest in the secrets of his success. </font></p>

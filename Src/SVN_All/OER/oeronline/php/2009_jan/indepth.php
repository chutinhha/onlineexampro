                Small investors think that institutions have an edge over them 
                as they have access to better market information, financial 
                data, modelling etc, but this is not necessarily true. Fund 
                managers are usually driven by a herd mentality, as most 
                institutions benchmark themselves against their competitors. As 
                a result 80-90 per cent of the fund managers all around the 
                world underperform the market. Thus the smart investor is 
                actually not so smart and an average investor can thus buy into

                <b>Worst year in living memory</b><br>
                <img border="0" src="indepth.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="225" height="221">The year 2008 was the worst year for stock markets the world 
                over, since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Over $31trn has 
                vanished from the markets (excluding the losses on housing 
                mortgages). International markets have fallen by anywhere 
                between 30-70 per cent. Currency losses have been to the tune of 
                70 per cent. The sub prime crisis has led to a global credit 
                contraction. The amount of wealth that has been eroded cannot be 
                recovered in the next year or two years and will take a longer 
                time to create. Gulf economies were doing well till June 2008 as 
                oil prices touched a historic high of $147 per barrel. MSM 
                touching an all time high of 12,000 points. Starting at 9000 
                points in January, the index was up by 32 per cent in the first 
                six months of the year. Surprisingly, during these months the 
                Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti stock markets were falling and the MSM 
                was the only outperformer.<br>
                <br>
                The sub prime crisis and the ensuing credit crisis forced 
                institutions and individuals to deleverage their investments 
                leading to a severe fall in all asset classes. Oil prices fell 
                from $147 per barrel in July to a low of $34 per barrel in 
                December 2008, a drop of 70 per cent. Gold fell from $1000 per 
                ounce in 2007 to $700 per ounce in 2008. Commodities have lost 
                over 40 per cent of their value. A lot of speculative money that 
                was coming into the Gulf stopped suddenly. As a result the MSM 
                crashed by 50 per cent in five months from July. Overall, the 
                markets are down by 32 per cent for the year, the severest fall 
                that the MSM has seen in such a span of time.<br>
                <br>
                Despite such a fall the MSM has done better than Saudi Arabian 
                and the Dubai Financial Markets which fell by 65 per cent. Banks 
                in Oman do not have the same kind of exposure to the real estate 
                market as Dubai, largely because the Central Bank of Oman has 
                pegged the limit for real estate lending at eight per cent, but 
                a lot of funds have found their way into real estate and the 
                stock market as the end use of such funds is not usually 
                checked. Once things started to deteriorate the Central Bank of 
                Oman and the government intervened with a number of measures 
                like increasing the loan-to-deposit ratio to 87.5 per cent and 
                cutting the cash reserve ratio from eight per cent to five per 
                cent. Oman is not as vulnerable to the world as some other 
                markets are due to the insular nature of its economy.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Looking ahead <br>
                </b>
                <img border="0" src="indepth1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="138">Investor confidence is low and there is uncertainty in the 
                market. I expect corporate profits to come down as the nominal 
                GDP will contract in 2009. So how does one go about investing in 
                2009. Generally there are two approaches to investing, one is 
                the technical, which takes into account charts and fundamental 
                approach which is based on balance sheets and whether a stock is 
                trading above or below value. The GBCM approach is based on Core 
                Value investing, which translates into buying a dollar when 
                someone is selling it for 50 cents and then selling it at par 
                value. We believe in the Value Investing approach propounded by 
                Benjamin Graham, he says, “Markets are manic depressives, in the 
                short term they are voting machines but in the long term they 
                are weighing machines.” Everyone should invest keeping in mind 
                their margin-of-safety, as these are the three most important 
                words in investing.<br>
                <br>
                Further there are two ways to choose – the top-down or bottom-up 
                approach. The top-down approach looks at which industry will do 
                well in future, oil price projections, the country’s deficits 
                etc. The bottom-up approach is about looking at the profits of a 
                company, the size of its assets, NPAs and then going to the top. 
                I believe that investors should us the latter approach.<br>
                <br>
                Says Warren Buffet, Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway, “An investor 
                should invest within ones circle of competence,” he adds, “It is 
                not how big ones circle of competence is but how well you define 
                the parameters.” Retail investors usually do not understand 
                sophisticated industries or companies but in Oman most of these 
                are easy to understand. Once you have identified companies that 
                you would like to invest in, then one should look at the value 
                of these companies. This can be done by zeroing in on, ‘the 
                present value of the future free cash flow available to the 
                consumer.’ This sum equals to what the company can distribute to 
                its investors in future.<br>
                <br>
                The dollar cost averaging method is another tool that can be 
                followed by investors profitably. The method requires one to 
                invest a certain amount of money every month or quarter over a 
                period of time (probably during the next 12-18 months). This 
                takes out the uncertainty out of one’s investment decisions and 
                lowers the average purchase price of a stock as one buys them at 
                both high and low levels.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Working out the risk-reward ratio</b><br>
                While investing one should look at the risk-reward ratio. If I 
                invest a dollar at these levels what is the upside and downside. 
                At 12,000 levels the risk of a downside was much more than 5000 
                levels. Since the stock markets are forward looking and move 
                12-18 months in advance of the actual economy, a lot of bad news 
                has already been factorised at these price levels, giving a good 
                chance of an upside. The markets are trading at a huge discount, 
                for example – banking stocks which were trading at 14-16 times 
                their book value are now trading at 1.2 to 1.5 times.<br>
                <br>
                On the macro level, oil prices will bottom out at $40 per barrel 
                and hopefully rise to $70 per barrel by Q3-Q4 of 2009. We expect 
                the average price of oil to be around $60 per barrel. Corporate 
                profitability will show a nominal fall as it is co-related to 
                the GDP. At the current levels, the macro economic picture of 
                Oman looks fine and there is nothing to get worried about. Says 
                Buffet, “We tend to be greedy when others are fearful and 
                fearful when others are greedy.” Probably this is the time for 
                investors to be greedy.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1"><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>

                be to focus on good shares to make money. For a start, investors 
                should look at the performance of a country’s economy as it will 
                have an impact on companies in the next couple of years. <br>
                <br>
                Unlike earlier, when the price-earnings ratio (P/E) was the 
                first criteria being looked at, in the current scenario I would 
                suggest looking at the price-to-book ratio (P/B) first as it 
                gives a clear cut understanding of a company’s worth. This gives 
                one the comfort that one is buying a company at its book value 
                and not at its fair value. The next step would be obviously 
                looking at the P/E ratio and then the cash flow of the company.
                <br>
                <br>
                Asset managers evaluate companies based on either a top-down 
                (based on an economy) or a bottom-up model (starting from a 
                company’s fundamentals). In a falling market a bottom’s up 
                approach would be more suitable for retail investors. While 
                buying a stock investors should factorise the growth of the last 
                three quarters of that company. In 2008, the first two quarters 
                were good and the impact of the global slowdown was visible only 
                around the third quarter. The last quarter of 2008 and the first 
                quarter of 2009 can serve as a guideline for the coming year.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Go for good returns <br>
                </b>Some investors look out for stocks which give a good dividend 
                but I am not inclined to recommend such stocks as in any 
                investment there needs to be an element of risk, second, the 
                growth potential of such stocks is limited. The dividend returns 
                are marginally better than a bank’s fixed deposit and so I would 
                suggest not to buy stocks for earning a mere dividend return.<br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="indepth3.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="197" height="172">Geographically, I see the Asian markets getting impacted to a 
                small extent due to the size of the population of these 
                countries. The GCC countries will also come out relatively 
                unscathed as the price of oil will bounce back. These two 
                regions will have a better chance of doing well in 2009 compared 
                to other international economies like the US and Europe.<br>
                <br>
                Looking back, I feel that the rise of the MSM was just too 
                sharp, without a fundamental justification. While the MSM index 
                will not go back to the same levels soon, investors can expect 
                15-20 per cent returns in 2009. We expect the markets to start 
                climbing back from March 2009. The price of oil will continue to 
                be an important criteria but it is unlikely that prices will go 
                down to the level seen in the early 1990s ($10-$12 per barrel).<br>
                <br>
                The banking sector is a safe bet as banks have a good cash flow 
                with no liquidity problems. Given the global crisis it is 
                important to check out the loans that a company has on its books 
                as a big exposure can put additional pressure on a company. The 
                loan should be seen in relation to the capital of a company and 
                not just as an actual amount.<br>
                <br>
                Over the next three months investors should start building a 
                portfolio as the rally can begin as early as February 2009. The 
                attractive valuations makes it is a good time to buy and people 
                should refrain from selling if there is a sudden fall in the 
                markets. One should not go by the daily fluctuations of the 
                market and remain invested for a period of time.<br>

                and with a number of property projects underway across the 
                country, real estate investments are expected to exceed $20bn by 
                2010. A number of these real estate developments are aimed at 
                attracting inbound tourists to the Sultanate of Oman.<br>

                </b>Despite the global credit crunch, recession, bankruptcies and 
                redundancies, the development and maturity of the housing market 
                will continue in Oman. The Sultanate is better placed than most 
                of the countries in the GCC to weather the storm now. Dubai for 
                instance has witnessed a fall in property prices to the tune of

                (LTV) ratios on residential mortgages. It is important to make 
                lending facilities more favourable to people entering the 
                property market. The lack of lending for the end-user at 
                affordable rates and on achievable LTV ratios has dented 
                property values and demand. As 2008 draws to a close it is 
                difficult to forecast what will happen in 2009. However, we 
                continue to support our views that Oman will gradually recover 
                from the global crisis. The property market will be more stable 
                as speculators who have driven values up to phenomenal levels, 
                leave the market. To a large extent, they have done their job 
                and set benchmarks in terms of property values but the end users 
                and workers who are here for the long-haul will nurture the 
                market, and increase values at a much slower rate and more in 
                line with growth.<br>
                <br>
                Positive news and signs of encouragement is what is required 
                from the government and banks as this will improve things in the 
                current situation. As money is injected into the economy, there 
                will be a time-lag in reaping the benefits. Therefore investors 
                should look at long term investments in such a situation. The 
                global scale of economies and the dynamics of the property 
                markets in each country are never or at least rarely on 
                equilibrium paths. We expect some dark clouds lifting during 
                2009 but not in Q1 or Q2.<br>

                <img border="0" src="indepth6.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="292" height="269">The year 2008 was a speculative market and there were a number 
                of people in the market who were buying property to sell it at 
                higher rates. These speculative values were not justified by 
                either the developments or the end use. The market was quite 
                active till the summer months and then there was a gradual 
                slowdown. The speculative market that was witnessed during the 
                period 2006 to mid 2008 has died down. As a result there has 
                been a correction in prices (primarily amongst plots). A similar 
                trend was witnessed in other markets where speculative values 
                have corrected by 30 to 50 per cent. Lately a number of 
                investors from the region started investing in real estate in 
                Oman, but such demand too has abated.<br>
                <br>
                <b>A time to buy <br>
                </b>In Oman there has been a 20 per cent price correction in the 
                capital area. We believe that this is the time for serious 
                buyers to get into the market as these prices present a once in 
                a generation opportunity. We expect prices to move up in the 
                next 24-30 months.<br>
                <br>
                Integrated Tourism Complexes (ITCs) like the Muscat Hills Golf 
                and Country Club are a good bet for the future. In The Wave, for 
                instance buyers of the first phase can expect to get a rental 
                return of 10 per cent. The second and third phase owners can 
                expect a six per cent renal return. A combination of careful 
                analysis and sound negotiations will help astute investors to 
                realise some fantastic opportunities. These ITCs give buyers a 
                chance to live within a commutable distance from the centre of 
                the town. There have been reports that the government is not 
                allowing new ITCs to come up till the ones which have been 
                approved get delivered, this further enhances their appeal.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Spreading of interest<br>
                </b>
                <img border="0" src="indepth7.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="197" height="185">Traditionally real estate interest has centered on Muscat, but 
                Sohar, Salalah, Duqm and Barka are also drawing interest. Sohar 
                is seeing the development of new projects like the Saud Bahwan 
                Palm Gardens. Oman as a whole is undergoing a big transformation 
                -- the Muscat Expressway is expected to encourage real estate 
                development in Muscat and Barka. As the industrial area moves 
                out of Ghala a lot of land will become available for residential 
                development. The Batinah rail project is expected to open up new 
                opportunities later.<br>
                <br>
                There has been a delay in a number of projects, creating a 
                demand-supply mismatch in the residential and commercial space 
                in Muscat. This led to a steep rise in rents and capital value 
                of property in Muscat. Areas like CBD (Central Business 
                District) have reached capacity and the attendant congestion is 
                forcing companies to move out.<br>
                <br>
                But with good quality properties like Janayin Sama, Talal al 
                Khoud, Tilal Complex and Qaryat Qurm coming up things should 
                stabilise. </font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <b>Future prospects <br>
                </b>The real estate market in Oman is expected to continue its rapid 
                growth with analysts predicting the value of demand reaching 
                RO8bn by 2010. For buyers looking at the international market, 
                London promises to be a good bet. The fall in property prices 
                and the erosion of the pound sterling has opened new vistas for 
                high networth individuals. Central London house prices fell by 
                6.4 per cent during the Q3, 2008, the largest quarterly fall in 
                the index’s history. Finally, investors should invest in real 
                estate, keeping in mind the cyclical nature of the market and 
                wait for the upside.<br>

                <img border="0" src="indepth10.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="311">Since time immemorial, gold has been valued as a global 
                currency, a commodity, an investment and simply an object of 
                beauty. Recent years have seen a striking increase in investor 
                interest in gold. <br>
                <br>
                Does that mean it’s too late to join the gold rush? Hardly. 
                Infact this is the ideal time to invest in the king of metals. 
                And these days it’s easier than ever to invest in gold. Gold is 
                considered as the world’s premier monetary and chaos hedging 
                asset. In the past six years demand for gold has risen to 173 
                per cent and gold stocks have gone up by 300 per cent.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Increasing attractiveness<br>
                </b>To put it simply, gold is becoming more desirable as the return 
                on bonds, equities and real estate is not good enough to 
                compensate for the risk and inflation. Experts maintain that it 
                is the right time now, to bet on gold as an investment. <br>
                <br>
                There are a wide range of reasons and motivations for people and 
                institutions seeking to invest in gold. A positive price 
                outlook, underpinned by expectations that the growth in demand 
                for the precious metal will continue to outstrip that of supply, 
                provides a solid rationale for investment. The other key driver 
                is gold’s abilities to insure against uncertainty and 
                instability and protect against recession risk. To quote the 
                McAlvany report, “Gold is the ultimate investment for capital 
                preservation.”<br>
                <br>
                Demand for gold is widely spread around the world. East Asia, 
                the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East accounted for 72 
                per cent of the demand in 2007. Out of this 55 per cent is 
                attributable to five countries - India, Italy, Turkey, USA and 
                China. Each of these markets is driven by a different set of 
                socio-economic and cultural factors. Rapid demographic and other 
                socio-economic changes in many of the key consuming nations have 
                resulted in a favourable demand for this metal.<br>
                <br>
                Markets such as India and China, where gold ownership has 
                largely been confined to jewellery are easing barriers against 
                investing in bullion. A combination of factors, including a 
                weakening dollar is helping to drive gold prices higher.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The macro picture</b><br>
                <img border="0" src="indepth11.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="194" height="279">Gold jewellery accounts for around three-quarters of the overall 
                gold demand. In the 12 months to December 2007, this amounted to 
                $54bn, making jewellery one of the world’s largest categories of 
                consumer goods. In terms of retail value, the USA is the largest 
                market for gold jewellery, whereas India is the largest consumer 
                in volume terms, accounting for 25 per cent of demand in 2007. 
                Generally, jewellery demand is driven by a combination of 
                affordability and desirability by consumers, and tends to rise 
                during periods of price stability or gradually rising prices, 
                and declines in periods of price volatility. A steadily rising 
                price reinforces the inherent value of gold jewellery, which is 
                an intrinsic part of its desirability.<br>
                <br>
                Gold investment can take many forms, and some investors may 
                choose to combine two or more of these for flexibility. The 
                distinction between buying physical gold and gaining exposure to 
                movements in the gold price is not always clear, especially 
                since it has always been possible to invest in bullion without 
                actually taking physical delivery. <br>
                <br>
                There are some fundamental reasons associated to investing in 
                gold. Gold is more than just another commodity, it’s a currency. 
                It is a currency that evolved in the marketplace over the last 
                5,000 years. Gold and silver are the only currencies not created 
                and controlled by governments. All of today’s other currencies 
                are ‘fiat’ currencies, which means they do not represent 
                anything tangible but are only worth something due to government 
                decree (namely legal tender laws). All fiat currencies in the 
                past have ended up worth very little, collapsing into 
                hyperinflation or threatening to do so. All of today’s fiat 
                currencies have been currencies for less than 34 years (all 
                government currencies were convertible to gold until 1971). The 
                rate of creation of such currencies accelerated in 1995, leading 
                to today’s worldwide bubble burst in asset prices. Returning to 
                currencies backed by gold is practical. Even the possibility 
                that it might happen will cause the value of gold to rise 
                considerably. Gold is rapidly gaining as the falling US dollar 
                continues to destroy the trust in fiat currencies. </font>

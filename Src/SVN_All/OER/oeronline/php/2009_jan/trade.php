                of Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Office</b><br>

                <img border="0" src="trade.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="302">Monday, December 15, 2008, is a landmark for Taiwan, as it ended 
                a nearly six-decade ban on the island nation’s regular links 
                with China. This has opened a new era of direct air and shipping 
                services with the mainland savings millions of dollars for 
                people on both the sides. The opening up of the regular links 
                between China also means that Taiwan is slowly emerging from the 
                shadows of political tensions that have plagued Taipei’s trade 
                and economic relations with other countries. The opening up of 
                the air and sea links between China and Taiwan will greatly help 
                Omanis, as they can just hop over to Taiwan quickly for a day 
                time visit from China and finalise business deals and buy 
                Taiwanese goods. No longer do Omani businessmen have to take 
                costly detours via Macau or Hong Kong to go to Taiwan.<br>
                <br>
                Although Taiwan’s bilateral relationship with Oman is not often 
                in the limelight, the two-way trade between Taiwan and Oman has 
                shown marked improvements over the years and last year it grew 
                by 50 per cent crossing the billion mark. Among the large 
                exports from Taiwan include chemicals, iron and steel, 
                electrical lighting, plastics, electronic equipments, automobile 
                spares etc. Imports from Oman to Taiwan include oil and gas, 
                metals, fish and fish products, etc. “Sometimes growing slowly 
                is a good sign. We had established our office in Oman nearly 30 
                years ago and our growth signs are good. We can give it a push 
                and it can easily cross the 100 per cent mark,” says Jackson T C 
                Lee, representative, Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Office while 
                talking about Taiwan’s trade relations with Oman. “The opening 
                up of the air and sea links is certainly an important day for us 
                and has many tangible benefits,” says a visibly pleased Lee.<br>
                <br>
                <b>New strengths</b><br>
                The month of November 2008 saw the Taiwan External Trade 
                Development Council (TAITRA) leading a technological and 
                industrial-oriented trade mission to Muscat. The mission, 
                comprising 22 companies held business meetings to explore the 
                prospects of trade and cooperation here in industries such as 
                electrical equipment, solar energy, communication equipment, 
                auto parts, machinery and construction. “Taiwan has 
                traditionally been a market leader in electronic equipment 
                especially computer hardware and we continue in this position 
                but we want to explore new avenues in Oman, especially in 
                aqua-farming, downstream of petrochemicals like manufacture of 
                plastics and technology transfer,” says Lee.<br>
                <br>
                Taiwan’s technology expertise, which can be used by Oman comes 
                across in a number of areas. The country has a lot of expertise 
                in construction like building oil refineries etc. In the 
                downstream petrochemicals industry, Taiwan has the technology 
                for manufacturing plastic boards (for buildings), helmets, 
                covers of car batteries etc. According to Lee, “As the Sultanate 
                of Oman is pursuing a policy of diversification of the national 
                economy realising that it is not wise to depend upon oil, the 
                black gold, it will be a good idea if Omanis can rope in the 
                technology that Taiwan has to offer in manufacturing, renewable 
                sources of energy like solar and wind, etc.<br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="trade1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="382">Referring to the global financial slowdown and Oman’s investment 
                climate, Lee quips that when the sky is falling it is the tall 
                people who will die first. In this context, Oman has shielded 
                itself because of its conservative policies unlike some of its 
                neighbours who grew like economic giants and fell down. 
                “Leadership is important and Oman under His Majesty Sultan 
                Qaboos bin Said has witnessed remarkable stability and still 
                presents good opportunities for investments,” says Lee. Apart 
                from its strengths in technology, Taiwan has a huge pool of 
                skilled manpower as it has a population of 23 million, ten times 
                that of Oman with a GDP of $383.3bn. Lee emphasises that if the 
                Omani government can set up joint ventures with companies from 
                Taiwan in the aqua-farming sector then both countries will stand 
                to gain a lot. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Aqua-farming joint venture</b><br>
                Taiwan has had a thriving aqua-farming industry since 1991 and 
                Lee feels that his country can provide the know-how and manpower 
                to Oman. Since aqua-farming is labour intensive, hundreds of 
                jobs will be created and the fisheries sector, which is a 
                non-oil activity in Oman, will get a big boost. “All our 
                technology is low-cost unlike the western countries. We are a 
                medium sized friend from whom Oman can benefit,” Lee states, as 
                a matter of fact. “Taiwan considers Oman as a very important 
                investment destination. If Taiwanese can go to India and other 
                countries with their money bags seeking investments, they might 
                very well come to Oman which is a very interesting market. But 
                for this, government of Oman has to iron out the major 
                challenges in the labour market,” observes Lee while talking 
                about strengthening the investment relations. Taiwan’s real 
                growth in GDP averaged about 8 per cent during the past three 
                decades. With its dynamic capitalist, export-driven economy and 
                gradually decreasing state involvement in investment and trade, 
                Taiwan’s economic road ahead is bright and wide. </font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

                drive is partly meant to counter adverse effects of the global

                devote more resources to solve local economic challenges rather 
                than address international problems.<br>
                <br>
                African officials made their presence felt recently at two 
                conferences held in Qatar and Bahrain. Several African leaders 
                attended the UN-sponsored event entitled “Follow-up 
                International Conference on Financing for Development to Review 
                the Implementation of the Monetary Consensus” that ended on 
                December 2, 2008 in the Qatari capital of Doha. The conference 
                was meant to address the goal of development in poor countries 
                through trade, aid and debt relief. These issues were agreed 
                upon during the first such conference held in Mexico in 2002. 
                However, the gathering has all but failed to achieve its aim 
                partly due to the complexities surrounding the ensuing financial 
                crisis.<br>
                <br>
                <b>A tale of two regional conferences<br>
                </b>Except for French President Nicolas Sarkozy, western leaders 
                stayed away from the Doha meeting. Strangely enough, even 
                leaders of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank opted 
                to shun the conference, ostensibly to avoid making specific 
                commitments to poor African nations. Yet, several African head 
                of states attended the conference hoping to secure financial 
                commitments from wealthy countries in general and members of 
                Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in particular.<br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="close1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="196" height="296">In addition, officials and business leaders from Africa actively 
                took part at the “Strengthening GCC-Africa Co-operation in the 
                Gulf,” arranged by Crans Montana Forum Middle East in Manama. 
                Several countries sent ministers of tourism to the gathering 
                apparently to attract visitors from the GCC to explore Africa’s 
                tourism potential. Still, others sent top officials from food, 
                industry and energy sectors hoping to attract GCC investments in 
                specific sectors. At the end, participants decided to set up a 
                joint Africa-GCC council aimed at encouraging the setting up of 
                joint projects and sharing expertise. In particular, the deal 
                translates into African countries seeking investments from 
                investors in numerous fields including infrastructure projects 
                in the vast continent.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Potential of the telecom sector<br>
                </b>Amongst all the sectors, African nations have managed to 
                attract GCC investments in the telecommunications sector in 
                particular, and for good reason. Telecommunication companies 
                from the GCC have been keen to invest in Africa because of its 
                unexplored potential. The continent boasts of 965mn people, in 
                turn representing about 14 per cent of global population. Yet, 
                African countries are not known for having outstanding 
                penetrations rates in mobile, fixed line and the Internet. The 
                International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a UN-agency, had 
                projected that the number of mobile subscribers in Africa could 
                have reached 278mn in 2008.<br>
                <br>
                Etisalat Telecommunications Corporation (Etisalat) leads fellow 
                GCC firms with regards to committing resources for Africa. In 
                2006, a consortium led by Etisalat won a third concession for a 
                third mobile operator in Egypt through a deal valued at $2.89bn. 
                Etisalat also has an 82.5 per cent share of Canar, which in 2004 
                secured a 15-year deal to offer mobile services in Sudan. In 
                2008, the UAE firm increased its stake in Atlantique Telecom 
                from 70 to 82 per cent, as part of its efforts to boost its 
                presence in Africa. Atlantique Telecom operates mobile services 
                in seven countries: Ivory Coast, Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon, 
                Niger, Togo, and the Central African Republic. In addition, 
                Etisalat has a 10-year management contract with the company that 
                expires in 2015. The UAE government owns 60 per cent of Etisalat 
                with the rest of shares being traded publically. Clearly, the 
                UAE authorities must approve investment opportunities.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Eyeing SWFs<br>
                </b>
                <img border="0" src="close2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="200">To be sure, the African attention focuses on making the 
                continent a natural choice for sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) 
                emerging from GCC states. The SWF of the six-nation GCC amounts 
                to $1.5trn, of which $875bn belongs to the UAE alone. The GCC 
                states managed to amass exceptional financial resources on the 
                back of firm oil prices. Undoubtedly, oil prices dropped in the 
                second half of 2008, on the back of global economic recession in 
                the aftermath of sub-prime problem in the US.<br>
                <br>
                Happily, Africa continues to entice larger investment amounts at 
                large, suggesting growing confidence in the continent’s 
                potential. Statistics suggest that African countries are 
                becoming increasingly popular destinations for foreign direct 
                investments (FDI). According to the World Investment Report 
                2008, issued by the World Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 
                African countries attracted around $53bn worth of FDI in 2007 
                versus $46bn in 2006 and $30bn in 2005. Albeit, the amounts do 
                not carry weight per se, representing less than three per cent 
                of total FDI inflows last year. Nevertheless, the figures 
                suggest a positive trend of FDI inflows, in turn focusing on 
                developing farm, fisheries and tourism industries.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Overcoming chronic challenges</b><br>
                Nevertheless, African nations have the daunting task of 
                overcoming chronic problems like corruption which are hindering 
                its business prospects. Transparency International rates African 
                states as the most corrupt countries in the world. Somalia ranks 
                the worst nation on 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). 
                Congo Democratic Republic, Equatorial Guinea besides Guinea, 
                Chad and Sudan are grouped amongst 10 worst performers in the 
                survey. Yet, occupying No. 36 on CPI, Botswana secured the best 
                result for Africa amongst 180 nations reviewed for the annual 
                survey.<br>
                <br>
                CPI rating depends on results of 13 surveys. Reviewed economies 
                earn points based on perceptions expressed by business and 
                academic professionals concerning ways of doing business in 
                various countries. The respondents, which include local and 
                expatriate residents, provide views about possible corrupt 
                practices involving public officials about winning business 
                preferences such as contracts. African authorities need to make 
                the continent a safe place for business partly through solving 
                local problems, but the prospects remain dim. Late last year, 
                some 400 people lost their lives in Nigeria in clashes involving 
                Muslims and Christians disputing results of a local election. 
                Africa has the opportunity of enticing SWFs from the GCC, but 
                the countries must do their homework. More than 190 countries 
                worldwide seek foreign investments, in turn intended to address 
                economic challenges such as economic growth and job creation and 
                Africa will need to prove its credentials to gets its fair share 
                of this deal. </font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

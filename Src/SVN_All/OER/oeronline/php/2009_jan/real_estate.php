                    valued over 10,000 properties over Oman…and still growing<br>
                    <br>
                    Thirty minutes into the conversation and you realise, why Al 
                    Habib &amp; Co, is perched at the very top, when compared to 
                    peers in the business. It’s the courage, confidence and 
                    clear vision of the Chairman, Ali Malallah Habib Al Lawati, 
                    which have helped propel Al Habib, into a premier real 
                    estate agency in Oman. <br>
                    <br>
                    Few would like to move from a secure government job, into 
                    un-chartered waters, but this was not so for Ali. “My father 
                    always told me, one needs more freedom – freedom to think 
                    and freedom to act. Which is why perhaps, a job would never 
                    bring out the best in me,” he says. After graduating from 
                    the University of Cairo, he worked as an economic researcher 
                    with the Directorate of General Planning. However, the 
                    courage, enterprise, and his father’s words compelled him to 
                    start a small consultancy firm – which subsequently went on 
                    to become Al Habib.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Something about the real estate sector fascinated me. When 
                    I went to Europe, I was impressed with the high standards of 
                    the estate agents. I thought of applying these best 
                    practices to Oman as well,” says Ali. But, when you ask him 
                    why the real estate sector; he is clear, that he liked the 
                    sector and saw immense scope for improvement. “I had just 
                    graduated in business from University and I had the idea 
                    about a business that depended on selling properties. I 
                    recognised that the real estate sector in Oman consisted of 
                    a mix of small brokers and large landlords, all operating 
                    independently of one another.<br>
                    <br>
                    “I saw a gap in the market for professional, reliable and 
                    personal real estate services and wanted to develop, ‘model 
                    real estate company’ ,” he says. This vision has 
                    transformed, Al Habib, into the Sultanate’s largest and most 
                    professionally managed real estate services company over 
                    three decades now. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Envying statistics </b><br>
                    The company began modestly with a 20 sq feet office, a 
                    telephone and a table. However, the chairman did have the 
                    ambition and determination to succeed. Today, Al Habib has 
                    1200 employees, manages 2500 dwellings, and has helped in 
                    renting over 40,000 properties all over Oman.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="real2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="199" height="209">The first big deal is always special. Ali still loves to 
                    recollect and cherish those memories. “I built a house for 
                    the Pakistani ambassador at Qurum. I remember charging 
                    RO1200. Today, my parents live in the same house,” he 
                    proudly says.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ali is very reluctant to talk about his strengths. “I would 
                    say it’s my ability to motivate, imbibe values of trust and 
                    respect, yet accountability, with colleagues. You learn a 
                    few things at the University, but you do find a lot to learn 
                    from practical experiences as well. I believe, I am also 
                    able to build partnerships with key stakeholders, like 
                    financers, employees, clients etc. I am able to articulate a 
                    clear vision as well,” he says.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ali slices time, between work and leisure. He works between 
                    9am and 2pm, devoting time also for activities like reading 
                    and exercising. “I would say it helps you to relax and stay 
                    calm. I also listen to soft music and do watch movies,” he 
                    says. Ali does not strictly get into the micro aspects of 
                    the business, but maintains an overall purview of affairs, 
                    while arriving at a consensus on decisions. “I always 
                    delegate responsibilities. People in the company have been 
                    able to take-up these responsibilities. I have a good team 
                    in place and I am proud of the people with Al Habib,” he 
                    says.<br>
                    <br>
                    Habib is a well-heeled traveller, visiting several places 
                    across the globe, mostly mixing work and pleasure on visits. 
                    “I have travelled to a lot of places. Somehow, I have missed 
                    Russia and Japan. In the future, I plan to visit these 
                    places, ” he says.<br>

                    <br>
                    Al Habib has created several prestigious landmarks within 
                    the Sultanate. “Over the last three decades Al Habib has 
                    developed a number of landmark buildings including the Ernst 
                    &amp; Young Commercial Centre, City Residence Apartments, Centre 
                    Point in Muscat and in Salalah, and the Salalah Sanitary and 
                    Drainage headquarters amongst others,” <br>
                    <br>
                    An equally impressive ongoing projects, will add to the 
                    elite list of completed ones. Some of the prestigious 
                    projects underway include, the four-star Park Inn Hotel in 
                    Muscat and residential developments such as the Lavendar 
                    Apartments and Canary Villas as well as 40,000 sq mtr mixed 
                    commercial and residential block for the Ministry of Defense 
                    pension fund.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Economic turmoil</b><br>
                    Ask him on the present economic turmoil, and he seems hardly 
                    fazed, though he admits that it does impact business. “The 
                    economic crisis is impacting all areas of business and 
                    industry. Sector wise, the current economic situation is 
                    creating problems as there is a lack of liquidity which 
                    affects investments and construction. However, due to our 
                    foresight and wise investments we have not been badly 
                    affected,” says Ali. <br>
                    <br>
                    According to him, it’s still a good time to be in the real 
                    estate market. “I still think it’s a good time to be 
                    involved in the real estate sector. Real estate is a big and 
                    wide-spread industry, so overall I consider that it’s always 
                    a good time to be involved in it. The only question is where 
                    geographically, and in which segment of the industry i.e. 
                    mutual funds, direct investment, development, contracting, 
                    building materials, marketing, or speculation in barren 
                    land, etc,” he says <br>
                    <br>
                    As far as the future plans are concerned, there’s no 
                    ambiguity in the vision. “Regardless of new comers appearing 
                    in the market, our aim is to retain our position in Oman – 
                    as a well-structured and organised business group leading 
                    the sector. In addition, I would like to diversify 
                    geographically, possibly looking at other industry sectors, 
                    with an increased involvement in investments and charity 
                    work. Finally, I’d like to build on the family involvement, 
                    with more family members continuing to serve the group for 
                    the future,” says Ali.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
                    Clearly, the Chairman has a vision and knows to lead. As 
                    John Maxwell rightly said: “A leader is one who knows the 
                    way, goes the way and shows the way.”

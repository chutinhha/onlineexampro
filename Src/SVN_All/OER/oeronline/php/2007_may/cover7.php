<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Oman Oil Marketing Company scores a fast turnaround in the second half of the 
year, and now eyes capitalising on 35% revenue growth in 2005</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover_7b.jpg" width="175" height="220" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Oman Oil Marketing Company’s performance would have been better had it not been 
that the first half of 2006 saw the oil and gas industry struggling with supply 
issues, with normalcy only being restored in May. In 2006, the company delivered 
a net profit of RO4 million, an increase of 26.7 per cent over the RO3.2 million 
reported in 2005. This has been possible because of the following:<br>
<br>
<b>Retail:</b> The year 2006 was the most successful ever on the retail front, with 
record breaking sales contributing handsomely to the company’s turnover and net 
profit. It also saw the highest level of investment activity in the company’s 
history. Despite supplier related fuel shortages in the first five months of the 
year, volumes increased 19 per cent from 2005. The gross margin per litre of 
fuel also exhibited a very similar trend, due mainly to a change in the fuel 
mix, aggressive growth in the fuel card business and increased number of 
stations on the dealer owned company operated (DOCO) model. The company’s 
efficiency improved further, with average throughput) per site increasing to 5.2 
million litres in 2006 from 4.8 million litres in 2005. During the year, nine 
new filling stations were opened (the most in any one year), with three others 
receiving major refurbishments. <br>
<br>
<b>Commercial Fuels:</b> The commercial fuels business continued to grow, registering a 
handsome 23 per cent growth in 2006. The growth came even as the business faced 
a number of challenges including non-availability of products in the required 
quantum during the first five months of the year (similar to retail) and 
non-availability of experienced Omani drivers the 100 per cent Omanisation in 
this area. The business continued to focus on building long-term relationships 
with its customers to grow with them as also targeting new customers. An area of 
concern continues to be the high receivables (number of days of sales). <br>
<br>
<b>Aviation:</b> Seeb International Airport, the largest in the Sultanate, experienced 
a significant growth in passengers and fuel sales during 2006. Overall, the 
company’s aviation volumes increased by 39 per cent over last year even though 
airport volumes grew only 30 per cent. This sector’s fortune is closely linked 
to the number of flights coming into and fuelling in the Sultanate. The future 
of Oman as a refuelling destination will be closely linked to the pricing 
structure and it is with this in mind that preliminary discussions have taken 
place to make Oman a competitive location. Success in this area will realise 
significant revenues for the country and the company. <br>
<br>
An area of concern is bidding at sub-optimal prices by several of Oman Oil’s 
competitors in an effort to boost their market share. Oman Oil, with the active 
involvement of its marketing partner Air BP, is addressing this through measures 
which balance customer mix, the range to which customers fly, ability to service 
customers on time (enabling turnaround of aircraft), leveraging on relationships 
and its own margins, as it believes that in the longer run value for both the 
parties involved can be created only this way. <br>
<br>
<b>Lubricants:</b> The year 2006 was a turbulent year for the company’s lubricants 
business, with three price increases during the period resulting from a 
significant increase in base oil prices, which make up 80 per cent of the cost 
of a lubricant. These price increases had to be passed onto customers and 
resulted in some customers shifting to cheaper brands leading to a 9 per cent 
drop in volumes, especially in the B-to-B segment.<br>
<br>
Oman Oil is introducing its own brand of lubricants exclusively for the export 
market. The brand and pack designs, and sourcing arrangements have been 
finalised and work is continuing on creating a distribution network in the 
targeted countries. Dedicated resources for this have been assigned. The year 
2007 will see the fruits of this initiative. <br>
<br>
<b>Customer Service Centre:</b> A customer service centre was opened during the year 
with state-of-the-art equipment and dedicated facilities and resources.<br>
<br>
<b>Storage and Distribution:</b> The company has initiated changes in its ‘ways of 
working’ for the logistics and terminal operations, which is expected to 
significantly increase the utilisation of the existing storage infrastructure 
and distribution fleet. This initiative, started in late 2006, is expected to 
reduce distribution cost, the single largest cost component after product cost. Sohar Refinery commenced despatches to marketers in early 2007 and this is also 
expected to ease the pressure on storage infrastructure. <br>
<br>
<b>Balance Sheet </b> <br>
Oman Oil’s balance sheet remains strong with continued focus on debtors and cash 
management. Whilst overall trade debtors have increased with the increase in the 
sales, it is heartening to note that the average number of debtor days remains 
at 48 days. More importantly, the age profile of the debtors has changed with a 
reduction in the overall age of debtors following the multi-pronged approach 
initiated by the company in 2005. It has also adopted a largely non-judgmental 
approach, which is based on historic trends and tends to be on the conservative 
side, in the methodology used for provisioning of doubtful debts. This has 
resulted in a charge of RO458,490 during the year to the P&amp;L account. This gets 
adjusted on a monthly basis depending on the status of the debtors’ accounts. In 
fact, in the last quarter of 2006 there was a credit of RO120,000 on this count 
due to recoveries from accounts already provided for.

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Outlook</b><br>
The company has placed itself in a strong position for the future. On the retail 
front, it has adequate permits in hand and applications in the pipeline to 
facilitate building for 2007 and 2008; fuel cards will be the growth driver. The 
launch of 
‘Omanoil’ branded lubricants in the overseas markets is also expected to drive 
growth; at the same time, the continued viability of the existing lubricants 
business will need to be tightly monitored. <br>
<br>
Relationships already in place and leveraging on them as also independent 
efforts to develop new ones will help drive growth in the commercial fuels 
segment, aided by the increased economic activity in the country. The aviation 
industry and business, the company believes, will see strong growth in the 
future with the planned expansions of the Muscat and Salalah airports.</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Reflecting the fast growth in the oil marketing sector, Oman Oil Marketing 
continues to perform well. Despite the supply issues faced, segments like 
retail, commercial fuels and aviation grew over last year whilst maintaining/ 
improving margins in most businesses. Overall volumes grew by 23 per cent over 
2005 whilst the sales turnover increased disproportionately by 35 per cent due 
to the full-year effect of gas oil price increase and increase in international 
aviation fuel pricing. The company announced 50 per cent growth in its first 
quarter 2007 profits from a 38 per cent growth in sales. From a stock valuation 
perspective though, the current year growth appears to have been factored in. –

        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: -20px">
        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman Oil Marketing Company has reported impressive growth of 37.9 per cent in 
revenue to RO34.221 million for the first quarter of year 2007. As a result, its 
net profits have jumped by 50.1 per cent to RO1.025 million. On annualised 
basis, EPS works out to 64 baiza, which is 15.7X its market price of RO1.002. 
The company has reported its book value per share at 203 baiza, which translates 
to price to book value of 4.9X. Recently, the company has been short listed for 
the pre-qualification stage of the bidding exercise to acquire Pakistan State 
Oil (PSO), the country’s oil major. We believe the company is well placed in a 
growing sector with initiatives to broaden its business out of the country, in 
Yemen and Pakistan. However with Oman Oil Company’s disinvestment on cards, the 
stock’s liquidity is likely to increase and may put pressure on the stock in the 
short term. – <b>GIS</b></font></li>

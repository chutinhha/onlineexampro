<b>A sixth bank has appeared on Oman’s financial horizon after 12 years. Abhijit 
Sinha checks out CEO Nani B. Javeri’s start-up USP of ‘not just selling a 
product but also a solution with that product’<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="special4.jpg" width="250" height="199" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">January 1, 2006 – a group of Omani investors are given the go-ahead by the 
Central Bank of Oman (CBO) to set up a new bank with a capital of RO 100 
million, of which half is paid up and half will be called within a three-year 
period. The founders’ committee meets in October, and a decision is taken to 
launch an initial public offering (IPO) for RO 20 million, divesting 
approximately 40 per cent of the initial capital base. The Capital Market 
Authority (CMA) clears the IPO (at face value of RO 1) on November 25, and the 
issue is oversubscribed six times by the time it closes on March 5, 2007.<br>
<br>
On April 9 this year, Bank Sohar is launched as the sixth commercial bank in 
Oman. Prior to that, at an AGM held at Crowne Plaza Hotel, shareholders elect a 
seven-member board of directors – with Sheikh Hilal Bin Hamood Al Maamari as 
chairman, and Dr Mohammed Abdul Aziz Kalmoor as deputy chairman. The other board 
members are Abdullah Humaid al Maamari, Hussain Al Shalwani, Hamed al Rawahy, 
Taher al Amri and Salem Al Mashaiki.<br>
<br>
The first new bank in the country in 12 years, Bank Sohar is all set to 
capitalise on the surge in financial liquidity and brimming investment 
potentials in the country. “We are starting with the ambition of being a 
universal bank, covering most of the areas other than investment and brokering, 
which we will do separately. But we plan to gradually build ourselves into a 
full-fledged commercial bank,” says Nani B. Javeri, Chief Executive Officer. 
Targeting risk assessment is the strategy – thus carving out a niche for the 
bank in Oman. “We have deliberately given risk a very high profile, as we 
believe this is very important – and increasingly more as the world has seen – 
particularly for a new bank,” says Javeri.<br>
<br>
<b>No legacy baggage</b><br>
But Bank Sohar does not want to be seen as an easy mark for anyone seeking a 
loan, as no application can be passed by a line manager. The Head of Corporate 
Banking cannot sign an approval facility without getting the clearance from the 
head of risk assessment, in this case from HV Seshadri, the senior-most deputy 
general manager who assesses enterprise risks – be it credit risk, operational 
risk, market risk or reputational risk. For all practical purposes, he is the 
second in command as there is no general manager yet. From there, the 
application goes to the credit committee, where the head of risk assessment says 
whether it is bankable or not.<br>
<br>
The corporate banking division is another large area for the bank and it 
handles:</font><ul>

</ul>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Javeri is confident that coming after 12 years, the new bank will “jolt and wake 
people up a little bit.” The advantage of a start-up is having no legacy 
baggage, and that’s the focus of this new bank – which wants to fill gaps in the 
banking scene in Oman in next three years.<br>
<br><b>Risk vs opportunities</b><br>“Our focus is SME, a segment that’s somewhat neglected in Oman as people have 
found it to be of high risk and stayed away from it. We believe there’s a huge 
opportunity in this sector. The rest of the world has also seen it, but they 
were pressurised for different reasons to get into SME – which, by nature, is a 
higher risk business. They were pushed into this primarily because margins of 
large corporates came under huge pressure – and they found that they were not 
getting any returns on the huge money they were lending. So, there was a 
disintermediation where corporates could borrow directly and not have to go 
through the intermediation of any bank. This pushed the banks gradually into the 
SME sector,” says the Bank Sohar CEO.<br>
<br>
Javeri believes there’s a huge opportunity in SME banking, “as it creates lots 
of jobs and plays a huge role in the development of the country.” With huge 
projects in the pipeline, there will be downstream opportunities for the SMEs – 
and that’s where he will like the new bank to participate actively. “SME will be 
one of our bigger focus areas,” he affirms. But that’s not the USP of Bank 
Sohar. “In every market, there are opportunities, and we do recognise it’s got a 
degree of risk which is higher than the corporate segment. But we believe that 
we have the management skills to understand – and manage – these risks,” he 
stresses.<br>
<br>So what’s the thrust area of the latest entrant in the commercial banking sector 
of Oman? Identifying gaps in the market, says Javeri – some of which are in the 
“linked knowledge base sectors,” where the bank is not just selling a product 
but also a solution with that product.<br>
<br><b>Solution provider</b><br>A consistently high efficient service and need-based products which give 
solutions to the customer, that’s the target area of Bank Sohar. For instance, 
treasury will not be just buying and selling spot. People, especially the SMEs, 
want to know how, and where, to invest their money – or to cover themselves from 
certain risks.<br>
<br>“We will be giving them solutions of how to manage their business better,” says 
the ebullient CEO, who plans to expand from one branch to a countrywide network 
of 15-20 branches in the next six years. By the end of 2007, there will be at 
least five branches. All this will, of course, be subject to CBO approval.<br>
<br>Core areas for Bank Sohar are the three investment arms – treasury, SME and 
consumer/retail banking. The consumer banking division has housing and personal 
loans sections, while private banking is within retail banking. To differentiate 
between the high networth customers and the low-end customers, the bank will be 
encouraging alternate channels of delivery like SMS, internet, ATMs and call 
banking. The middle group – the largest community of customers – will be 
serviced from the main branch.<br>
<br><b>Alliances and syndication<br></b>Javeri says there’s enough room for a sixth bank in the economy which is growing 
at an exponential rate. The oil and gas revenue surplus is having a catalytic 
effect on manufacturing, tourism, retail and exports.<br>
<br>“Banks are the engines of growth. Get the savings and deploy them as 
investments. Overseas loans, to a very significant extent, are financing the 
mega-projects coming up in Oman. That’s because we can’t expect to do it all 
ourselves. The banking assets are only about RO5 billion, whereas the projects 
are three to four times that number. These are the opportunities for banks to 
participate – not competitively but more as alliances,” he adds.<br>
<br>Bank Sohar is looking at opportunities to do business with different banks and 
financial institutions, acknowledges the bank’s CEO. Reluctant to talk about 
investment alliances, as the start-up is not even a month old, Javeri says the 
bank has a fair amount of money to invest and will be participating in 
syndicates. “We will put the money into our lending portfolios judiciously, 
which could be across the GCC. So, we are talking to loan syndicates, banks that 
participate in loan syndicates, and, of course, corporates, to borrow from us,” 
is all that can be elicited from the canny banker.<br>
<br>Parting shot from the Bank Sohar CEO: “The problems Oman’s banking sector faced 
in the year 2000 have largely gone. But in a growth phase, banks have to be even 
more careful than before, as one tends to take more risks at times of rapid 
growth. The CBO has some valid concerns about consumer lending. There has to be 
a balance between judicious and injudicious lending. Banks do have an advisorial 
role to play. Bank Sohar will lend money not only in a judicious manner but also 
to prevent people from over-extending themselves.” </font></p>

specialist in the banking and insurance world, and has quite a few tricks up his 
sleeve for this venture – his third in a career spanning four decades . He 
started with Grindlays Bank in India way back in 1966 and worked for a marathon 
32 years – of which five were in the UK. After the ANZ group acquired Grindlays 
in 1984 he was posted to Melbourne (Australia), the ANZ headquarters, for two 
separate assignments.<br>
      <br>Of these 32 years, Javeri was general manager for 18 long years, acquiring 
skill-sets in corporate banking, retail banking and the human resource division 
where he “just about covered all important positions.” The opportunity to head a 
start-up, as Managing Director of Times Bank of Bennett &amp; Coleman group (of 
which Times of India is the flagship), pulled him back to India in 1998. “They 
had run into some problems between 1994 and 1998. So, it was a start-up as well 
as a turnaround for me. I saw it as a challenging assignment that lasted 20 
months. During this period we did much better. Established the bank as a retail 
base, and also had a successful IPO,” reminisces Javeri. Then the HDFC Bank 
acquired Times Bank, and he got an offer to stay on with Bennett &amp; Coleman 
group. But the travel bug bit again and brought him to Oman, with the Oman 
International Bank, for yet another 20-month stint from April 2000 to November 
2001.<br>
      <br>Back again to India to head a new venture – Birla Sun Life Insurance Company, a 
joint venture between Aditya Birla group of India and the Sun Life Financials of 
Canada. In five years, says Javeri, he established Birla Sun Life as “a well 
known brand, as well as a successful insurance company, in a highly competitive 
environment.”<br>
      <br>“My wife and I came in October 2006, and I joined the Foundation Committee of 
the bank. It’s an exciting opportunity. In fact, if it hadn’t been Oman I 
probably wouldn’t have taken up the assignment,” adds he.</font></td>

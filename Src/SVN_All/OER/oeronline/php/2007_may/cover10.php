<img border="0" src="cover_10b.jpg" width="175" height="218" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The year 2006 was another successful year for OIB, which stood in the 10th 
position in 2005, and was able to retain its position in the Top 10. This 
reflected the huge growth seen across the banking sector in Oman. The Bank 
attributed the success to its strategy of providing superior value to its 
customers. <br>
<br>
<b>The year that was <br>
</b>Key measures of performance and efficiency continued to show improvement. Net 
interest income increased by 6.6 per cent, from RO32.512 million in 2005 to 
RO34.666 million in 2006. Other Income of RO10.492 million, showed an increase 
of 21.5 per cent. “This improvement is the result of our efforts to increase the 
volume of fee-based activity. Our cost management and productivity improvement 
initiatives continue to yield positive results,” according the company’s annual 
report. Operating costs declined by 0.2 per cent and as a result, the cost to 
income ratio improved to 38.9 per cent for the current year as compared to 42.8 
per cent for the previous year. Accordingly, the Bank’s operating profit 
increased from RO23.548 million in 2005 to RO27.599 million in 2006, a growth of 
17.2 per cent.<br>
<br>
The Bank had another successful year in recovering non-performing loans with the 
impact of recovery amounting to RO5.431 million. Accordingly, the bank achieved 
a net profit of RO26.195 million for the year 2006, compared to RO22.028 million 
for the year 2005, an increase of 18.9 per cent. In the light of these results, 
the Board of Directors has proposed a cash dividend of 21 per cent and a stock 
dividend of 10 per cent to be distributed in 2007.<br>
<br>
The loans and advances stood at RO516.856 million as on December 31, 2006, 
compared to RO512.590 million on the same date previous year, recording a modest 
increase of 0.8 per cent. The focus during the year has been to increase the 
project finance loans in line with its strategy of growing low-risk assets. 
Total deposits stood at RO684.816 million as on December 31, 2006, compared to 
RO659.244 million on December 31, 2005, representing a growth of 3.9 per cent. 
Loans and advances continue to form a significant part of the total assets and 
represent 56.2 per cent of the total assets. The Bank’s loan book is primarily 
concentrated in Oman with 99 per cent of the loans in Oman and the balance 
represents exposure in India, Pakistan and other GCC countries.<br>
<br>
Internationally, in India the Bank’s strategy of focusing on recovery of problem 
loans, limiting asset growth, improving cost of funds and reducing operating 
costs continues. The results continue to be encouraging with a strong 
improvement in the operating income. The company has also seen positive 
developments in recovering some NPAs. The operations in Pakistan continue to be 
closely managed. OIB has increased the capital base of its operations in 
Pakistan in line with the requirements of the State Bank of Pakistan.<br>
<br>
Total banking credit increased by 20.5 per cent from RO3,896 million in December 
2005 to RO4,695 million in December 2006. During the nine-month period ended 
September 2006 (latest data available), personal loans increased by 14.7 per 
cent and corporate and commercial lending increased by 13.4 per cent.<br>
<br>
The total balance sheet of the Bank stood at RO919.504 million as on December 
31, 2006, compared to RO820.835 million on December 31, 2005. The Bank maintains 
a judicious mix between loans and short-term liquid assets represented by cash 
and balance with central banks, bank placements and treasury bills/CDs. The 
Bank’s capital position continues to be very strong.<br>
<br>
Cash and balances with central banks, treasury bills/CDs and bank placements, 
which are mainly of short-term maturity, are the key components of the Bank’s 
liquidity management activities. Treasury bills/CDs decreased by 26.5 per cent 
to RO60,000 million and bank placements increased by 77.5 per cent to RO246,063 
million. These liquid assets constitute 37.6 per cent of the total assets. 
Placements with banks in Oman, OECD and GCC countries represented 93.5 per cent 
of the total placements.<br>
<br>
Shareholders equity, including current year profit of RO26.195 million, 
increased to RO125.213 million as on December 31, 2006. The Bank’s capital 
adequacy ratio at the end of the year stood at 22.05 per cent.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The year ahead <br>
</b>The outlook for the year 2007 is positive as a result of a number of prudent 
macroeconomic initiatives undertaken by the Government of Oman. The fiscal 
budget for the 2007 has a strong emphasis on growth with a targeted real GDP 
growth rate of 6 per cent. Privatisation and infrastructure development 
continues to be a focus area to achieve economic progress and diversification.<br>
<br>
The initiatives on the gas-based industrial projects are expected to achieve 
further progress during the year. Oman’s entry into World Trade Organisation, 
the GCC Customs Union with a unified external tariff and the Free Trade 
Agreement with the US, will help to achieve better market opportunities and 
encourage intra-Gulf trading. These initiatives should provide enough 
opportunities for the Bank to further improve its business.<br>
<br>
The bank looks to the future with full confidence and optimism. The government 
policies continue to focus on strong<br>
<br>
economic growth with the 2007 fiscal budget targeting a real GDP growth of 6%. 
This, together with the solid business franchise that the bank enjoys in Oman, 
and the market share gained over the past years, leads us to believe that Oman 
International Bank will be successful in expanding and developing its business, 
and thereby continuing to contribute to the progress 
of the nation.</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">With a strong control on its operating costs and by growing the fee income side, 
OIB delivered a good performance during 2006. However, the bank faces 
significant threat from the emerging competition, both in terms of attrition and 
loss of market share. OIB registered a negative growth in loan book during 2006 
whereas the other big players like BankMuscat and NBO registered record growth 
		in their loan assets. The stock offers quite attractive valuations due 
		to its high dividend yield and low multiples. However, a clear 
		communication from the firm on its business strategy going forward has 
		become absolutely essential for better investor participation in the 
		stock. – <b>Vision</b><br>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">OIB, the Omani bank with presence in Oman, India and Pakistan, has seen loan 
books remaining almost flat at RO516.856 million during 2006. At the same time, 
the Bank with wide reach throughout the Sultanate enjoys highest level of 
low-cost saving deposits. With increase in liquid assets, the total assets have 
improved by 12 per cent to RO919.504 million. Total customers deposits have 
ended marginally up by 3.9 per cent to RO684.816 million. With 16.6 per cent 
growth in Interests Income and 40.9 per cent jump in Interests expenses, the NII 
		ended up by 6.6 per cent to RO34.666 million. However, with lower 
		operating costs and improvement in other operating income, the Net 
		profits ended up by 18.9 per cent to RO26.195 million. The bank has to 
		articulate a strategy to grow its loan books and strengthen its 
		management. With competition hot in all segments of business, it is high 
		time the bank reacts to the need of the market. Under the prevailing 
		interest scenario, assuming a loan growth of 10 per cent, the bank is 
		estimated to provide a bottom-line growth of 14 per cent, bearing 
		unforeseen circumstances. At current market price of RO2.700, the stock 
		is discounted at 7.5X. We would like watch for the signals. – <b>GIS</b></font></li>

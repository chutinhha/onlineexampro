<b>Year 2006 marks unpredecented business growth for the company with highest ever 
net profit and record sales figures<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover_2b.jpg" width="175" height="218" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The No. 1 company couple of years ago might have to wait a little longer if it 
has to regain the coveted position. Nonetheless, 2006 was a year of 
unprecedented business results, delivering the company’s highest ever-net profit 
after tax and record sales figures.<br>
<br>
The strong economic factors have resulted in the demand for refined petroleum 
products of the company growing significantly during 2006. The supply situation 
remained tight throughout the year and, coupled with shortages of skilled 
drivers for heavy goods vehicle, posed a substantial strain on logistics 
resources, in some instances causing temporary shortages of refined product that 
could be made available to customers.<br>
<br>
The retail business remains the most important portfolio segment for the 
company. During the year, the company opened two retail sites, whilst at 
year-end a further two sites were at final stages of construction. The company 
continues to leverage the success in its innovative launch of the improved fuel 
economy initiative (New Shell Super with Better Mileage), extending it further 
and making it available for regular petrol. This resulted in strong response 
from the customer, with total volume crossing the one billion liters milestone a 
few days before the year-end, making it the fist oil marketing company achieve 
this mark in Oman. Despite the pressure coming from increased number of sites in 
the competitors’ network, the company continued to maintain its overall 
marketing edge as an industry leader with an estimated 50% market share. The 
average throughput per site in 2006 increased to 8.6 million liters when 
compared to 7.5 million liters in 2005. Average gross margins from the 
convenience stores continued to suffer from the negative impact due to higher 
operating costs in Select stores and increase in cost of FMCG supplies. The fuel 
card business grew by 20% during the year following a major product launch a 
year ago improving security and usage features.<br>
<br>
The commercial business benefited from the increased economic activity, albeit 
pricing and competitive terms of trade remain the key factors in this sector. 
This commercial fuels segment remains the pivotal support for 
business-to-business segment of the company. “Our focus to grow and sustain this 
business is a key element of the business strategy in the coming years. Shell 
Oman Marketing will continue to focus on the basics, and operational excellence 
to sustain current profitability whilst differentiating customer value 
propositions in the market to capture fair share of the available 
opportunities,” said Dr Andrew Wood, Chairman, Shell Oman.<br>
<br>
In 2006, jet fuel sales at all airfields in Oman increased by 14% and the volume 
at Seeb Airport was up by 50% due to Gulf Air changing its hub from Abu Dhabi to 
Muscat. Both volume and margin targets were exceeded in the aviation business. 
The company retained 50% of Oman Air business. The company lost a tender 
representing a significant share of its portfolio in May 2006 as a result of the 
yearly tendering exercise, but was able to ensure growth coming from other parts 
of the portfolio.<br>
<br>
The year has also been a successful one for the company’s Lubricants Supply 
Chain LSC division with a total volume growth of 13%. The division also produced 
a record 76.1 million litre of the finished lubricants for the commercial, 
retail, marine and exports businesses. The growth trend is expected to continue 
in 2007, because the demand for Shell lubricants in both the local and export 
markets is very strong. LSC benefited from a number of cost cutting initiatives. 
These initiatives have resulted in total saving in excess of RO400,000. A plant 
expansion study has been conducted in 2006, to upgrade the blending plant 
capacity, which will provide for the increase in volume demand.<br>
<br>
In early 2006, Shell Oman successfully signed off the sales and purchase 
agreement of petroleum products with Oman Refinery Company, sole supplier of 
petroleum products in Oman. The planned lifting of fuels from the new Sohar 
Refinery Company has been delayed from July 2006 to early 2007.<br>
<br>
The company also successfully amended its articles of association to allow for 
an increase in the level of foreign shareholding to 70% from 49% previously. 
This has enabled the company’s share to attract more demand from a wider segment 
of investors within the region.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Outlook<br>
</b>
</font>
<font face="Verdana" size="1">The company has had an excellent performance during 2006. When compared with 
2005, the share price has increased by more than 60 per cent, dividend levels 
are up 20%, turnover has been up by more 23 per cent, and the safety performance 
is demonstrably excellent. However, the competition is expected to remain 
intense in the years to come. It will continue to execute its retain network 
development plan in a robust manner. Some part of the company’s business, like 
supply of international aviation fuels and export lubricants, will be subjected 
to external factors in terms of the prising competitiveness available at other 
international locations.<br>
<br>
The high demand for lubricants across the region will continue to exert pressure 
on the supply and availability of raw materials in the region with the resulting 
impact of higher price as well as supply constraints.<br>
<br>
The fuels market normally follows the economic trend of the country and is thus 
expected to be stable, growing in tandem with the economic activities. Cards 
business will remain competitive and unit margins are expected to be under 
pressure. Managing credit will be an ongoing challenge, in a growing market and 
expanding sales portfolios. New development of road networks and residential 
areas will open up opportunities for addition of new retail sites where these 
are needed and viable major infrastructure projects announced by the government 
previously will see some activities starting out during 2007 and the company 
would like to ensure that it is ready to handle the 
stiff competition.</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Shell Oman Marketing Co. (SOMC) reported substantially higher revenues for 2006 
on the back of increased volumes. The company has witnessed a growth in three of 
the four business segments – retail, B-2-B (commercial) and lubricants. We 
believe SOMC is playing an ‘efficient’ volume game in the oil distribution 
market with higher throughput and lower operating costs. As volume of fuel sales 
increase, the profitability also increases due to the relatively stagnant 
operating costs. On a conservative basis, we expect the company to post an EPS 
of RO0.106 for the full year, FY06. Valuations at current levels could be 
justified considering the fact that the company would maintain high dividend 
payouts. – <b>Vision<br>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">The market leader in oil marketing sector, Shell Oman Marketing registered 
impressive earnings growth of 19.6 per cent to RO8.920 million in FY 2006. The 
company has been aggressive in formulating marketing strategies which has helped 
it to maintain dominant position in the sector with an estimated market share of 
50 per cent. The average through put per site during 2006 improved to 8.6 
million litres compared to 7.5 million litres during 2005. We expect this to 
remain firm during the year due to prevailing economic situation, which is 
buoyant. Healthy growth and sustainable margins in commercial, aviation and 
lubricants business is expected to further augment earnings growth during FY 
2007. We expect the company to register an EPS of 114 baiza for FY 2007, which 
translates to PE (FY07) of 13.1X. Also, the liberal dividend policy of the 
company enhances shareholders value. We have a positive outlook on the company.

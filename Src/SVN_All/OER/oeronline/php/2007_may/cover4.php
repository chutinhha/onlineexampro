<b>It’s an year of renaissance for Renaissance that recorded a healthy 34.32 per 
cent growth with a profitable long-term income base<br>

<br>
<img border="0" src="cover_4b.jpg" width="175" height="219" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Renaissance Services, an Omani multi-national oil &amp; gas services group, has 
consolidated its position at number 4 in the OER 20 for the second year running. 
This achievement comes on the back of three years of strategic transition in 
which the company has delivered a remarkable change programme that has created 
enormous value potential for shareholders.<br>
<br>
In a recent open meeting for investors and analysts, CEO Stephen Thomas 
explained that Renaissance has changed in four fundamental ways: From a pure 
services provider to a company with a healthy balance between major asset-based 
businesses and pure services businesses; From a company with high reliance on 
short-term high-return contracts to a company with long-term sustainable income 
and profit streams; From a company providing diverse multi-faceted services to a 
company with a primary focus on oil &amp; gas services; From a company with market 
leadership positions in primarily Oman-based businesses to an Omani company that 
is becoming increasingly multi-national and proving its international 
competitiveness abroad.<br>
<br>
When asked to summarise the principal successes of this transformation, Thomas 
ticks off an eye-catching list of achievements. “We have delivered an impressive 
growth record for five successive years; we’ve built a sustainable business; 
we’ve grown our home base in Oman and delivered significant international 
expansion; we have successfully focused on quality oil &amp; gas services; and we’ve 
grown and strengthened the
balance sheet.” <br>
<br>
These claims do stand up to close scrutiny. The growth record is plain to see: 
in 2002 Renaissance revenue stood at RO29 million and this has grown 
exponentially year-on-year to the RO142 million achieved in 2006. In the same 
period profits have risen from RO1.6 million to RO14 million. The sustainable 
business is visible in major contracts spanning 10, 15, 20 years and more with 
major oil &amp; gas producers including Agip KCO, BP, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) 
and Shell. The Oman-based business has grown to annual revenues of RO35 million 
in 2006 and this represents 25% of the company’s total revenue, with the balance 
RO107 million being earned from the company’s international expansion. The 
company operated in 39 countries in 2006 and owns businesses from the Gulf to 
the Caspian to the North Sea. The focus on oil &amp; gas is also clear with 72% of 
2006 revenue coming from oil &amp; gas operations. The strengthened balance sheet 
shows equity and reserves increased from RO25 million in 2004 to RO91 million in 
2006 backed by comfortable leverage ratios in spite of significant expansion. 
Over the same period assets have grown from RO18 million to
RO122 million.<br>
<br>
“Renaissance shareholders own a lot of quality assets,” Thomas enthuses. 
Renaissance owns one of the top 10 offshore support vessel fleets in the world; 
has engineering businesses in oil &amp; gas fabrication and afloat ship repair; is a 
leading turnkey contract services provider; and has successful technology, media 
and training businesses.<br>
<br>
So how has this been achieved? “Simple,” says Thomas, “Our people”, and he means 
it. “Every day Renaissance people across all our businesses and markets are out 
there exceeding customer expectations safely and profitably. That is the key.”<br>
<br>
So why has the stock price performed below market in 2006? “We do not manage 
share price,” says Thomas, “That is a matter for the market to decide”. The 
Renaissance stock finished the year at a P/E ratio of 7.26 against the MSM 
average of 11.9. Oil &amp; Gas services companies enjoy even greater multiples in 
many markets throughout the world. But the CEO adds: “What we do manage is the 
transparency and good governance of our business, and as the market begins to 
appreciate our performance and the reality and success of our strategic 
transition we believe there may be a correction in the value perception of our 
stock”.</font></p>

Renaissance’s investment strategy for 2007-09 is focused on three core 
initiatives: Increasing the size and reducing the age profile of its offshore 
support vessel fleet – prudently balancing investment between the fleet engaged 
in high demand spot markets and the fleet engaged in long-term stable contracts 
with major oil and gas producers and operators; developing additional capacity 
and capability in its oil &amp; gas fabrication and ship repair businesses; and 
expanding capacity and geographical spread of its permanent accommodation for 
contractors (PAC) facilities in remote oilfields.<br>
<br>
In 2006, the company has invested RO32.868 million in new assets and it has a 
programme to invest a further RO195.500 million over the next three years. With 
build and lead-in times, these investments begin to contribute significant 
earnings and free cash flow within one to two years from inception. In addition, 
the company has not ruled out making at least one more important acquisition in 
the
oil &amp; gas sector.<br>
<br>
The company also expects the investments made in the past three years will start 
to deliver stronger performance going forward. “Our three years of transition 
are over,” Thomas explains, “I don’t want to get into predicting and managing 
earnings, but in general terms people can see we are now moving into new 
three-year phases of exponential growth in profit”.<br>
<br>
Certainly, Renaissance has shown that it has a robust business model that can 
deliver strong and value-driven performance year on year. It has a clear 
strategy and a focused business plan to deliver a stronger performance in the 
years to come. The chief executive sums it up succinctly, “The 2006 result 
combines real achievement with even greater promise.”</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">After merging with Topaz Energy &amp; Marine and having acquired BUE Marine, there 
has been more visibility in the earnings of Renaissance Services. This, coupled 
with an improved business risk profile, is expected to have a positive impact on 
the stock in the medium term. Additional stability and sustainability provided 
by new businesses (about 90 per cent sustainable revenues) should result in 
better visibility for the company’s income stream. We expect RNS to post an EPS 
of RO0.075 for FY07. Given the potential for further growth and strong liquidity 
position, we expect the company to be valued at higher multiples from its 
current levels. – <b>Vision<br>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">The company is experiencing its transition from a conglomerated structure to a 
business model aligned to oil &amp; gas sector. Key focus area for the company is 
oil &amp; gas fabrication, ship repair and offshore support vessel fleet. Apart from 
this, the company has presence in technology, media and education sector, which 
is aimed to be hived off during the year. We are positive on the company’s 
investment strategy to focus on increasing the size and reducing the age profile 
of offshore support vessel fleet. Also, the company plans to develop additional 
capacity in oil &amp; gas fabrication and ship repair businesses. The three-year 
capex programme of RO195 million will contribute to significant earnings growth 
in the long term, while for the medium term the company is to benefit from high 
demand scenario prevailing in oil and gas servicing sector. As the 
sustainability of the earning is visible, the stock demands better earning 
multiple than what prevails now. On the expected FY 2007 earnings, the stock is 
discounted at 8.6X at CMP of RO0.610. – <b>GIS</b></font></li>

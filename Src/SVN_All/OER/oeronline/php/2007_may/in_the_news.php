<b>Oman Mobile recently launched Corporate Private Network for its NAMA post-paid 
connection with loads of benefits for customers at down-to-earth prices<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="news1.jpg" width="198" height="220" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Business communication in Oman is on the cusp of a big change, thanks to the 
launch of the state-of-the-art network infrastructure based on a mobile virtual 
private network (MVPN) – the first of its kind in the Middle East. Christened 
the corporate private network (CPN), this cost-effective business communication 
service has been introduced by Oman Mobile, the leading provider of mobile 
telecommunication services in Oman. <br>
<br>
Says Mostafa Ahmed Kombor, Sales Manager, Oman Mobile, “through CPN, employees 
of a company can be connected to a single network with short codes or 
abbreviated numbers. Here, instead of dialling a colleague’s long public number, 
each member is assigned a four-digit number to make communication easier. 
Through these short codes, they can call each other and access voice, data and 
other value added services. Moreover, members can make unlimited number of free 
calls to other group members by paying only RO2.990 per member – a major 
cost-saver.”<br>
<br>
<b>Windfall for customers</b><br>
CPN is a specialised service available for NAMA post-paid corporate subscribers, 
who currently enjoy tremendous discounts on their corporate subscriptions along 
with a customised pricing plan that meets individual communication needs and 
usage patterns, discounts on call rates and increased talk time. CPN’s advantage 
is enabling easier and cost-effective access by the workforce of a company to a 
full-fledged mobile telephony service. Basically it is a private number plan, 
with short codes that link a minimum of 10 or more people. This single link or 
workgroup has access to scores of services which Oman Mobile offers to its 
customers, such as international roaming with 313 operators in over 135 
countries, web-enabled services, accessibility control by barring international 
and national calls, username and password protection, screening, managing users’ 
profile by removing or adding a number, grouping, attendance service, call 
waiting, credit ceiling, conferencing, among others. <br>
<br>
While Oman Mobile has been offering a similar service – ‘Friends and Family’ – 
to individual customers for a long time, CPN is the larger version of such 
service that is available only to corporate customers with additional features. 
“Thus, the new CPN service extends to corporate houses the benefits that earlier 
accrued to individual customers only,” adds Mostafa.<br>
<br>
<b>First in the Middle East <br>
</b>In order to provide infrastructural support for CPN, Oman Mobile has tied up 
with the US-based company, ITS, that has a pan-Middle East presence. Many of the 
Middle East countries such as Qatar, Bahrain, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc., 
have similar service based on the closed user group (CUG) model that is only a 
part of MVPN solution. CPN, against this, is a full-fledged MVPN that offers 
more than a simple CUG.<br>
<br>
“There’s a big need for CPN in this market,” says Mostafa, adding, “this has 
been proved by the initial response we have got after the launch of this 
service. After only two weeks of its launch, over 200 companies have shown keen 
interest to subscribe to this service.”<br>
<br>
The bottomline is that competition has proved to be a boon for the telecom 
sector in Oman with the onset of new products and value added services. And the 
introduction of CPN is the latest one on the block. In the days to come, Oman’s 
telecom market will witness more novel products and services, taking the sector 
to newer heights. </font>

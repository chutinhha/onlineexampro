<b>National Bank of Oman capitalises on business efficiency and emphasis on 
customers satisfaction<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover_9b.jpg" width="175" height="217" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">National Bank of Oman has continued its impressive performance for the second 
year in a row to retain its position in the Top 10. With BankMuscat doing well 
at the top and OIB improving its performance remarkably, NBO still has to do 
some more work. However, it is worth noting that the bank’s chief executive, 
Andrew Duff, has successfully put the bank in the high growth lane in 2006. 
Capitalising on its strategic partnership with the Commercial Bank of Qatar, the 
bank’s net worth increased to RO185 million during the year based on the profit 
recorded for the year.<br>
<br>
NBO also achieved a record in terms of net profit and strong growth in its 
business and services. The net profit for 2006 at RO30.4 million was 50 per cent 
higher than RO20.3 million profit it reported in 2005.<br>
<br>
Growth in total assets during the year saw these cross the RO1 billion mark for 
the first time in its 32-year history. This growth was linked to the growth in 
deposits by RO200 million (32 per cent) and growth in net advances by RO162 
million (30 per cent). These reflect a good trend and are consistent with the 
bank’s strategy to grow quality loans and deposits.<br>
<br>
More importantly, the bank’s profit from core operations increased by 40 per 
cent (from RO20 million to RO29 million) as compared to the 17 per cent growth 
this segment recorded in 2005. Clearly, this demonstrates the changing emphasis 
from preservation to growth within the bank, with the ultimate aim being 
ensuring sustainable returns to the shareholders.<br>
<br>
Other growth and business efficiency ratios also showed all-round improvement, 
with the cost to income ratio declining from 49.5 per cent to 44.6 per cent. The 
ration of other operating income in total income increased from 26 per cent to 
33 per cent, reducing the reliance on net interest income, while the return on 
average equity increased from 15 per cent to 19 per cent in 2006.<br>
<br>
The record net profit, overall growth and business efficiency combined with the 
emphasis on customer satisfaction saw the NBO being awarded The Banker’s 
Magazine award for the Best Bank in Oman for 2006. Also, the bank’s ratings were 
upgraded by Moody’s and Capital Intelligence.<br>
<br>
The year 2006 saw consumer banking operations post robust growth, with operating 
profit increasing by over 33 per cent over the previous year. This was supported 
by a 13 per cent growth in advances and 15 per cent growth in deposits. The 
positive performance of the market had its effect on the performance of the 
bank’s investment banking division. Thus, brokerage turnover grew by 75 per cent 
in 2006, with assets under management showing healthy growth and client 
portfolios as well as the bank’s proprietary portfolio performing well.<br>
<br>
The depth of existing relationships continued to expand and new relationships 
were entered into with a number of domestic and multinational business houses 
and government companies. The bank was also involved in prime infrastructure and 
project financing through both bilateral deals and syndications. Synergies in 
joint arrangement and co-financing with strategic partner, Commercial Bank of 
Qatar, proved fruitful in sharing of risk, structuring expertise, distribution 
and being able to originate larger more complex transactions. Operating profit 
during the year was up by 55 per cent, advances by 49 per cent and deposits by 
46 per cent over the year ago levels.<br>
<br>
As the bank entered the growth phase in 2006, it ensured that the risk 
management processes and systems were sufficiently robust to take care of future 
requirements.<br>
<br>
During the year the major initiatives undertaken included Third party account 
transfer facility was added through Internet banking and improvements were made 
in introducing new alerts to customers on specific events. A browser-based user 
friendly system was implemented for processing bulk salaries and this 
browser-based platform will serve as the base for introducing further browser 
based applications. <br>
<br>
Some of the major process improvement initiatives included the successful 
implementation of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system which has 
significantly reduced turn around time, input errors and improve efficiency in 
clearing. Also the new SMS system rollout in DBS &amp; branches has improved 
efficiency and processing time reduced.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Outlook<br>
</b>For 2007, the bank is focusing is on big-ticket deals, project financing and 
fee-based income by expanding the client base and increasing the share of 
business from existing clients. Specifically, the initiatives underway include 
setting up of the Sohar Strategic Business unit, consisting of a dedicated team 
of relationship managers, establishing a transaction banking team to focus on 
transaction banking, a dedicated unit to cater to the business needs of small 
and medium enterprises, and continued leveraging of the relationship with 
Commercial Bank of Qatar.<br>
<br>
“The operations for 2006 have been significant as we have built a platform for 
sustainable growth in business and profits. Earlier, the focus was on resolving 
the problem of non-performing assets and preserving capital. This has changed 
with the focus on growth being successfully re-ignited during the year with the 
support of Commercial Bank of Qatar,” NBO Deputy Chairperson Rawan Ahmed Al Said 
said in the firm’s annual report.<br>
<br>
The change is reflected with the bank’s profits from operations growing by 40 
per cent. There is clear expectation of continued economic growth in both Oman 
and the UAE during 2007, sustained by a high energy prices. The recently 
announced Oman budget for 2007 has considerably increased spending in all areas, 
including education, health and infrastructure, while continuing to be fiscally 
prudent. This will ensure that opportunities continue to be available to banks.<br>
<br>
NBO has established a clear strategy for growth in 2007 and beyond based on a 
balanced scorecard approach, where it has a clearly defined strategy with 
respect to financial performance, customers and products, process and service 
improvement and development of its employees.</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">The bank has clearly moved beyond its consolidation phase and entered the growth 
phase. For the year 2006, the bank’s loan book grew by 30 per cent to RO704 
million, with an addition of about RO163 million from December 2005 levels. 
Deposits grew even faster at 32.5 per cent to RO817m, though at a marginally 
higher cost. On our assumptions of a 30 per cent growth in loan book in 2007, we 
expect the NBO to generate an EPS of RO0.390 and Book Value Per Share of 
RO2.734. Current valuations discount the EPS estimate by 13.5 times and BVPS 
estimate by 1.9 times. Even in 2007, the potential of an earnings upside from 
provision write back remains strong. – <b>Vision</b><br>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">The National Bank of Oman (NBO), the second largest in terms of loan books in 
the country, has seen cleansing of its books through restructuring and strategic 
initiatives. While 2006 has seen restructuring phase contributing to earnings 
growth, in 2007 the Bank is well placed to reap the benefit and enter the growth 
phase. With an efficient top management in place and aggressive strategy, the 
Bank is on a definite growth path. We believe NBO is well placed in the sector, 
with focus to improve its profitability and shareholder value. We are strongly 
positive on the Bank for next couple of years, during which we expect the RoE 
(FY06 –16.5 per cent) to improve to regional industry standards. For FY07, the 
Bank is expected to register an EPS of 435 baiza, which is 12.4X on the current 
		market price of RO5.400. – <b>GIS</b></font></li>

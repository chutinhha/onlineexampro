Ringing in the glory<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The No. 1 company of 2005, Omantel continues its good show in 2006 on the back 
of a monopoly in certain verticals of the telecom sector</b><br>
<br>
After making a grand debut last year, this majority government-owned company 
continued its commendable performance in 2006 to retain its numero uno status. 
The company, which was established in 1980 pursuant to Law No. 43 of 1980 as the 
General Telecommunications Organisation (GTO), has been a monopoly provider of 
telecommunications services since then. In view of emerging competition in the 
mobile market, Omantel Group established Oman Mobile in 2004, as a subsidiary 
company. Omantel became a public listed company in 2005. Omantel is currently 
owned 70 per cent by the government and 30 per cent by private investors 
(including pension fund). The sector competition began in March 2005 and the 
mobile segment was the first one to open up for competition.<br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="cover_1a.jpg" width="175" height="219" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Industry overview</b><br>
The government has started implementing the telecom sector liberalisation in 
line with World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement. Beginning March 2005, the 
industry witnessed competition in the mobile sector through the licensing of a 
second mobile operator. The recent signing of the free trade agreement between 
Oman and the USA is expected to accelerate the sector liberalisation process. 
The indications are that the Internet and value-added services will be 
liberalised soon, followed by fixed telephony services. Omantel has already 
initiated steps to prepare for this evolving competitive scenario and has 
appointed a renowned international consultant to assist the management in this 
process.<br>
<br>
“With fixed business services set to open up for competition in 2007, the 
telecom market in Oman would undergo further dynamic changes in telecom service 
offerings. New Internet and other value-added service providers are expected to 
enter the market soon. This would provide the market with numerous service 
offerings that are not available at present. We realise that there are still 
opportunities to increase customer base and penetration levels in Oman,” said Dr 
Mohammed Ali Al-Wohaibi, CEO, Omantel.<br>
<br>
As the leading telecommunication service provider in Oman, Omantel Group is 
strongly placed not only to compete with newcomers in the fixed line business 
segment, but also to benefit from the same through providing wholesale services 
to new telecom operators. This is due to strong national brands, fully built-out 
and up-to-date network, and capable workforce in development, national 
distribution as well as systems and processes efforts to provide and deliver 
services and support customers.<br>
<br>
However, liberalisation would further stimulate the telecom market, and as 
witnessed in other such markets, the likely price dilution would significantly 
impact the sector’s profitability. <br>
<br>
<b>Financial performance</b><br>
The total group revenue at the end of December 2006 rose by 20 per cent to 
RO323.6 million, compared to the corresponding period the previous year. Net 
profit is RO81.1 million, an increase of 19 per cent compared to the previous 
year’s period. Earning per share for the year is RO0.108. Total operating 
expenses of the Omantel Group amounted to RO230 million in 2006, an increase of 
19 per cent compared to last year. As a percentage of total service revenue, 
Opex was 71.1 per cent in 2006, while the ratio in 2005 was 71.6 per cent. The 
total assets of the Omantel Group have, over the past three years, increased, 
reflecting the capital investments that the Omantel Group has incurred to 
upgrade and expand its network especially in the mobile and fixed line services. 
The fixed assets, principally telecom equipment and facilities, now account for 
68 per cent of the total assets. Total subscriber base (all services) has 
recorded a growth of 12 per cent. Total number of subscribers has increased to 
1,629,000 as on December 2006 compared to 1,453,000 in the corresponding period 
previous year.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Major achievements</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> <br>
Some of the major achievements of 2006 were:<br>
<br>
<b>Investment in telecom infrastructure</b>: During 2006, the company signed over RO32 
million worth of contracts, mostly infrastructure-based covering both Omantel 
and Oman Mobile.<br>
<br>
<b>National E-Government and BankNet project</b>: These projects are next generation 
network services based on the latest Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) 
technology. This innovative network service will have the capability of 
supporting data, voice and video over the same infrastructure and will ensure 
service delivery according to defined and guaranteed Service Level Agreements 
(SLA). Omantel signed an agreement with Information Technology Authority (ITA) 
for the establishment of e-government network and with Central Bank of Oman (CBO) 
for the establishment of BankNet network. While, these agreements would provide 
integrated telecommunication solutions, they would also support diverse needs of 
telecommunication requirements of each of these entities.<br>
<br>
<b>Wireless fixed phone lines service (WLL)</b>: First phase of the service was 
launched on March 25, 2006, covering 25 rural villages in the Government of Dhofar. The project is expected to cover 200 rural villages over two phases, 
providing telecommunication facilities to remote population.<br>
<br>
<b>WiFi (Hotspot) Service</b>: The service was launched on March 27, 2006, under the 
brand name ‘Ibhar.’ The service is available in over 12 locations comprising 
major shopping malls, coffee shops and hotels.<br>
<br>
MoU with Flag Telecom Company: Omantel signed a memorandum of understanding on 
June 25, 2006, with Flag Telecommunications Company. This will make the 
Sultanate an Internet transit point between the Middle East and Africa.<br>
<br>
<b>Pakistani Trans World Associates (TWA)</b>: Omantel and the leading Pakistani Trans 
World Associates (TWA) Telecommunications Company launched submarine fibre 
optics cable project on July 28, 2006, which will provide a telecommunication 
link between Oman and Pakistan. The TWA project is one of the successes of the 
Falcon project, as it will enable Omantel to sell some of its vast cable 
capacities.<br>
<br>
<b>Omania E-Commerce Company (Tejari Oman)</b>: Omantel announced the signing of an 
agreement with Omania E commerce company (Tejari Oman) to provide electronic 
purchase solutions known as ‘Tejari Transact.’ This is a set of commercial 
solutions over the Internet, which guarantees flexibility and transparency as 
well as reduces purchasing costs.<br>
<br>
<b>Belgacom International Carrier Services</b>: Omantel signed a MOU on November 22, 
2006, with Belgacom International Carrier Services, to establish the framework 
for a partnership that will further develop respective international carrier 
services. The MOU will form the basis of a cooperation deriving mutual benefit 
for both operators, with the aim to be amongst the top providers of 
international wholesale services within the Middle East.<br>
<br>
<b>Telecommunication backbone service to PDO</b>: Omantel signed a long-term contract 
for the provision of Telecommunication Backbone service to PDO for the total 
amount of RO12 million, covering a period of over 11 years.<br>
<br>
<b>Telecommunication backbone service to Ministry of Information (MoI)</b>: The Tender 
Board has awarded a contract to Omantel to provide terrestrial links for TV 
transmission for the MoI at a total amount of RO1.4 million per annum.<br>
<br>
<b>Mobile Number Portability (MNP)</b>: Mobile Number Portability (MNP) was introduced 
on August 26, 2006, by both mobile operators (Oman Mobile and Nawras). This was 
implemented as part of the directive from the Telecommunication Regulatory 
Authority, which would allow customers to switch to other mobile operators 
without changing their numbers.<br>
<br>
<b>Gulf Economic Award</b>: Omantel won the 2006 Gulf Economic Award organised by 
Dubai-based Datamax Company. The award is granted annually to the best 
organisation and institutions which play a positive role in supporting the Gulf 
economy, attracting foreign investment and realising good practical results 
through sound management and leadership.<br>
<br>
<b>Deals of the Year Award</b>: Omantel won the ‘Deals of the Year’ award from the 
British magazine (The Banker). Omantel was selected amongst other Omani 
companies on the basis of the largest IPO in Oman, in addition to the company’s 
strong appeal amongst smaller investors. <br>
<br>
<b>5th Gulf Excellence Award</b>: Omantel was presented with the ‘GulfExcellence Award’ 
for their outstanding accomplishments for playing active role in the economic 
diversification drive.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Fixed Business</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Special consumer promotions with attractive offers for fixed line services, 
Internet with PC bundle offers, Broadband (ADSL) service, free surfing hours, 
etc., were offered during Muscat/Khareef Festival, Comex’06 and Ramadhan. 
Special Fixed Line additional services were offered to subscribers free of costs 
like caller ID, call waiting, follow me, three party conversation, and Omantel 
automatic call transfer (Self Hunting). With this service one can transfer calls 
to a vacant number from a specific group of numbers when the subscriber’s phone 
is busy. Also, there were FIFA World Cup offers where 12 winners were given 
fully paid tickets to the World Cup.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Outlook</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
The company is readying itself to face stiff competition as the government is in 
the process of issuing license to a second fixed-line operator. “We always 
welcome healthy competition and we are gearing up to face the expected 
competition in the fixed-line segment. We have implemented projects involving 
more than RO100 million between 2005 and 2006 to enhance our fixed network 
infrastructure. The thrust is always on building a robust and resilient 
fixed-line network, which will position Omantel as ‘carrier of carriers’ in a 
developing competitive scenario,” Al-Wohaibi said. Capital projects, involving 
RO250 million (including RO100 million for fixed network expansion and RO130 
million for mobile network expansion) were implemented between 2004 and 2006.<br>
<br>
New initiatives adopted by the company to equip itself to face stiff competition 
ahead included appointment of an international consultant to advise the company 
on scientific development strategies, especially to face competition in 
fixed-line segment. An international consultant will also advise the company on 
how the free-trade agreement between Oman and US will affect Omantel.<br>
<br>
Also, Oman is witnessing a major information, communication and technology 
sector liberalisation. Economic liberalisation provides enormous opportunities 
for international and regional telecom companies to do business in Oman. The 
fixed-line base of Omantel, as on December 31, 2006, stood at over 271,000 as 
against 258,000 at the end of December 2005.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Oman Mobile no longer enjoys monopoly as a second public 
mobile licence was awarded to Nawras in 2005. Oman Mobile enjoys a market share 
of 72 per cent (1.246 million subscribers). Total mobile phone subscribers in 
Oman stand at over 1.7 million. The company is also getting ready for 
competition in the Internet service sector.<br>
<br>
Apart from gearing itself up for the domestic competition, the company is 
looking beyond Oman. “We are keeping an eye on all markets in the region for 
expansion – not only in the Arab region but also in North African and South 
Asian countries,” Al-Wohaibi said. He said the Omani company was interested in 
bidding for a mobile service provider’s licence in Qatar. But the company will 
have to wait for the new network to get ready. In all, the next 2-3 years could 
turn critical for the company as the sector opens up further, and the pressure 
of shareholders too mounts with regard to the company’s performance on the 
bourses.</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman’s integrated telecom service provider has seen earnings growth of 19.6 per 
cent during 2006. The mobile segment remains the key growth driver for the 
future, which currently contributes 61 per cent of the topline. However this 
segment has seen competition from the entry of second service provider, Nawras. 
The ARPU for the segment has fallen to RO14 and may be under pressure in the 
near future before saturating. Issue of new licenses will bring in new entrants 
in fixed line and internet space, further impacting the other lines of business. 
On the flip side, the company will benefit from expected cut in regulatory 
charges like royalty, which would augment earnings growth. The company has to 
grow inorganically, for which we believe the preparations are already under way. 
On the FY 2006 earnings of 108 baizas, the stock is trading at a multiple of 
10.4X. It is discounted at 9.9X of FY 2007 earning. For the moment we have a 
neutral outlook on the company. – <b>GIS<br>

        <li>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: -20px">
        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Omantel could be viewed currently as a defensive stock with an above-average 
dividend yield of about 6 per cent. The increase in economic activity is surely 
a boon to this utility player, and the call volumes are expected to grow well. 
However, the business model of the company faces threats in the short term in 
the form of new telecom licenses being issued for Fixed Line/Internet. Despite 
the ‘incumbent’ disadvantages, the company is putting up a brave fight with 
competition in the home turf, while still coping with rising staff costs and 
marketing expenses. We expect an earnings growth between 7-10 per cent for 2007, 
on the basis of which current valuations appear to be ‘all priced-in.’ – <b>Vision</b></font></li>

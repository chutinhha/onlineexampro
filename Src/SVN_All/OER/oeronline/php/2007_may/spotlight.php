<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The AC and refrigerating unit market is soaring regionally as well as globally, 
with changing customers’ profile and cutting-edge technologies adding value to 
the products</b></font><br><br><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<img border="0" src="spot.jpg" width="349" height="240" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">In the recent past, an apparent boost is seen in the global market in the 
retailing of air-conditioning and refrigeration products. The phenomenon of 
global warming plays a decisive role in the reformation of these products into a 
necessity good, more than a luxury one. Also the extraordinary increase in the 
consumption of these products in developing economies intensifies the rate of 
growth to a large extent. As the markets in developed economies are saturated, 
major brands are focusing on canalizing their efforts on the escalating markets 
in these developing economies.<br>
<br>Worldwide the market is shifting from unitary to split ACs and energy efficient 
VRV systems. In 2006 alone, an approximate of 65 million units was established 
as the total world consumption of air conditioners. China and the US topped the 
list with more than 20 million and 17.7 million consumers respectively, followed 
closely by Japan at eight million. Together China, US and Japan make up 3/4 of 
the world market. Last year, exports of ACs from China to the world market stood 
at 25 million units. In other words, China has become the world’s AC supply 
centre and top four manufacturers being Gree, Midea, Chigo and Haier.<br>
<br>During the same period, Middle East single-handedly consumed an approximate of 3 
million units. The Middle East market has been a major market for air 
conditioning products for a very long time, predominantly due to the climatic 
conditions. The other reasons for these overwhelming figures could vary from 
improving lifestyle quotient to the materialisation of malls and hypermarkets, 
which would oblige for commercial air conditioning requirements.<br>
<br>As regards refrigerators, they are a fundamental part of any household. In fact 
it is seen that in the last few years, refrigerators have now repositioned to 
the living room from the kitchen, substantiating its necessity even in a 
business environment. The growth is more rapid in developing countries, 
especially in China with its vast population and its rising consumption of 
frozen food. The level of urbanisation is the major basis on which the demand 
for commercial refrigeration equipment has increased. This is particularly true 
in developing countries where the urban population has higher income levels than 
those in rural areas. In the ranking of purchase requirements of consumer 
durable products refrigerators figure in the top three in any given market. This 
applies even in Middle East and in Oman.<br>
<br><b>AC market in Oman</b><br>Air-conditioners and refrigerators have been at the front-end within the white 
goods distribution business in Oman. Both these products account for as much as 
65 to 70 per cent of the total business in the entire white goods category and 
villas and multi-storey buildings contribute to 70 per cent of the market. Oman 
has been a market for traditional window ACs. However, for the last couple of 
years there has been a paradigm shift to split and ducted split air-conditioners 
in line with the global trend. The reason attributed to this is mainly the price 
erosion of split air-conditioners. It is also observed that the air-conditioner, 
which was traditionally used to be viewed as a seasonal product, has 
increasingly been showing decent numbers in off-season as well. This is mainly 
due to the various ongoing projects in the country fuelling the sales of 
air-conditioners. As P.V. Rao, senior deputy GM, Genetco says, “The 
air-conditioning and refrigeration market in Oman is soaring because of the 
economic boom the Sultanate is going through. The construction and industrial 
boom in Oman have driven the demand of ACs to a much higher level.”<br>
<br>Further, the local consumers are now fastidious about their preference with 
parameters ranging from styling, storage space, size and similar other such 
specifications. The leading brands now concentrate on technological innovations 
in this field, introducing the microprocessor-based controls to reduce energy 
use and also implementing the use of insulating materials along with distinctive 
features like plasma filters and deodorisers. The market within this product has 
become so definite, that it is seen that families own more than one 
refrigeration system within the household, owing to preference of small-sized 
refrigerators.<br>
<br>In 2006, as many as 150,000 units were sold in the Sultanate which itself speaks 
about the volume of the business air-conditioner and refrigerator contributes. 
As Gautam Shanbhag, Divisional Manager – Air-conditioning, OTE group, the sole 
distributor of LG says, “Air-conditioning market in Oman shows a positive 
outlook of growth riding on a buoyant economy.” Although the domestic market is 
dominated by Japanese and Korean brands, Saudi-based firms are also trying to 
make their presence felt in Oman. While American and European origin dominates 
on chillers, Chinese manufacturers have entered the market and have a share of 
more than 30,000 split units at lower prices. Varghese Samuel, Deputy GM, Muscat 
Electronics, explains, “In Oman the expected market size in the current year is 
150,000 units of which 100,000 will be split units and remaining unitary 
products like window and package units.”<br>
<br>In recent years the demand of different air-conditioning solutions has increased 
manifold in Oman. As Rajendra Nadkarni, Divisional Manager, Project &amp; 
Engineering Division, Omasco says, “Manufacturers have introduced a large range 
of air conditioning products to suit the demands that includes windows, splits, 
cassettes, ducted spilt, package and chillers for various residential and 
commercial applications.” Companies such as Toshiba, LG, Daikin, Sanyo, Samsung, 
General, Sharp, Chigo and Panasonic have introduced fresh and new variety in 
their current production.<br>
<br><b>Changing consumer preferences</b><br>An air-conditioner is no more just for cooling. With the lifestyle, one’s 
mindset also changes. Consumers are well informed and up-to-date with the type 
and kind of products available in the market. They only decide on a product 
after an extensive market research and if the product ensures all his/her 
aspects of requirements. Consumers have become more health conscious and demands 
for products that match to their level of need. Now days Air-conditioner is 
required to control the purity of the air also in addition to cooling &amp; humidity 
control. The latest technology includes special filters, which are anti virus 
and anti bacteria facilities. Customers are now considering the brand value, 
aesthetics and value added features that the products offer, and not just the 
functionality. Due to this, manufacturers are given the prospect of beating the 
competition by differentiating their product and offering a USP to the market. 
However it is seen that the market keeps growing and the differentiation becomes 
confined and the products tend to get commoditised. Ajay Ganti, GM, SARCO says, 
“Today air-conditioners are increasingly being viewed as a machine that has more 
hygiene value. People are picking up air-conditioners that remove bacteria and 
foul smell from the room apart from cooling it.”<br>
<br>As seen, there is a distinct shift in consumer preferences over the last few 
years. People are switching over from windows to split air conditioners as they 
have started realising the advantages of such units. On the one hand, the 
difference in prices between these two types is increasingly narrowing down, 
while on the other, split ACs consume less power, lower noise levels, and ease 
of maintenance and better aesthetics than window ACs. As Rajendra Nadkarni says, 
“In Oman quality, reliability and after-sales services are the major factors 
prompting purchase of air-conditioners. The customer’s profile too has changed. 
Today in an era of information flood, most of the Omanis have access to 
information and are much more aware of the needs and are able to choose and 
pick. They know that the available product is no more only for cooling but also 
has value addition in terms of health.” Varghese Samuel adds, “In Oman, the 
customers in the interior region look at the price, while in the capital area of 
Muscat the customers prefer ducted type of ACs.”<br>
<br>Although villas and flat owners who buy air-conditioners for their own use 
prefer split ACs, those who rent out their apartments still go for window units. 
The new dwelling units that are coming up in Oman mostly favour the split ACs 
over the conventional window ones.<br>
<br><b>Eco friendly technology</b><br>Manufacturers are attempting to modify the traditional technologies to have a 
less impact on the deteriorating environment. They are now investing millions of 
dollars to upgrade an extensive range of novel refrigeration concepts to that 
effect. The prospect of using substitute refrigerants like carbon dioxide that 
do not destroy the ozone layer or trigger global warming, are now being 
accomplished. Ozone damaging R 22 is likely to be banned shortly by all 
countries as done by US, Europe and Japan.<br>
<br>Though this refrigerant was preferred during the early 20th century, man-made 
chemicals later deposed it. Due to the technical enhancements, which comprises 
of manufacture of extremely thin aluminium tubing called ‘micro channels’; 
carbon dioxide can now resurface as the refrigerant of preference. Conventional 
refrigerants, called as hydro fluorocarbons, produce more global warming than 
the same quantity of carbon dioxide as a global warming gas. The minute amounts 
of carbon dioxide that would be emitted from air conditioners would be 
inconsequential, contrary to the large quantities produced from burning fossil 
fuels for energy and transportation.<br>
<br>Carbon dioxide is encouraged for systems that must be small and lightweight, 
such as portable air conditioners. High operating pressure required for carbon 
dioxide systems, enable the refrigerant to flow through small-diameter tubing 
are the different factors that enable engineers to fabricate more compact air 
conditioners.<br>

        UAE leads the Arab World</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
        Oman ranked second best among ‘middle stage of development’ countries<br>
        <br>
        </b>The UAE is the most competitive economy in the Arab world among the 
        countries in the most advanced stage of development, according to The 
        Arab World Competitiveness Report 2007 of the World Economic Forum. The 
        UAE is followed by Qatar and Kuwait. Among countries at the second stage 
        of development, Tunisia and Oman are the best performing Arab economies 
        while Egypt is the regional best performer in the third group of 
        countries.<br>
        <br>
        This year’s report covered 13 Arab economies – Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, 
        Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia 
        and the UAE. Libya, Oman and Syria were assessed for the first time. The 
        report ranked the countries in three groups according to the stage of 
        development to enable benchmarking against peers in other parts of the 
        world.</font></p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="gcc1.jpg" width="500" height="442"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Accordingly, the UAE, the best performing Arab country, has been ranked 
        the 29th among the 40 most advanced economies. Sound economic management 
        has contributed to stabilising the macroeconomic environment and 
        strengthening public institutions. Areas of concern include educational 
        attainment, in particular at the primary and secondary levels, said the 
        report, adding that these need to be tackled on a priority basis, as the 
        lack of an educated workforce could put current diversification efforts 
        at risk. The report calls for increasing efforts to promote innovation 
        and tertiary education, and steps to combat red tape that constrains 
        competition for goods and services.<br>
        <br>
        According to the report, Oman is the second best ranked Arab country in 
        the group of countries at the middle stage of development, coming in at 
        8th rank in the group of 40 peer countries. The country’s solid outcomes 
        on macroeconomic indicators, its well-developed institutions and high 
        level of efficiency of labour markets contributed to this result, said 
        the report. However, the country’s competitive position can be improved 
        upon by increasing the level of education and upgrading technological 
        capability to embrace innovation.<br>
        <br>
        The rankings are drawn from a combination of publicly available data and 
        the results of the Executive Opinion Survey, a comprehensive annual 
        survey conducted by the World Economic Forum, together with its network 
        of partner institutes (leading research institutes and business 
        organisations) in the countries covered by the report. Over 11,000 
        business leaders were polled in a record 128 economies worldwide. The 
        survey questionnaire was designed to capture a broad range of factors 
        affecting an economy’s business climate that are critical determinants 
        of sustained growth. The Forum annually delivers a comprehensive 
        overview of the main strengths and weaknesses in a large number of 
        countries, making it possible to identify key areas for policy 
        formulation and reform.<br>
        <br>
        The Arab World Competitiveness Report series serves as a platform for 
        public-private dialogue on issues related to competitiveness. These 
        high-level discussions use the findings of this report as a basis for 
        competitiveness benchmarking and for advancing policy discussions.<br>
        <br>
        Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic 
        Forum, said: “Although the region’s economies are currently very dynamic 
        and offer tremendous business opportunities, there is no doubt that 
        improvements to national competitiveness and closer integration with the 
        global economy and within the region are necessary if this growth 
        momentum is to be sustained.”<br>
        <br>
        Stressing the importance of education reforms, Sherif El Diwany, 
        Director, Middle East , World Economic Forum, said: “Entrepreneurship, 
        an element that is often cited as the key to unlocking the potential of 
        the Arab economies, can only take root in societies where freedom of 
        thought, enthusiasm for inquiry and critical thinking are popular 
        values.”</font></p>

        Tahlia Street in downtown Riyadh, marking the first stage of its ‘Smart 
        City’ programme.<br>
        <br>
        The new wireless street is part of Riyadh City’s ‘Smart City’ programme, 
        which has already brought wireless internet to the city’s main coffee 
        shops and hotels. The wireless system begins working when someone turns 
        on a computer and connecting is free of charge. A Wi-Fi enabled laptop 
        or other wireless device automatically picks up the signal sent from 
        WiMAX hubs along the street and gains access to the system when the user 
        agrees to the terms of one of the web sites.<br>
        <br>
        Said Mohammed Saqer, Chief Executive Officer, ITC, “It is now possible 
        for anyone with an Intel Centrino notebook or other wireless enabled 
        device to seamlessly connect to the internet from anywhere on Tahlia 
        Street between Olaya Street and Dhabab Street.”<br>
        <br>
        “This installation of free wireless on Tahlia Street is a good example 
        of how a public-private partnership should work,” said Ferhad Patel, 
        General Manager, Intel Corporation, Saudi Arabia.<br>
        <br>
        The service, sponsored by Intel Corporation, the Communications and 
        Information Technology Commission (CITC) and the Riyadh Development 
        Authority, seeks to revitalise communities through the WiMAX technology.<br>
        <br>
        “With a longer range than the popular Wi-Fi wireless standard, WiMAX-enabled 
        laptops and portable devices will give mobile workers even more freedom 
        to get a fast and affordable internet connection wherever they are,” 
        added Patel.<br>
        <br>
        The service can also benefit local businesses that already exist on the 
        Tahlia Street WiMax strip. By investing in wireless technology, offices 
        within the zone will be able to make full use of the WiMax signal to 
        connect to the internet and download data.</font></p>

        <b>Phase I of ‘The Avenues’ launched</b><br>
        The first phase of Kuwait’s largest commercial development ‘The Avenues’ 
        was officially launched by the Amir of Kuwait, His Highness Sheikh Sabah 
        Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah. With an overall investment of US$1 billion 
        for the four phases which will be opened in stages, ‘The Avenues’ is set 
        to become Kuwait’s premier shopping, leisure and business destination 
        when completed in 2010.<br>
        <br>
        The first major project conceived and developed by Mabanee, Kuwait’s 
        premier real estate developer, it will host the widest selection of 
        international brands in the region spread over 216 stores, including 
        Kuwait’s first Carrefour hypermarket, the region’s largest IKEA store, 
        Cinescape, (a 10-screen Cinema complex), 39 restaurants and cafes within 
        a lively ‘Theatre of Food’. <br>
        <br>
        The mall has been designed by the world-renowned architects, Norr 
        Consultants International, a firm that has built some of the most 
        distinctive buildings in the Middle East, including the Emirates Towers 
        in Dubai. Norr was selected for the project following a rigorous 
        international design competition involving some of the world’s leading 
        architects. Al Ghanim International are the main contractors.<br>
        <br>
        Phase One comprises 170,000 sq. m of leasable area and parking for over 
        4,000 cars.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
        Phase Two, scheduled to open in early 2008, will add nearly 60,000 sq. m 
        of leisure and retail space and parking for over 2,000 cars. In its 
        third phase, set to open in late 2008, ‘The Avenues’ will add a boutique 
        mall, spa, theme restaurants, an entertainment complex, water features 
        and facilities that are new to Kuwait.After completion of the final 
        phase by 2010, the destination will feature a state-of-the-art business 
        centre, complete with four-star hotels, office space, a convention 
        centre and a theatre. The mall’s current 4,000 car parking spaces will 
        increase to 15,000. The project is being developed in a prime site 
        measuring 425,000 sq.m. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Finding private sector jobs </b> <br>
        Latest published figures point out to declining representation of 
        Bahraini nationals in jobs offered in the private sector. The issue is 
        critical partly due to absence of growth of job opportunities in the 
        public sector.<br>
        <br>
        According to General Organisation for Social Insurance (GOSI), locals 
        accounted for 21 per cent employment in private establishments in 2006, 
        thereby continuing a disturbing trend. Nationals represented 24 per cent 
        of private sector jobs in 2005 and 27 per cent in 2004. The issue is 
        vital in the light of greater involvement of private sector firms in the 
        economy, thanks to on-going reforms that call for limiting public sector 
        role. The reforms seek to bring about efficiency in the economy. It is 
        feared that the trend could deepen the job challenge for locals, as 
        private sector firms seek to generate maximum profit by operating at the 
        lowest possible cost. <br>
        <br>
        To be sure, the private sector succeeded in bringing about 14,000 new 
        jobs in 2006. The employment figures increased from 299,080 in 2005 to 
        313,039 in 2006. However, Bahrainis only accounted for 65,614 jobs in 
        2006, down from 71,900 in 2005. Thus, foreign nationals soaked up all 
        new job opportunities last year. <br>
        <br>
        Private sector firms prefer employing expatriates over locals for 
        numerous reasons, notably difference in pay. According to GOSI 
        statistics, the average salary in the private sector stood at BD210 
        (US$556) in 2006. However, the average monthly pay amounted to BD414 for 
        Bahraini nationals versus BD156 for foreign nationals. Hence, 
        expatriates received an average of 38 per cent of what locals earned.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is this difference in pay that accounts for private sector preference 
        for foreign employees. Still, employers consider other factors such as 
        productivity and customer service when evaluating employment decisions. 
        However, there are other issues, notably lack of laws that somehow 
        provide private firms the opportunity to exploit expatriates. It is 
        believed that some firms tend to delay payment of salaries when it comes 
        to foreign nationals. Still, others demand that expatriate work longer 
        than normal hours. Certainly, firms cannot apply such unacceptable 
        conditions on nationals.<br>
        <br>
        In short, employment statistics suggest that authorities must exert 
        greater efforts in order to convince private sector firms to provide job 
        opportunities to locals.</font></p><hr width="90%" size="1">

        <img border="0" src="gcc6.jpg" width="150" height="74" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Barwa Real Estate has announced a breakthrough solution to the housing 
        cost challenge facing Qatar’s resident workers. <br>
        <br>
        The Doha-based real estate giant unveiled plans to develop and release 
        over 2,000 modern housing units on low rentals to limited-income earners 
        in a move aimed at easing the housing shortage in the city. According to 
        Barwa executives, this is the beginning of a series of steps focussed on 
        combating the inflated real estate market. <br>
        <br>
        <b>
        <img border="0" src="gcc4.jpg" width="175" height="141" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>The rising housing cost in Doha has been a cause for concern for 
        residents and employers alike. Though Qatar’s Ministry of Economy and 
        Commerce imposed a 10 per cent limit on annual rent increases in 2006 in 
        an effort to curb the astronomical rise in rents, the move had little 
        effect. In fact, rentals appear likely to increase further in the 
        short-term before supply catches up with demand as more construction 
        projects take shape. The brisk pace of economic growth has exposed some 
        capacity constraints in the building industry, leading to higher housing 
        costs. This has in turn pushed consumer price inflation up to around 9 
        per cent. Inflation is expected to ease slightly to around 7.5 per cent 
        in 2007 as more housing comes on stream. <br>
        <br>
        Barwa will place its 2,000 units on the market for a monthly rent of 
        QR3,500. The project will be located in two central points in Qatar’s Al 
        Sayliah and Messameir areas and the company is looking to complete 
        construction by April 2008. <br>
        <br>
        Barwa is one of the regions largest publicly listed real estate 
        developers, reporting revenue of US$889 million in 2006. Barwa is also 
        among the regions top 20 developers with US$3.76 billion invested in 
        mega projects currently under development.</font></p>

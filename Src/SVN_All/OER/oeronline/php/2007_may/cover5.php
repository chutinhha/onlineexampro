<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Oman Cables Industry is the company to watch out for in the near 
to medium term – its 266 per cent net profit growth is phenomenal<br>
</b>
<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover_5a.jpg" width="175" height="219" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">In just two years, Oman Cables has moved up six positions from 14th in 2003 to 
eighth in 2006. This year, the company further improved its performance to 
occupy the fifth place. In the process, it has disturbed many an applecart. <br>
<br>
<b>The year that was<br>
</b>The company’s stupendous performance in 2006 has been, indeed, unique and it 
owes its success to the strong foundation laid by the founders, Mustafa Bin 
Mukhtar Ali Al Lawati, the Chairman and Hussain Bin Salman Al Lawati, 
Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, in 1984 backed by the management’s 
tenacious efforts, in the face of endless impediments along the way.<br>
<br>
The massive investments in capacity expansion initiated in early 2005 were 
successfully completed as originally planned and have resulted in high 
production, record market share and sales revenue in 2006. <br>
<br>
Total sales reached RO125.71 million, compared to RO60.58 million in 2005, a 
growth of 107 per cent. Net profit was up by 266 per cent to RO9.53 million from 
RO2.60 million in 2005. The return on the capital, as on December 31, 2006 
(prior to the increase of share capital), was 319 per cent. <br>
<br>
In the backdrop of achieving record sales of RO85.203 million in the first nine 
months of 2006, the Board of Directors recognised the need to reconsider and 
restructure the capital reflecting the revised increasing needs of OCI’s ongoing 
and growing operations. A resolution was passed at the Extra Ordinary General 
Meeting (EOGM) on December 2, 2006, to increase the paid-up capital by 
distributing the ploughed back profits in the company by offering two bonus 
shares of RO1 par value for every one ordinary equity share of RO1 – a mid-term 
dividend of 200 per cent. This was yet another unique initiative in the Omani 
capital market. <br>
<br>
On January 25, 2007, the Board of Directors again reviewed the cash dividend to 
be paid to its shareholders and the possibility to distribute further 10 per 
cent besides two bonus shares already paid as dividend, subject to the approval 
of AGM. The EOGM also approved of recasting shares from RO1 per share into 100 
Bz per share. The decision was taken keeping in view the increasing value of 
OCI’s shares at the Muscat Secur ities Market (MSM). This has helped in easy 
day-to-day mobility of shares at the MSM. The market value of OCI’s new 100-Bz 
equity shares was in the range of RO1 to RO1.090 during December 2006. During 
2006, OCI shares formed one of the important constituents of the MSM share 
index.<br>
<br>
During the year, OCI made a significant presence in the growing oil and gas 
segment. It also achieved significant share of utilities consumption of power 
cables in the GCC and European markets and has been able to establish credible 
interface with international EPC majors that are executing large infrastructure 
projects in GCC, North Africa and other international locations.<br>
<br>
Another milestone during the year was that OCI completed a expansion project, 
including backward integration for PVC compounding, OCI has already started 
implementing yet another substantial expansion project, including creation of 
infrastructure for future growth, by making an investment in excess of US$20 
million.

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The year ahead<br>
</b>Oman Cables chairman Mustafa Bin Muktar Bin Ali Al Lawati, while continuing to 
look for further growth in the coming years, had a word of caution for 
shareholders: The growth rate in revenue terms in the near future may be highly 
dependent on movement of highly unpredictable prices of metals – particularly 
copper – the main cost element in cable manufacturing. Apart from putting 
profits under pressure, it also stretches the working capital requirements to 
higher levels. <br>
<br>
OCI is primarily in to manufacturing low, medium and high voltage power cables 
and overhead line conductors. A significant portion of cables is used for power 
transmission and distribution in GCC, where the company sees immense 
opportunities. Rapid industrialisation at Sohar and heightened activity in 
tourism and real estate sectors in the Sultanate of Oman will continue to boost 
the demand for power cables. Same is the case in other GCC countries such as UAE 
and KSA that are investing multi-billion US dollars in developing the power and 
water infrastructure. OCI, with its own network offices in UAE, Qatar and 
Kuwait, is well placed to cash in on these opportunities. OCI has also 
selectively entered global markets in Europe, UK, North Africa and the Pacific 
Rim countries, aiming at increasing sales and long-term profitability. 
Notwithstanding the buoyant demand, the increased capacities both by existing 
manufacturers as well as by new players will continue to put pressure on market 
prices.<br>
<br>
The global power cable market would continue to grow, albeit at a lower rate in 
2007. Developing economies such as China and India would continue to register a 
stronger growth. OCI, with its footprint in India, will have its share in this 
growing market. GCC markets with their huge investments in infrastructure would 
continue to grow with resultant demand for power cables. However, increased 
supplies from regional and global cable manufacturers would continue to put 
pressure on realisations. OCI’s recent investments in state-of-the-art 
technologies as well as backward integration would provide it with the 
competitive edge in serving global markets. OCI had a historic year in 2006 with 
a 107 per cent growth in sales turnover and a 266 per cent increase in net 
profit. The company is yet again on the threshold of its next stage of sustained 
growth and profitability.<br>
<br>
OCI gives great importance to maintain. With that in mind detailed activities 
and procedures have been laid down, which management believes will also bring in 
better productivity as also healthy work atmosphere. Oman Cables established a 
separate HSE department two years ago to give thrust to Health, Safety and 
Environment, yet OCI has become a proud example for HSE amongst the industries 
in Rusayl Industrial Estate. The company has been recognized for its HSE 
performance by the Ministry of Environment. The AGM in 2006 approved to 
distribute RO.50,000 for the different needs of the Omani society besides other 
contributions for diverse humanitarian activities. OCI has donated RO.20,000 to 
the Ministry of Health, for use of the needy patients, who require expensive and 
special treatments.</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Buoyant demand side and a sharp rise in the price of copper and other 
commodities have benefited OCI. Volume growth is expected to continue due to the 
ongoing expansion at Plant 2. The success of the company over last few years can 
be attributed to the consistent scaling up of production with an eye on the 
burgeoning demand from power transmission/distribution and construction sectors. 
We believe from a revenue perspective, the company should continue to grow at an 
average 50-60 per cent in 2007 due to expansions and volume growth. However, 
margins achieved in FY2006 may not be sustained, and hence, profit growth could 
trail behind the top line. – <b>Vision</b><br>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman Cables witnessed a whopping growth of 266 per cent in its bottomline to 
RO9.537 million during 2006. The company has planned well its capacity addition 
in a robust demand scenario. With new capacities and healthy demand the earnings 
growth is bound to remain intact. We expect the company to register an EPS of 
133 baiza for FY 2007, which is 10.3X its CMP of RO1.370. The company has been 
        able to take advantage of the growing demand for power cables (high 
        voltage, low voltage) in the region. We believe, with the regional 
        governments spending liberally on the infrastructure front, the demand 
        for the products of Oman Cable would continue to be buoyant. In 
        addition, the economic reform process has enabled private sector to play 
        a major role in the infrastructure sector. This is likely to step up 
        pace in the development and companies like Oman Cable are bound to be 
        beneficiaries. – <b>GIS</b></font></li>

<b>Realising the growing stature of Oman’s oil and gas industry, Atlas Copco, the 
world’s only manufacturer of ISO certified oil-free air compressors, opted for 
Oman as the venue of its first Oil and Gas MaXimiZe course. Sunil Kumar Singh 
caught up with the organisers</b><br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="pass1.jpg" width="350" height="184" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>The application of value-adding technology remains one of the top-end 
requirements of Oman’s oil and gas industry, not only to inflate production but 
also to ensure the safety and quality of production processes. Since more and 
more countries in the region are benefiting from breakthroughs in air 
compressing technology, it’s now time for the domestic oil and gas industry to 
catch up.<br>
<br>
This was the central message of the four-day special convention held in Muscat 
from March 24-28, 2007, organised by Atlas Copco, the Sweden-based world-leading 
manufacturer of air compressors, having its regional headquarters in Manama, 
Bahrain. Called ‘MaXimiZe’, the course was the first of its kind to be organised 
by Atlas Copco in the world, specifically for the oil and gas business, and Oman 
was chosen as the first destination for it. As Henk Brouwer, Vice-President, 
Marketing, Oil-free Air Division, Atlas Copco, said: “The aim of this course is 
to introduce new technology such as the oil-free compressed air technology and 
Class-Zero technology to this market. In Oman there has been increasing 
investment in oil and gas industries, and this course was the obvious step for 
us to make use of our global experiences in this region. Delegates attending 
this course, who are working with the oil and gas section of Atlas Copco, would 
provide a suitable forum to share their experiences with our partners in Oman.”
<br>
<br>
<b>Global experiences brought home<br>
</b>The ‘MaXimiZe’ course saw the participation of over 100 Atlas Copco specialists 
from 28 different nationalities to share their global experiences on the quality 
and safety requirements of the Oil and Gas sector. “It’s through events such as 
these that we gain an even better understanding of how to accompany our 
customers, whether in hazardous processes on platforms, nitrogen generation, in 
downstream applications, or control and instrument air,” said Emile Bado, 
Regional General Manager of Atlas Copco Services Middle East, adding, “In 
exploration, we are seeing a shift from piston compressed air technology to 
screw technology. This change is increasingly affecting operations in the Middle 
East. And as a general rule, customers world-wide are showing an enhanced 
concern for quality and for the safety of their operations.”<br>
<br>
Currently, Atlas Copco’s oil-free air rotary screw compressors are also the only 
ones in the world that have been certified by TÜV (German Technical Monitoring 
Association) as ISO 8573-1 Class Zero compliant. That means the compressors are 
100 per cent oil-free and eliminate risk of air contamination by oil, thus 
ensuring air purity, product quality and increased safety and productivity. 
Contamination of air by even trace quantities of hydrocarbons (in the form of 
aerosols, liquid or vapour) can result in damaged batches or products, high 
rejection rates and returns, as well as costly production downtime and clean-up, 
besides environmental pollution. Industries who risk contaminating their 
products with oil may expose themselves to product recalls, legal action and 
negative consequences, thereby having a bearing on company’s reputation and 
brand equity.</font><p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>Business opportunities galore<br>
</b>For more than 15 years, Atlas Copco has been selling its products such as gas 
equipment, generators, construction mining equipment, industrial tools, among 
others, through its distributor – Bin Salim Enterprises – to many players in 
Oman. Asked about the business opportunities in Oman, Emile replies, “Oman is a 
hidden treasure of the Middle-East. It is unspoiled and has undiscovered 
potentials. Our compressor business is 50 per cent of the total turnover of 
Atlas Copco in Oman and Oman represents 10 per cent of our total turnover in the 
Gulf region.”<br>
<br>
Since oil and gas is the major industry in Oman, it’s the largest buyer of Atlas 
Copco’s products. However, the company is also seeing immense business 
opportunities in sectors other than oil and gas too, as air compressors have 
their applications in a range of industries, such as food and beverage 
processing, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, aluminium, automotive paint spraying 
and ceramic as well as textile manufacturing. Due to the rapid industrialisation 
in Sohar and other industrial pockets, Atlas Copco is upbeat on business 
prospects in the Oman market. “Oman for us is very important because of the Oil 
and Gas industry as well as other mega projects that are coming up in Sohar, 
Sur, etc. Oman is experiencing a rapid boom due to high oil prices that has 
prompted increased investments in other industries, besides oil and gas. Last 
year, we got one of the largest orders from the region from Sohar,” he said.<br>
<br>
Air compressor units are the core of any industrial plant and with the economic 
diversification drive, almost all the industries coming up in Oman will have a 
need for compressed air systems. The MaXimiZe course was an attempt to create 
awareness about the products that are not only cost effective, result in better 
productivity but are also environment-friendly.

      <p align="justify"><font color="#CC3300" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Why oil-free air compressors?</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
      <br>
      <b>Increased safety</b>: Oil-free Air compressors compress air without the use of any 
oil for cooling or sealing in the compressed air chamber. The clean, pure, 
oil-free air is delivered into the compressed air system without any risk of 
contamination. The high quality of manufacturing required to ensure maximum 
efficiency provides additional safety to the user.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Increased uptime</b>: Compressed air is used to operate and actuate specific 
instruments and control valves. Even trace amounts of oil in the compressed air 
can cause the malfunctioning of this responsive equipment. Maintenance means 
downtime and increased costs. Oil-injected compressors need regular oil filing 
and frequent filter changes to prevent air contamination and serious shutdown 
conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Purer gas</b>: Separated using membrane technology, compressed air provides nitrogen 
blankets critical in LNG tankers, transfer stations or the catalysts and 
reactors in a downstream segment application. Oil-free compressed air assures 
longer membrane service life avoiding frequent and costly membrane replacements.<br>

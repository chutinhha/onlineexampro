<img border="0" src="management.jpg" width="156" height="255" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Managers devote time to strategy-making because they want some degree of 
certainty that they can direct their firm towards success. The mass of strategy 
literature suggests two dimensions along which this certainty might be 
influenced. <br>
<br>
The first is prediction. If the future can be predicted, the manager can drive 
the firm to a position where it will have an advantage. The second is control. 
If the manager can create a favorable environment, the firm will have an 
advantage. These are not alternatives, but rather levers managers might apply to 
determine the best strategy to pursue in their company’s environment. Using 
prediction and control as levers, I can organize everything I know about 
strategic thinking into one of the following four categories:<br>
<br>
<b>Planning and adaptation</b><br>
According to much current mainstream strategic-management thinking, firms should 
either try harder to predict better (plan) or move faster in response to changes 
in the environment (adapt). Which prescription a company follows depends upon 
how confident it is in its ability to predict changes in the environment. But 
both of these approaches rely on the firm’s ability to understand and make sense 
out of the environment in order to set strategy.<br>
<br>
<b>Visionary and transformation</b><br>
But there is a more proactive managerial approach to the environment. If 
managers have market power (say, working for a government or for Microsoft), 
they can dictate what will happen in the environment, imposing their view 
(visionary) on the landscape and ensuring the position of their organization 
within that environment. For a more typical organization, one without that type 
of power, partners and customers can be enlisted to jointly create (transform) 
the environment, developing a new product, company or even market.<br>
<br>
What I’ve proposed so far is theoretical; let’s see what it looks like in 
practice. Imagine a popular independent radio station, KEEP180, that plays a 
wide range of new music from country and western to French rap. The station 
broadcasts locally, and has a growing online audience. It’s funded by donations 
from listeners, and is facing a strategic decision about where to invest its 
limited resources. What should it do next?<br>
<br>
<b>Planning</b>. The station might carry out market research and predict an explosion 
in a new genre of French music. It could then invest in bringing that music to 
its audience and consequently capitalize on higher ratings.<br>
<br>
<b>Visionary</b>. Alternatively, the producers at KEEP180 may simply love the French 
language, and may build a format exclusively on French rap and other novel 
French music, knowing they will own the category if they can establish it.<br>
<br>
<b>Adaptation</b>. Given the high rate of change in technology and customer demand, the 
station might devote its efforts to watching other independent stations and 
talking with customers, ready to move quickly as new trends are identified.<br>
<br>
<b>Transformation</b>. Finally, the station might partner with a French recording label 
and a current American music icon to create an explosion in French rap music, 
selling music online, where all of them profit from the new environment that 
they create together.<br>
<br>
From this exercise, you can hopefully imagine each course of action to be 
plausible. And while your intuition may identify one as most effective, what I 
hope you see is the assumptions each makes. Planning assumes that information, 
particularly historical information from the environment, is reliable enough to 
provide a base for your strategy. Visionary assumes you have enough power to 
impose a solution on the environment.<br>
Adaptation assumes you are faster to respond to changes than your competitors. 
And transformation assumes you can put together partnerships which will 
successfully create a new situation.<br>
<br>
<b>PREDICT IF YOU CAN, BUT BEWARE OF UNCERTAINTY</b><br>
Most strategy today is based on prediction and planning. Market research, 
scenario planning, revenue forecasts, comparables analysis and real options are 
all popular and common strategies that demand access to reliable historical 
data.<br>
<br>
But the increasing level of uncertainty generated by fickle customers, creative 
competitors and even government regulation renders those thoughtful predictions 
useless. Visionary approaches are only viable for a small number of already 
powerful organizations. And adaptation offers little sustainable advantage as 
competitors have access to the same information.<br>
<br>
This explains recent interest in transformational strategies, not reliant on 
prediction, that give the manager access to the alternative lever of control. 
Characteristics of transformational strategies include:<br>
<br>
<b>Starting with your means</b>. Take action based on what your company has available 
(what you have, what you know and whom you know) instead of trying to set goals 
to reach a predicted optimal position.<br>
<br>
<b>Setting affordable loss</b>. Pursue interesting opportunities without investing more 
resources than you can afford to lose. Set a limit on downside potential.<br>
<br>
<b>Forming partnerships</b>. Strategy is created jointly through partnerships to create 
new opportunities where everyone who commits benefits.<br>
<br>
<b>Leveraging contingencies</b>. Surprises are good. New developments encourage 
imaginative rethinking of possibilities and continual transformation of targets.<br>
<br>
The next time you sit down to think about strategy, consider which of the four 
quadrants – planning (market sensing), adaptation (learning orientation), 
visionary (market power), tranformation (nonpredictive control) – you are in. 
What to assume about the predictability or controllability of the environment? 
Does your approach match the situation? Remember that to the extent you can 
predict the future, you can control it. But to the extent you can control it, 
you don’t need to predict it.<br>

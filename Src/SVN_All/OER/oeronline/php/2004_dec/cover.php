            OER chronicles major local, regional and international events that 
            shaped 2004, a year that will probably go down in history as the 
            year when expensive oil became reality. </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <b>We look back at the fading backdrop of the year that was, and 
            attempt to catalogue, analyse, investigate, scrutinise, dissect, 
            evaluate and probe the key events that had or are expected to have a 
            major impact on the region’s business and economy in general, and 
            that of Oman in particular<br>
            </b><br>
            <img border="0" src="cover1.jpg" align="left" width="215" height="225">There 
            are no uneventful years. Only years that whiz past you faster than 
            you can say “Turmoil!” As 2004 takes its final step towards being 
            etched into history, the one thing that the year will surely be 
            remembered for is the oil price gone crazy. From an average of $31 
            per barrel in 2003, the price of the benchmark West Texas 
            Intermediary (WTI) peaked around $51 per barrel in early September, 
            and was hovering around the $49-mark at the time OER went to Press 
            in late November. Despite the war in Iraq getting over last year, 
            the continuing geopolitical instability in the region ensured that 
            the ‘fear premium’ remained high. <br>
            The reasons for such a high price, according to analysts, vary from 
            the steady increase in the Asian economies’ thirst for oil to the 
            mixed signals sent by the Russian government with regard to Yukos’ 
            future and the speculative activity on the part of market movers. 
            The truth may be a combination of all of these, and much more. <br>
            Another reason that is being cited now more regularly than ever 
            before for the spiralling oil price is the systematic and utter 
            dominance of the once brawny dollar by currencies such as the pound, 
            the yen and the euro. From a little less than a dollar to the euro 
            in January 2003, it takes $1.32 to buy a euro today (November 26, 
            2004), an increase of over 33 per cent in a matter of less than two 
            years. The London P.M. gold price, or the afternoon fix as it is 
            more popularly known as, ended 2003 at $417.25 which, incidentally, 
            was that year’s highest quoted price, and is today hovering around 
            $451 (November 26, 2004). <br>
            <img border="0" src="im1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="120" height="201">The passing year saw the re-election of US President George W. Bush 
            Jr for a second term in office, defeating John Kerry by a margin of 
            3 per cent of popular votes. This happened in the same year that saw 
            the unearthing of the Abu Gharib prison abuse scandal, in which 
            haunting images of Iraqi prisoners’ abuse by some of the US and 
            British troops were splashed across the media in US and elsewhere.
            <br>
            The year witnessed the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and 
            UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the month of 
            November, and that of former US president Ronald Reagan’s in June. 
            In the worst natural disaster of the year, an Earthquake, measuring 
            6.4 on the Richter scale, killed as many as 628 people near north 
            coast of Morocco on February 24, 2003. While OER has no record of 
            the number of lives lost in ‘man-made’ disasters, some estimates put 
            the death toll in just Iraq this year as high as over 10,000. <br>
            The year 2004 wasn’t all about bad news, though. The Rover landed on 
            Mars amid hopes that there might have been life on the planet. Two 
            new chemical elements—Ununtrium and Ununpentium—were created while 
            scientists in South Korea announced to have cloned human embryos. 
            Ten new countries joined the 
            <img border="0" src="im2.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="200" height="149">European Union, bringing the number of 
            member states grew to 25. The 63-year-old Michael Melvil became the 
            first civilian pilot to steer a spaceship. <br>
            Closer home, UAE-based group won two mobile phone licences in Saudi 
            Arabia while Oman itself witnessed huge advances in its 
            privatisation drive, with the second mobile licence being awarded to 
            Nawras Telecom, a consortia led by Qatar’s Q-Tel, in June. In 
            anticipation, the government formed a new mobile company, Oman 
            Mobile, in March, and slashed tariff rates by up to 30 per cent. <br>
            Oman’s media law was also amended, with the new law allowing 
            privately owned radio and TV stations to be set up in the country. 
            The Ministry of Manpower signed training agreements worth RO1.7 
            million with companies in the private sector in August. According to 
            ministry statistics, 54,885 male and female job seekers were 
            enrolled at the ministry from January 1, 2004 to October 31, 2004. 
            And, 9,020 male and female citizens were selected for vacant posts 
            in the private sector while 31,202 job opportunities were availed in 
            the public sector. <br>
            <img border="0" src="im3.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2" width="200" height="164">True to its promise of giving the tourism sector a boost, the 
            country saw the establishment of the Ministry of Tourism in June, 
            with HE Rajha bint Abdulameer, formerly undersecretary at the 
            Ministry of National Economy, being appointed as the Minister of 
            Tourism. The Sultanate also saw the launch of a host of development 
            initiatives, including the unveiling of $805-million The Wave 
            seafront resort tourism project. The government relaxed the 
            country’s property laws, allowing GCC nationals to own property in 
            the Sultanate. The country saw impressive advances in its stock 
            market, the Muscat Securities Market (MSM), with the index posting 
            over 25 per cent improvement over its 2003-end figures.<br>
            Hindsight is always 20:20. Whether disasters could have been averted 
            or better progress made in the time now past has been and will 
            always remain open for debate. But that is what life is all about – 
            a potent mix of struggles won and lost, opportunities missed and 
            gained, and feats accomplished and failed. <br>
            While we acknowledge that it is, of course, impossible to capture 
            all the events and happenings of the year in a few pages, this is 
            our attempt at chronicling the major events that we think may have 
            an impact on the time to come. <br>

            <b>Budget 2004 unveiled</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="im4a.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="194">HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, the minister for national economy and 
            vice-president of the Financial Affairs &amp; Energy Resources Council, 
            announced a growth-oriented deficit budget. Projected revenue and 
            expenditure were RO2,925 million and RO3,425 million, respectively, 
            leaving an anticipated deficit of RO500 million. The government was 
            planning to borrow RO240 million from domestic and overseas markets 
            to partially cover the budget deficit. However, this deficit of 
            RO500 million was based on a projected conservative average oil 
            price of $21 per barrel. With Oman’s crude oil price for the month 
            of May 2004 reaching $35.45 per barrel, the highest for 20 years, 
            the projected deficit should have turned into a surplus. However, 
            declining PDO production may have reduced the amount of final 
            surplus recorded in 2004.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Budget Highlights</b><br>
            • Negative growth of 9 per cent in GDP due to anticipated decline in 
            production.<br>
            • Oil production estimated to drop to 710,000 bpd against 763,000 
            bpd budgeted in 2003.<br>
            • RO500 million deficit budgeted based on oil price of $21 per 
            barrel.<br>
            • Investment expenditure projected at RO912 million - an increase of 
            48 per cent arising mainly from LNG and oil condensate investment 
            expenditure of RO255 million.<br>
            • Corporate tax revenue budgeted at RO55 million.<br>
            • Customs revenue estimated to rise by 10 per cent to RO55 million.<br>
            • The government was to divest 30% of Omantel’s equity.<br>

            Oman’s largest tourism development project till date—The Wave

            pristine beachfront just west of Muscat and occupying 195 hectares 
            (2mn sq m), the $805 million (RO 310mn) resort project is being 
            developed with the help of the Dubai-based Majid al Futtaim Group, 
            which committed RO35mn to develop Phase I of The Wave later in 
            September 2004. The project involves land reclamation, 
            infrastructure development and site improvement including a golf 
            course and a marina.<br>
            ‘‘The Wave is designed to contribute to the experience of Oman, a 
            country with a fascinating heritage and astonishing natural 
            beauty,’’ explained HE Mohsin bin Khamis Al-Balushi, Oman’s

            vision for The Wave which will be a fully integrated premium tourism 
            and residential resort in Oman. The country offers graceful living 
            in an authentic atmosphere unspoiled by commercial excesses, and is 
            not flooded by low-end package tours,” he had said at that time. The

            equity, and domestic and international investors were invited to 
            join forces with the government.</font></p>

            <b>Halliburton accused of overcharging for gas </b><br>
            Two former employees claimed that the oil services company, which 
            secured no-bid contracts for reconstruction projects in Iraq, 
            “routinely overcharged” the US military. Halliburton, formerly 
            headed by US vice-president Dick Cheney from 1995 to 2000, was under 
            investigation by several government agencies. <br>
            The company drew criticism from Senator John Kerry and other 
            Democrats during the election campaign later in the year because of 
            the no-bid contracts it received for much of the Iraqi work, 
            especially after military auditors found evidence of possible 
            overcharging for some work.<br>
            Halliburton executives said previously they expected criticism to 
            die down after the election and that the company's share price, 
            which trades at a discount to its peers such as Schlumberger and 
            Baker Hughes Inc., would rebound. But the company still faces a 
            number of problems over its Iraq contracts. <br>
            In the latest move, the US Army Corps of Engineers’ top contracting 
            official called for an investigation into the award the of 
            multi-billion dollar contracts to Halliburton, calling it the worst 
            case of contracting abuse she had seen. <br>
            Bunnatine Greenhouse, in a television interview, said, ‘‘It was 
            misconduct, and part of the misconduct was blatant.’’ At the centre 
            of Greenhouse’s complaint is a no-bid contract worth $7 billion 
            (RO2.7 billion) awarded last year to KBR to rebuild Iraq’s oil 
            industry. US auditors have also accused KBR of being unable to 
            account for over a third of the items it handled in Kuwait under a 
            work order for the US occupation authority in Iraq. <br>
            In addition, the US Army is threatening to withhold payment of 15 
            per cent, or about $600 million (RO230.77 million), of Halliburton’s 
            bills because of a dispute over whether KBR properly documented its 
            bills for feeding and housing troops in Iraq and Kuwait. Halliburton 
            has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its work in Iraq, where 
            KBR’s contracts have brought in $5.2 billion (RO2 billion) in 
            revenues so far this year (till November) and about $8.8 billion 
            (RO3.38 billion) since the start of the war last year. <br>

            <b>GCC citizens can own property in Oman</b><br>
            A Royal Decree was issued allowing citizens of the Gulf Cooperation 
            Council (GCC) to own property in Oman. “GCC citizens would be 
            allowed to rent and own built real estate or land for the purpose of 
            residence or investment in any member state and would be treated as 
            citizens of the state where the real estate was situated,” said the 
            decree. But land acquired by a GCC citizen in Oman would have to be

            Scientists in South Korea announced that they had created 30 human 
            embryos by cloning. The scientists had taken the genetic material

            The resulting embryos were then grown up to produce so-called stem 
            cells that could divide into any tissue in the body. The aim was to 
            use the cells to replace ones that had failed in patients with 
            problems such as Alzheimer’s disease. <br>

            Qaboos Bin Said had issued a Royal Decree on February 9, 1994, 
            establishing Oman LNG as one of the Sultanate’s biggest new 
            industries. Oman LNG is one of the leading companies in the global 
            LNG industry. It was reported that investments in the country’s 
            manufacturing sector had witnessed an annual growth of 44 per cent 
            during 1997-2001, significantly because of the commencement of LNG 
            production. Oman LNG, who would be setting up its third train of LNG

            protons and neutrons in their nuclei than any naturally occurring 
            elements found on Earth. The discovery would encourage researchers 
            hoping to fill apparent gaps in the periodic table with ‘islands’ of 
            stable, massive atoms that may exhibit new chemical properties and

            In a State visit that marked Britain’s willingness to welcome Libya 
            back into the international community, British PM Tony Blair met 
            with Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi, saying that the two shared a 
            common goal in defeating the al-Qaeda terrorist network. The British 
            PM and the Libyan leader promised to battle terrorism. <br>
            The visit ended nearly 30 years of diplomatic isolation of Libya, 
            which announced that it would surrender its nuclear weapons. Blair 
            promised not to forget “the pain of past actions,” such as the 1988 
            Lockerbie bombing by Libyan agents, which killed 270 people. But he 
            added that Libya should be welcomed back into the international 
            fold. <br>
            Britain has taken the diplomatic lead in ending Libya’s 
            international isolation, and Blair’s visit—the first by a British 
            leader since Gaddafi seized power in 1969—was seen as Gaddafi’s 
            reward for dismantling his nuclear weapons program and renouncing

            bundling its products, such as Windows Media Player, with its 
            operating system. The EC ordered the company to sell a version of 
            Windows in Europe with Windows Media Player software code stripped 
            out. <br>
            This ruling raised the threat that the EC would regulate how 
            Microsoft integrates new features into Windows. Microsoft had also 
            been ordered to provide valuable proprietary software code and 
            technical information to competing companies. Steve Ballmer, chief 
            executive officer of Microsoft, had said that in spite of the

            allow US firms to buy Libya’s oil and invest in its economy for the 
            first time since 1986 in a reward for Tripoli giving up weapons of 
            mass destruction. <br>
            White House spokesman Scott McClellan made it clear that the US 
            actions stemmed from Libya’s surprise decision on December 19, 2003, 
            to give up its pursuit of chemical, biological and nuclear arms, and 
            its work since to eliminate its stockpiles and programs. ‘‘Libya has

            access to sound money that is not weakened by inflation rates, the 
            freedom to exchange goods and services with foreigners and the 
            degree to which business and credit and labour markets were

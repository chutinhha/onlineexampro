		<b><font face="Verdana" size="4">The Experience Trap</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
		<b>When companies look for a manager, they should look for experience, 
		right? Well, may be not. INSEAD professors Kishore Sengupta and Luk Van 
		Wassenhove say their research has revealed what they call the 
		“experience trap”</b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br>
		</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
		“Conventional wisdom holds that as we do more things more often, we 
		learn from experience and get better and better, and what we found in 
		our research was that actually some of it may not be the case,” Sengupta 
		says.<br>
		<br>
		Sengupta is an Associate Professor of Information Systems and Van 
		Wassenhove is Professor of Operations Management and Director of the 
		INSEAD Social Innovation Centre. What they found was that in big complex 
		projects managers tend to draw on experience that doesn’t help, or 
		actually hurts the project.<br>
		<br>
		In their research, they found that experienced managers applied the 
		wrong lessons, didn’t link the right lessons with outcomes, or were 
		given erroneous objectives or unhelpful feedback. It all adds up to 
		extra problems in project management.<br>
		<br>
		“Managers tend to learn the wrong lessons and apply them again and again 
		in a way that’s fundamentally counterproductive,” Sengupta says.<br>
		<b><br>
		Developing products</b><br>
		Sengupta and Van Wassenhove used an intriguing simulation that mimics a 
		real project development environment. As managers go through the 
		simulation, they have a number of decisions to make. Many managers ran 
		through the simulation and made errors. Then they got some feedback and 
		tried the simulation again – and made the same mistakes.<br>
		<br>
		“These things are deeply ingrained into their experience,” Van 
		Wassenhove says. “You have to help them unlearn what they’ve learned and 
		give them tools so they can avoid these types of mistakes.”<br>
		<br>
		A common mistake is in starting a project with one goal or one budget. 
		Then when some of the variables change, as they always do in projects, 
		managers decide to add staff but they fail to take into account time 
		lags in hiring and training people, and projects end up late and 
		over-budget. This is particularly true in software development, but 
		Sengupta and Van Wassenhove say the lessons are widely applicable.<br>
		<br>
		“Most projects are complex in that the decision you take now, you see 
		the effect later,” Van Wassenhove says. “Believing that experience will 
		help you and then trusting that experience blindly without questioning 
		the knowledge in the new situation is very tricky.”<br>
		<br>
		It’s not that managers aren’t smart, but projects are very complex, so 
		managers make a lot of decisions over time and often for many projects 
		at the same time. That makes it difficult for them to see the lessons 
		they should be learning and to apply them to future projects.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Keeping track</b><br>
		“If you are running 20 projects and you’re dealing with a couple of 
		hundred people and all these projects are in different stages of 
		completion, it’s very easy to fix something here and something there, 
		and you lose track of action outcomes,” Van Wassenhove says.<br>
		<br>
		Estimates, goals and incentives are often unrealistic at the start of a 
		project and as the projects progress, things change and become more 
		complex. Often, the project managers actually know that the goals and 
		estimates are unreliable from the outset. But business culture dictates 
		that managers shouldn’t renegotiate or readjust, even when they have new 
		information.<br>
		<br>
		“It creates a certain dynamic, which leads to projects becoming more and 
		more unproductive,” Sengupta says. Instead, companies should look at 
		goals that induce the behaviour they want to foster and then constantly 
		review the goals to make sure they are creating the right behaviour and 
		outcomes.<br>
		<br>
		What’s more, managers don’t get the right feedback either. They get lots 
		of reports and information, but it’s not always very insightful and 
		doesn’t connect actions with outcomes.<br>
		<br>
		Sengupta says it’s not as though companies don’t have the information or 
		they don’t want to give it to managers, but “they don’t give it in a way 
		that the managers can understand what’s going on and draw conclusions 
		that can help them in this and future projects.”<br>

		<br>
		<b>While political tensions in the Middle East often grab international 
		headlines, relatively little is written about a growing source of 
		stability within the region. The rise of a diversified, open economy is 
		no longer exclusively dependent on oil revenues, says a report by Booz 
		Allen Hamilton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>
		<img border="0" src="inthenews8.jpg" width="200" height="291" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="3"></b>The region’s economic development continues to gain momentum, despite 
		being largely unrecognised. If this economic oasis can flower, it 
		suggests that the future of the Middle East is more hopeful – and more 
		complex, than many realise.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Scepticism and sustainability</b><br>
		Deregulation and privatisation have become tangible very recently in the 
		Middle East, leading people to question: if this seeming mirage is real, 
		then why now? What is spurring it?<br>
		<br>
		“Today, oil-producing countries, mainly those in the Gulf, use extra 
		revenue to reduce foreign debt, boost liquidity, develop trade ties and 
		attract foreign investment,” points out Joe Saddi, Senior Vice President 
		with Booz Allen Hamilton. They are determined to build wealth for 
		themselves and make the current oil boom pay off in the long run. 
		Governments are looking at a number of ways to achieve sustainable 
		wealth. They realise they must develop a middle class, along with the 
		sort of job base that can sustain it. In a region where half of the 
		population is below the age of 20 – and where the unemployment rates can 
		be considerable – a sustainable middle class is an even more viable 
		solution to long lasting economic expansion and political stability.<br>
		<br>
		Today’s Middle East is different; “The region’s leaders are committed to 
		catching up to, and in many cases, surpassing the rest of the world in 
		terms of economic vitality,” adds Richard Shediac, Vice President with 
		Booz Allen Hamilton. This is largely due to visionary individuals in 
		positions of authority who are eager for progress and willing to move 
		quickly.<br>
		<br>
		However, the region’s progress often goes unseen due to stereotyping and 
		the region being misunderstood. There are a number of innate paradoxes 
		governing the mind of the Middle East decision makers and which are 
		essential facets of the region’s business culture. Understanding the 
		attitudes and assumptions that shape the way business is conducted makes 
		it easier to recognise future opportunities and navigate the challenges 
		that lie ahead.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Late yet eager</b><br>
		Those familiar with business in the Middle East will recognise a 
		specific rhythm. Economic developments move with astonishing rapidity – 
		following a long period of incubation before a decision is finally made.<br>
		<br>
		The deregulation of the telecommunications sector in Saudi Arabia 
		started in 1998. The industry operated like many other sectors in the 
		Middle East, but Saudi Arabia decided to open it up to competition, 
		spurred by a desire to become more efficient and by an interest in 
		joining the WTO. “Only four years later, the Saudi Telecommunications 
		Company sold 30 per cent of its shares in a public offering valued at 
		around US$4 billion,” stressed Karim Sabbagh, Vice President with Booz 
		Allen Hamilton. Investors demonstrated the market’s readiness by 
		offering to buy US$9.6 billion worth of shares. Overall, the 
		deregulation has had major effects on quality of service and pricing.<br>
		<br>
		The ‘late yet eager’ mentality may reflect regional leaders’ desire to 
		avoid laissez-faire economics, by developing legislation that enables 
		smooth transition and restructuring of state-owned companies. This 
		cautious approach ensures privatisation efforts are successful and that 
		new entrants can enter the market at a favourable time.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Risk averse yet bold</b><br>
		The desire to modernise rapidly is expressed in bold, creative decision 
		making. Some leaders took brash actions to effect change and send 
		signals to the private sector and society. The private sector then 
		followed suit – Palm Island and other initiatives in the UAE are 
		examples of daring actions that created the momentum for change. Bold 
		decision-making in one key project sets the course for others to follow.<br>
		<br>
		“The need for bold steps to turn around education systems is felt 
		strongly in the labour-abundant and resource-poor countries of the 
		region,” Shediac emphasised. In boasting; ‘our people are our greatest 
		asset,’ Jordan’s education reform for the knowledge economy initiative 
		brought together 17 domestic organisations, 17 global corporations, and 
		11 governmental and non-governmental organisations to implement a 
		public-private partnership model in 2003. Information and communications 
		technology (ICT) firms sought to develop local high-tech skills, 
		hundreds of schools were refurbished, teachers trained and the entire 
		Jordanian public school system will soon be connected by a high-speed 
		broadband network. Qatar’s leaders have prioritised creating a 
		cutting-edge school system that harnesses technology for learning. The 
		country’s Supreme Education Council (SEC) is playing an integral role in 
		the development and implementation of major reform in the schools.<br>
		<br>
		Saudi Arabia too has made a similar bold commitment to progress, with 
		the setting up of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology 
		– an international, graduate-level research university dedicated to 
		scientific achievement.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Traditional yet progressive</b><br>
		Decision-makers in the Middle East are fundamentally progressive, 
		despite the region being tradition-bound. They face the challenge of how 
		to grow and prosper without losing their cultural identity and there is 
		a constant tension between modernising and Westernising in the region. 
		Modernisation is valued - within traditional parameters.<br>
		“The Islamic banking system guided by Sharia law highlights the 
		tension,” points out Shediac. Modern Islamic banking has emerged and the 
		region is the incubator for this industry, which is growing at a global 
		annual rate of 15 to 20 per cent.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Focused yet flexible</b><br>
		In today’s global market, fixed business plans don’t exist, and in the 
		Middle East, decision-makers tend to follow a five-year planning cycle, 
		but never consider these plans to be permanent. They realise the 
		importance of a clear direction, but with so many economic changes, 
		strategies must be open to rapid change. A market that is regulated one 
		day may be deregulated the next: focus and flexibility must go hand in 
		hand.<br>
		Governments facing challenges in opening up the economy to foreign 
		investment are developing special economic zones, luring capital to 
		contained, controlled environments. “Many Middle Eastern countries are 
		experimenting with smaller economic oases that limit risk – a sign of 
		focused, yet flexible, planning and a change from attempting 
		transformation on a national level,” avers Shediac.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Ambiguous yet determined</b><br>
		Outsiders may not recognise the depth of the region’s determination to 
		grow economically, from pushing to replicating practices that have 
		proved successful elsewhere. The Middle East’s leaders are seeking to 
		learn from the experiences of others, while adopting tailored solutions 
		that will work best within their countries. “Democracy is one such issue 
		in which the region is consistently progressing,” Shediac outlines. Some 
		parts of the MENA region introduced universal suffrage early on, 
		including Lebanon (1952), Egypt (1956), Morocco (1963), and Jordan 
		(1974).<br>
		<br>
		Other parts are introducing gradual reforms. During the recent 
		restructuring of the Abu Dhabi government, a foundation was laid for 
		municipal councils with local representation. Similarly, Saudi Arabia 
		introduced elections at the municipal level in 2005. Women have begun to 
		stand as candidates in these elections; they have been elected to the 
		chamber of commerce and industry in Jeddah. In 2006, Kuwait allowed for 
		the first time women to contest and vote in the country’ parliamentary 
		elections.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Exclusive yet diverse</b><br>
		Human capital is increasingly important as the region’s economy moves 
		away from oil dependency. The region is welcoming diverse talent and is 
		ensuring it can retain this talent, while nurturing its own.<br>
		<br>
		The ‘exclusive yet diverse’ tension in the region extends to the 
		financial capital. In a bid to attract foreign investment, a number of 
		Middle Eastern countries have begun to allow non-nationals to own 
		property, thus increasing the number of long-term residents who create 
		wealth and add diversity to the population.<br>
		“Incentives have also been implemented for non-nationals who want to 
		participate in capital markets; such incentives attract a higher rate of 
		investment and accelerate development,” Saddi emphasises. This has 
		prompted professionalism and transparency to increase in the region.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The road to oasis</b><br>
		“The emergence of a new regional, diversified economy is a fundamental 
		shift that will affect corporate investment and geopolitical activity,” 
		adds Sabbagh. The Middle East may be developing a new type of economy, 
		different from any other that has preceded it.<br>
		This phenomenon is being spurred by a broad group of decision-makers 
		trying to build a bridge between the Middle East culture and its 
		economic potential. They understand that if the region is to thrive, 
		they must foster the innate entrepreneurial spirit of their people, 
		create the solid infrastructure needed to compete on a global level and 
		provide a range of middle-class opportunities to people who would 
		otherwise be disenfranchised. If they manage to create this unique 
		economy, the oasis blooming today won’t be a mirage, but an attractive, 
		sustainable, fertile valley. <br>

		UAE hotels produce double CO2 emissions compared to Europe</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
		Five-star hotels in the UAE are producing twice as much CO2 compared to 
		similar hotels in Europe, according to an award-winning study on carbon 
		emissions by the hotel industry. The study, undertaken by Farnek Avireal, 
		the Dubai-based facilities management company , found that on average, a 
		5-star hotel in Dubai produced 6,500 tonnes of CO2 annually while a 
		similar hotel in Europe produced only 3,000 tonnes. Furthermore, Dubai 
		hotels on average consumed between 275 to 325kw/h of power per guest, 
		compared to 100kw/h per guest in a similar hotel in Germany, a 
		difference of 225 per cent.<br>
		<br>
		“The combined output of CO2 from Dubai’s 300 hotels is approximately 
		500,000kg,” said Markus Avireal, the company’s general manager. “We 
		estimate that hotels can save between 25 to 30 per cent of the current 
		energy consumption by using energy efficient technology. This technology 
		is particularly useful for properties in hot climates, where cooling

		initiated US$1.6-billion worth of projects in the Central African 
		Republic (CAR). One of its prominent ventures will be the Cite Lumiere, 
		the Central African region’s first special economic zone.<br>
		<br>
		Commenting on the potential of the Central African Republic, IAS 
		chairman Issam Abu Issa said: “This development represents a turnaround 
		point for the CAR and the region. It is our objective to create one of 
		the first free zones in Central Africa, which we are confident will help 
		CAR to become a future super hub and become a catalyst for its extensive 
		economic growth and development. Investors from around the globe are 
		becoming increasingly aware of the range of opportunities here.”<br>
		<br>
		IAS has already invested in CAR, including in gold and diamond, oil and 
		gas exploration, timber, and water plants. The Cite Lumiere project will 
		consist of a central commercial district and two residential 
		communities. The total size of the commercial district will be 
		approximately 370,000 sq.m and will be divided into four zones: office 
		park; civic zone; 5 star hotel and apartments; and shopping centre and 
		4-star hotel and offices. The residential communities will be 
		approximately 1,600 separated into two communities.<br>

		Gulf Extrusions to double output</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
		Gulf Extrusions plans to double its aluminium extrusion output in the 
		next six years to meet growing demand, mainly from the construction 
		sector, in the region. The firm, one of the leading extrusion producers 
		in the Gulf Arab region, is expecting output to rise to as much as 
		100,000 tonnes, partly through building two new facilities in Qatar. 
		“There are now over US$300-billion worth of construction projects 
		planned within the next five years in the Middle East and this is 
		expected to strain the current supply of aluminium profiles,” said Modar 
		Al Mekdad, general manager with Gulf Extrusions. Extrusions are made 
		from solid cylinders called billets, which are used widely in the 
		construction industry. </font></p>

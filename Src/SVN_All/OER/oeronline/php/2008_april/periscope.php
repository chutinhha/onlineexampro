</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Making Money During a Dollar Crisis</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>The dollar’s downfall is having an effect on other currencies as well.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The beneficiary is gold</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="periscope.jpg" width="137" height="220" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">This has been the worst monthly sell-off in the US dollar since the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, which coincided with a crisis in New York 
money centre banks that almost led to the failure of Citigroup, Chase Manhattan 
and JP Morgan. The dollar’s free fall has led to an incredible surge in crude 
oil and gold, which are seen as safe havens from the Wall Street credit 
meltdown, and the spike in inflation expectations. The Federal Reserve has made 
it clear that it will allow interest rates to plunge to bail out the banking 
system, exactly as it did in 1990-91. So the Fed funds’ rate has fallen from 
5.25 per cent to 3 per cent since September and call has moved lower to 2 per 
cent as Ben Bernanke uses monetary policy as an instrument to offset the housing 
bust and the financial neutron bomb that has gutted Wall Street.<br>
<br>
The dollar’s plunge accelerated after Jean Claude Trichet suggested that the ECB 
would not cut interest rates as long as eurozone inflation stays above 3 per 
cent. The divergence<img border="0" src="periscope2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="220" height="191"> between an ultra-dovish Fed and an ultra-hawkish ECB has 
led to the meteoric ascent of the Euro/Dollar rate could change market 
sentiments. Despite Treasury Secretary Paulson’s “strong dollar” platitudes, US 
economic policy makers welcome a weaker dollar because it helps its trade 
deficit. Yet, a simultaneous plunge in US equities, financial shares, corporate 
bonds and the greenback is something a lot more ominous – a run on Wall Street. 
The emergency January 21 Fed meeting failed to revive either the stock market or 
arrest the credit meltdown in the mortgage, swaps and leveraged loan markets. 
The Fed cannot ease rates much below the core PCE, now running at 3 per cent. It 
is significant that the US Treasury bond curve continues to steepen, with short 
runs responding to Fed easy money policy while long rates rise to reflect 
inflation risk. Yet, if the capital markets price an end to Fed easing, a global 
stock market panic will result. This moment, I believe could well mark a bottom 
in the dollar.<br>
<br>
<b>Yen loses sheen</b><br>
The Japanese yen, the world’s money pump to finance carry trades in risk assets, 
is the primary beneficiary of the global equity market weakness since August. 
Yet, the Chicago IMM data suggests that the Japanese yen long is a crowded trade 
as the gnomes of the Euromarkets unwind short yen positions. The rise in 
Japanese yen volatility has reduced the attractiveness of the yen as a funding 
currency. As short positions unwind, dollar-yen falls to 100, where the risk of 
the Bank of Japan becomes very, very real. Sterling has surged to 2.02 against 
the US dollar even as it has fallen to new lows against the euro.<br>
&nbsp;Yet, British 
macroeconomic fundamentals do not justify a stronger sterling and cable’s 
strength reflects US dollar weakness. Chancellor Darling has nationalised 
Northern Rock, one-third of British homeowners are struggling to meet their 
payments, London and the City are the global capital of structured finance 
Armageddon, consumer spending on Main Street is anaemic and New Labour’s public 
finance black hole is of Third World dimensions.<br>
Yet owning sterling is a time 
bomb for investors. The Northern Rock fiasco was the most embarrassing financial 
debacle for any British government since George Soros made a billion dollar 
killing betting against the Bank of England during the ERM debacle in September 
1992. The British economy is more leveraged to finance and consumer leveraged 
than either Germany or the US. The MPC will be forced to slash interest rates 
even at the risk of higher inflation. So while the current dollar woes can take 
cable to 2.04 in the short term, I believe sterling will trade at 1.90 in the 
next six months. After all, investors in the GCC should never forget that the 
British pound is correlated to the global economic cycle and global growth is 
headed lower in the next 12 months.<br>
<br>
A similar rationale underlies my bearishness on the Australian and New Zealand 
dollar. As the Reserve Bank of Australia is on hold and Sydney is hostage to 
financial market stress, I believe industrial commodities are probably headed 
lower. This could undercut a crucial anchor of the Aussie dollar, which is 
headed lower to 0.88 against the greenback. The Kiwi dollar’s high yield status 
is also being offset by the softness in dairy prices. High interest rates will 
mean consumer spending and housing demand will weaken, meaning the Kiwi is 
vulnerable to both the US and, Aussie dollar, as also the Japanese yen.<br>
<br>
<b>Gold shines through</b><br>
South African power outages, violence in Iraqi Kurdistan and Gaza, the spike in 
inflation expectations, speculative buying by Arabian Gulf and Chinese sovereign 
wealth funds and North Sea Brent crude oil at US$105 have all combined to lead 
to all time highs in gold, higher than its 1980 peak when the Soviets invaded 
Afghanistan and the American economy was devastated by inflation. South African 
mine production is in secular decline due to power outages, closure of marginal 
mines, Zulu-Xhosa tribal politics and labour stages. The failure of two German 
banks, an Australian property developer, the Peleton Partners hedge fund and the 
Carlyle Capital debt fund in Amsterdam as well as dozens of US mortgage banks 
means there is a rising systemic risk in the international banking system. This 
suggests gold could well rise to $1,100 an ounce.<br>
<br>
The argument for GCC currency revaluations becomes even more compelling if the 
Fed funds’ rates falls below 1 per cent and the US central bank retains its 
aggressive easy money policy as long as the US economy continues to weaken. 
Never in modern times have the business cycles of the US and the GCC diverged so 
dramatically. Qatar and the UAE, the highest inflation economies in the GCC, 
will be most tempted to emulate the example of Kuwait and abandon their currency 
pegs to the dollar. While cement prices, rent, subsidies, property speculation, 
wages, food prices all contribute to GCC inflation, imported inflation is more a 
problem in smaller, open economies like Qatar and the UAE than in Saudi Arabia. 
With GCC monetary union now postponed, the political cost of a revaluation has 
fallen while a 1 per cent Fed fund rate could make its policy rationale 
irresistible in some GCC capitals. </font></p>

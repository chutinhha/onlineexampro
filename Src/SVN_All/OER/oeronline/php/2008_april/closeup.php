Saudi Arabia’s Growing Unemployment Headache</font></b><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>It is not about creating enough employment opportunities per se, but of 
creating rather the right jobs for Saudi nationals<br>
</b><br>
Authorities in Saudi Arabia need to attend to the jobless problem to ensure that 
it does not spin out of control. The country’s unemployment rate crossed the 11 
per cent line in the first half of 2007, the latest period for which statistics 
are available.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="closeup.jpg" width="132" height="243" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="3">Adding to the urgency of addressing the unemployment problem is the fact that a 
sizeable portion of Saudi nationals happens to be below the working age, or 
close to entering the job market. Some 38 per cent of Saudi nationals are below 
the age of 14 and hence are soon expected to enter the job market.<br>
<br>
The main challenge here relates to ensuring the availability of jobs that meet 
the requirements of Saudi nationals. Undoubtedly, at stake is not creating 
enough employment opportunities per se, but instead it is about creating the 
right jobs for Saudi nationals. The Saudis do not just desire all jobs that 
expatriates may be willing to undertake. For instance, they do not want menial 
jobs that provide relatively low wages, like those in the construction sector. 
Certainly, such attitudes can change in the long run through rehabilitation and 
training. However, Saudi officials do not have the luxury of delaying tackling 
the current unemployment problem that the country faces.<br>
<br>
<b>Increasing joblessness</b><br>
According to the country’s Ministry of Economy and Planning, the unemployment 
rate amongst the national workforce stood at 11.2 per cent in the first half of 
2007. The figure compares unfavourably with a reported jobless rate of 11 per 
cent in the first half of 2006.<br>
The number of Saudi nationals without jobs totalled 453,994 in the first half of 
2007, up by some 8,796 from the corresponding period in 2006. And, this at a 
time when it was expected to drop on the back of extraordinary economic 
conditions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Spending problem</b><br>
In fact, improved economic conditions should have led to a decline in the 
unemployment figures rather than increasing their number. Improved economic 
conditions here refer to the steady rise in crude oil prices. The petroleum 
sector accounts for more than three quarters of budgetary revenue and thus plays 
a primary role in the country’s economic activities.<br>
<br>
Saudi Arabia’s real (adjusted for inflation) gross domestic product (GDP) grew 
by 3.5 per cent in 2007. The kingdom’s economy saw inflation grow at 6.5 per 
cent last year. Here, it must be remembered that inflation tends to be viewed as 
the worst enemy as it affects all, while the same is not necessarily true of 
unemployment.<br>
<br>
<b>Gender factor</b><br>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Economy and Planning suggest worsening 
employment prospects for females in particular. The jobless rate amongst females 
increased from 24.7 per cent in the first half of 2006 to 26.6 per cent in the 
same period in 2007. This was even as the unemployment rate amongst males 
continued to hover around 8 per cent in the same time span.<br>
Some employers in the GCC region, Saudi Arabia being no exception, prefer 
employing males. This is partly due to the concern that females tend to 
experience rising absenteeism as soon as they get married.<br>
<br>
<b>Eighth Plan goals</b><br>
The latest jobless figures make the prospects of achieving manpower goals of the 
8th Development Plan only more difficult. The eight five-year plan envisages 
some 139,000 job seekers by 2009 versus 268,000 Saudi nationals looking for 
employment opportunities in 2004. In fact, the plan expects Saudi unemployment 
rate to drop from 7 per cent in 2004 to 2.8 per cent by 2009.<br>
Likewise, it will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve the plan forecasts 
with regards to contribution of females in the workforce. The plan envisages 
females representing 14.2 per cent of the national workforce by 2009 as compared 
to 10.3 per cent in 2004. As the latest figures suggest, the chances are that 
actual female participation will drop further unless authorities take concrete 
remedial steps.<br>
<br>
<b>For locals only</b><br>
One way of tackling unemployment amongst locals relates to restricting certain 
jobs to Saudi nationals. The country’s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 
restricts around 40 job profiles to locals. These include taxi drivers, training 
and purchasing managers, public relations officers, administrative assistants, 
secretaries, operators, debt collectors, customer service, accountants, tellers, 
postmen, data handlers, librarians, booksellers, ticket kiosk keepers, auto 
salesmen, janitors, internal mail handlers and tour guides, among others. 
Officials contend that Saudi nationals prefer such professions.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, it is clear that the government cannot overlook the employment 
problem amongst locals because of its implications. Yet, the authorities have an 
opportunity to maximise benefits to help address the jobless problem. Suffice to 
say, the budget recorded surplus of US$47 billion in fiscal year 2007. Possibly, 
Saudi officials need to enhance public spending in order to create job 
opportunities. Also, emphasis must be placed on providing nationals with the 
necessary tools in terms of education, training and work ethics, in order to be 
employees of choice in the private sector. </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

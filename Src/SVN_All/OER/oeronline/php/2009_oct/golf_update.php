                    contemplative Robert Karlsson has rewritten a number of golfing 
                    records during his career<br>
                    <br>
                    </b>Born in Katrineholm, Sweden on Sebtember 3, 1969, Robert 
                    Karlsson grew up among golf courses. His father was a green 
                    keeper and it was only a matter of time before he took up 
                    golfing. He turned professional in 1989 and qualified for 
                    membership of the European Tour at the 1990 Qualifying School. 
                    He has since retained his card and has had a steady career 
                    on tour. <br>
                    <br>
                    He has finished in the top twenty of the Order of Merit six 
                    times throughout his career but it wasn’t until 2008 that 
                    he actually won it. This was the highlight of his career.<br>
                    <br>
                    He has finished in the top twenty of the Order of Merit six 
                    times throughout his career and has won nine events on tour. 
                    At the 2006 Celtic Manor Wales Open, Karlsson broke the European 
                    Tour’s 36 hole and 54 hole scoring records by shooting 124 
                    for the first two rounds and 189 for the first three. <br>
                    <br>
                    However as the course was a par 69, which is rare at the top 
                    level, his to-par scores were a much less remarkable 14 under 
                    after two rounds and 18 under after three. Karlsson’s second 
                    victory of 2006 at the Deutsche Bank Players Championship 
                    of Europe in July helped him reach the top 50 of the Official 
                    World Golf Rankings and in 2008 he entered the top 25. His 
                    win at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship took him to No.8 
                    in October 2008. A T3 finish at the Portugal Masters two weeks 
                    later took him to No.6. He spent 13 weeks in the top-10 in 
                    2008.<b><br>

                    was a member of the Continental Europe team in the Seve Trophy 
                    in 2000, 2002 and 2007. In 1999 he was eleventh on the Ryder 
                    Cup qualifying table just missing out on the last automatic 
                    place, and was not selected as a captain’s pick. He made his 
                    Ryder Cup debut in 2006, at the age of 37, along with fellow 
                    Swede Henrik Stenson. He played again in 2008, forming a partnership 
                    with Pádraig Harrington in the foursomes and beating Justin 
                    Leonard 5 and 3 in the singles on Sunday. <br>
                    <br>
                    After a strong finish to the season, Karlsson won the Order 
                    of Merit in 2008, being the first Swedish golfer to do so. 
                    Because the name of the money list changes to the “Race to 
                    Dubai” beginning with the 2009 season, it was the final “Order 
                    of Merit” win. This achievement, among other things, resulted 
                    in him winning Swedish male athlete of the year at the Swedish 
                    Sports Gala in January 2009, also a Swedish male golfer first.<br>
                    <br>
                    Karlsson is one of the tallest golfers on the European Tour 
                    at 6ft 5in. Like many leading Swedish golfers he lives outside 
                    his home country, basing himself in the tax haven of Monaco. 
                    In June 2009, Karlsson had suffered from an eye injury, with 
                    no depth-perception in his left eye. It occurred during the 
                    week of the St. Jude Classic, the week before the US Open, 
                    which Karlsson was set to play in, teeing off in the first 
                    round with Stenson. The eye injury caused Karlsson to withdraw 
                    from the event. Karlsson is known as “The Scientist” for his 
                    analytical and contemplative style of play.<b><br>

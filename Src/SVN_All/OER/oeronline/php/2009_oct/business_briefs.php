				are especially designed to build confidence in young adults aged 
				between 16-18 years. Renaissance is keen to provide such an

				confrontations with the competitive wilderness in a “no phone, 
				no cooks, no doors classroom” as a key to realising their 
				self-potential. Working in groups also builds the appreciation 
				for teamwork and responsible citizenry. The lessons taught on an 
				Outward Bound course through a series of team building, problem 
				solving and physical challenges will translate into strategic 
				life and business skills for the Omani students chosen to 
				attend. Renaissance Services is the first lead partner to pledge

				from government schools, and hopes more Omani corporate will 
				follow suit. Each course accommodates groups of 18 people and

					<br>
                    BAE Systems has joined forces with Quest International UK 
                    of Cheadle, Cheshire to introduce to the world’s airlines 
                    the AirManager, a radical new active air management system, 
                    which sets a new standard for exceptionally clean air on board 
                    aircraft. In addition to introducing AirManager on its own 
                    BAe 146/Avro RJ airliners, BAE Systems has signed an agreement 
                    with Quest to bring the benefits of the breakthrough AirManager 
                    technology to the wider aviation market. Under this agreement 
                    BAE Systems will act as an authorised distributor for worldwide 
                    sales to airlines of the AirManager system for an initial 
                    period of five years. Through its regional aircraft business 
                    BAE Systems has not only engineered and certified the installation 
                    of AirManager on to its own aircraft, but has also designed 
                    and certificated a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), for 
                    installation on the Boeing 757, with a trial unit now being 
                    evaluated. Contracts for future STC designs on other aircraft 
                    types will be determined by Quest International UK in the 
                    light of market demand. BAE Systems is the premier global 
                    defence, security and aerospace company. </font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CC3300">

                    Oman Air took the delivery of its first Airbus A<img border="0" src="images/img7.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="196" height="259">330-200. 
                    The aircraft was handed over to the airline at a ceremony 
                    held in Toulouse on September 15. The ceremony was attended 
                    by HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, minister of national economy 
                    and the chairman of Oman Air and Peter Hill, the airlines 
                    CEO. Configured in a very comfortable two-class layout, the 
                    aircraft provides space for 216 passengers, including 20 business 
                    class seats and 196 economy class seats. H E Macki said, “The 
                    delivery of this Airbus A330 is a milestone in the transformation 
                    of Oman Air. This brand-new A330 is the first of seven Airbus 
                    long-range aircraft to be delivered to Oman Air. All aircrafts 
                    are to be delivered to the national carrier of Oman within 
                    the next two years as part of the airline’s expansion plan 
                    for its international fleet.” <br>
                    <br>
                    The new Economy Class seats will offer adjustable headrests 
                    and footrests, individual 10 inch video screens and will have 
                    a pitch of 34 inches. The Business Class seat will offer a 
                    fully lie-flat bed, electrically controlled backrest and leg 
                    rest, a buddy seat and a 17-inch in-flight entertainment screen. 
                    Ensuring the very best in in-flight entertainment, Oman Air 
                    has selected the Thales i5000 system, which when combined 
                    with the Rockwell Collins Tailwind 560 platform, will provide 
                    live TV to every seat on the aircraft. In addition, every 
                    passenger will have access to e-mail, Internet, and mobile 
                    phone, as well as laptop, connectivity. This, coupled with 
                    the impeccable standard of service for which Oman Air is known, 
                    would make a journey truly memorable.<br>
                    <br>
                    Says Hill, “We are absolutely delighted to be taking delivery 
                    of this superb new aircraft. Not only is the A330 itself at 
                    the leading edge of civil aviation, but the onboard products 
                    that Oman Air is offering to passengers are second to none.”</font><br>

				BankDhofar direct sales unit to increase customer convenience 
				BankDhofar recently enhanced its direct sales team to reach out 
				to customers directly and bridge the gap between them and the 
				bank. The platform will deliver new levels of efficiency and 
				convenience for its customers. Conventional marketing of banking 
				products encompassed popular mediums of mass communication like 
				advertising or merely waiting for a customer to walk into a 
				branch. This at times does not reveal the complete picture of 
				benefits that are available to a potential customer. It is under 
				this premise that the direct sales practice was set up with an 
				objective to bridge the gap between the bank and the customer, 
				convey the right message to the customer directly and to 
				discover the latent needs of a customer.</font></p>

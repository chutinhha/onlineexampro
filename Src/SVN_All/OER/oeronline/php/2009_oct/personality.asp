                    Humayun Kabir, general manager business banking, National 
                    Bank of Oman (NBO) vividly remembers his meeting with Lance 
                    Armstrong, the seven times Tour de France champion at a lecture 
                    series in Toronto, Canada. Says Kabir, “He spoke about believing 
                    in oneself and felt that every human being has so much latent 
                    energy and capability that they can achieve the impossible 
                    if they willed so.” Having proved his mettle on the cycling 
                    tracks, Armstrong is now putting his energies in fighting 
                    against cancer, a disease that he has been battling himself. 
                    Kabir seems to have taken a page or two out of his role model’s 
                    book. In an 18-month stint with NBO he has worn three different 
                    hats – chief financial officer (CFO), general manager retail 
                    banking and his current assignment. Not one to shy away from 
                    challenges, he has taken up each of these roles with equal 
                    gusto.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Looking back</b><br>
                    A chartered accountant from UK, he started his post qualification 
                    career at Ernst&amp;Young and went on to work at Saudi American 
                    Bank (SAMBA) in Saudi Arabia. In 1991 he migrated to Canada 
                    and spent the next 10 years in various institutions like the 
                    Royal Bank of Canada and ABN Amro. Bitten by the entrepreneurial 
                    bug in 2000, Kabir set up Inforica – a technology consulting 
                    firm as its managing partner. He worked at the firm for six 
                    years before the itch to do something different caught up. 
                    “The entrepreneurial run has made me appreciate a larger canvas 
                    as one gets a broader exposure,” he says.<br>
                    <br>
                    As a leader he believes that trust and integrity are paramount 
                    values that one should espouse. This translates into keeping 
                    one’s promises to customers and employees. A strategic vision 
                    and clarity are the other must haves for a good leader. Speaking 
                    about his managerial style he says, “I am a mix of a directive 
                    and participative approach. My natural style is participative, 
                    but there are times when one needs to be assertive. With the 
                    authoritarian style of management having gone out of fashion, 
                    engaging people and enabling them to achieve their potential 
                    is what good managers are all about.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Apart from his experience, these values have helped him to 
                    contribute to NBO in more ways than one. Though the banking 
                    industry has gone through a difficult phase, Kabir is cautiously 
                    optimistic about 2010, “It has been a challenging time and 
                    we spent a lot of time analysing, strategising and making 
                    a few key decisions.” These include better risk management, 
                    a focus on low cost deposits, financial discipline to check 
                    costs and to focus on customers and employees.<br>
                    <br>
                    The measures have helped the bank to come out relatively unscatched 
                    from the crisis. “In the next three-to-four months we will 
                    know whether things will take a V or W shape in future,” he 
                    adds. For someone who thrives on challenges and turnarounds, 
                    the experience of the last few months has been both interesting 
                    and enriching.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The flip side </b><br>
                    Ask him about striking a work-life balance and he confesses 
                    to being completely at sea, “It’s an ongoing battle and one 
                    has to constantly work on it. Though it is difficult, a supportive 
                    wife makes things easier.” At home, he encourages his four 
                    children to read, explore new topics and to debate. Weekends 
                    are usually spent at the Hotel Intercontinental club doing 
                    various activities.<br>
                    <br>
                    The family takes a vacation twice a year, and he plans to 
                    explore Oman in the coming months. Says Kabir, “We have not 
                    seen a lot of Oman as my fam<img border="0" src="images/img35.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5">ily joined me late last year. 
                    There are so many beautiful places here that we need to see.” 
                    Having studied and started his career in London, the city 
                    remains an abiding favourite. The cosmopolitan ethos of London, 
                    its history, parks like Hyde Park and Regents Park and its 
                    restaurants hold a special significance for him. “I have shown 
                    the family my favourite haunts in London so many times that 
                    they are completely bored of it by now,” he says in a self-deprecating 
                    manner.<br>
                    <br>
                    An avid reader, he delves into history, anthropology and business 
                    books. “I buy more than what I can read.” Reminiscing about 
                    treasury operations at the Royal Bank of Canada and ABN Amro, 
                    he says, “It was a unique experience to see how global events 
                    had an impact on the markets almost every moment.” This has 
                    encouraged him to keep abreast of global crosscurrents. He 
                    tunes in to business news on televisions surfing, Bloomberg, 
                    CNBC, CNN and BBC, whenever possible. A paucity of time limits 
                    his ability to watch movies, but he unwinds with his choice 
                    of music – ghazal maestro Mehdi Hasan and Hindi music from 
                    the 1970s and 1980s.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>On the course</b><br>
                    An enthusiastic golfer, he is eagerly awaiting the opening 
                    of the 18-hole golf course at the Muscat Golf and Country 
                    Club. In Canada he used to play golf twice a week for over 
                    five hours a day. He chuckles, “Golf is the third angle of 
                    the work-life balance triangle along with family and work, 
                    giving credence to the term golfing widows.” On a serious 
                    note he points out the reasons which draws corporate captains 
                    to the game. For Type A personalities (go-getters, competitive 
                    and domineering), the game works as a humbling experience 
                    because despite their best efforts they are unable to manage 
                    or control things on the golf course and this keeps attracting 
                    them back to the game. Second, the ups and downs of a game 
                    mirrors the highs and lows of human life. Finally, it is a 
                    social sport that gives one quality time with others.<br>
                    <br>
                    A keen sportsman he has played hockey, cricket, table tennis, 
                    badminton, though lately he has been partial to squash. “Sports 
                    teaches a player how to win and how to lose. It shows that 
                    there are no short cuts in life and one has to work hard to 
                    succeed. Team sports builds camaraderie and social skills. 
                    Overall, it inculcates leadership and determination,” says 
                    Kabir. We are sure Lance Armstrong would agree wholeheartedly.</font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><b><br>

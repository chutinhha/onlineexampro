				Vinita Bali, CEO, Britannia Industries and the 22nd most

				survey talks about the acquisition of Al Sallan Food Industries 
				and her future plans for the company in an exclusive interview 
				with Mayank Singh<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>When Britannia 
				Industries took over Al Sallan Food Industries it had a certain 
				roadmap in mind for the company. Have things worked to plan? </b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                <img src="images/img44.jpg" hspace="9" vspace="5" align="right"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				I think since the takeover a lot of things that we planned for 
				have worked extremely well and the numbers underline this robust 
				performance. The company has grown by 55-60 per cent in Oman. In 
				the Gulf region, its business has grown from $6mn in 2008 to 
				over $7mn in 2009, which translates into an marketshare increase 
				from 13.5 per cent to around 17 per cent. The company has been 
				working on strengthening its go-to-market structure and its back 
				end. When a company like P&amp;G appoints Khimji Ramdas Group (KR) 
				as its distributor, it speaks volumes about the competency and 
				capability of the group. The distribution of all our brands like 
				Nutro, Baker’s Pride and Britannia products are done by KR. 
				Consolidating products under one distribution umbrella is 
				bringing in best practices, better availability, visibility and 
				merchandising. Our brands have been given more character and 
				personality by bringing in enhancements in product recipes, 
				packaging etc. For example, the Nutro brand was recently 
				relaunched in a new package. While there is no magic elixir, 
				it’s all these things put together in a coordinated and 
				orchestrated way that has resulted in a 55 per cent increase in 
				our topline. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Britannia is looking at consolidating operations in the 
				region. How much of this strategy has been executed? </b><br>
				We are consolidating our operations in the entire Middle East. 
				Whatever I have spoken to you about, in terms of consolidating 
				our distributors and how we go to market in Oman has been done 
				in all the GCC countries. We are significant players in India – 
				which is one of the largest biscuit markets in the world, with 
				Al Sallan Food we had the opportunity to buy into two similar 
				businesses in the Middle East and use this as a springboard to 
				access another 35-40 countries around the world. Having a 
				manufacturing base in the region helps us to access markets in 
				the MENA region.<br>
				<br>
				<b>When Britannia took over, there were concerns that it might 
				not continue with Al Sallan’s brands like Baker’s Pride and 
				Nutro. How are you segmenting various brands offered by the 
				company, and do these brands clash with your products like Good 
				Day? </b><br>
				Not really. We have done a lot of consumer work and have found 
				that consumers see a lot of difference between our various 
				brands. We are ultimately going to land up with three big brands 
				– Nutro, Baker’s Pride and Britannia. This market is large 
				enough and has a number of brands in almost every category. 
				Actually it’s not just the positioning. You have to go back to 
				the product. So Good Day is a recipe that is not replicated in 
				any Baker’s Pride or Nutro product. We have launched wafers 
				under the Nutro brand. Baker’s Pride still operates under the 
				shortbread and cookies segment which is again differentiated in 
				terms of the product experience. So the differentiation is not 
				only in the positioning but also in the experience of the 
				product, the price point and the ultimate branding.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Is there a differentiation strategy in terms of the pricing 
				as well, with certain products being entry level brands and 
				others being priced higher? </b><br>
				I think it is kind of myopic to say that here is an entry level 
				price for any of these brands. In re</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ality, how do people buy 
				brands? People buy not just our brands but also brands of other 
				competitors. People don’t say let me buy Britannia products then 
				I’ll buy Nutro and all that. If you look at it from a consumer 
				point of view, the consumer is looking for a certain overall 
				experien</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ce at a price point which represents value for him. So 
				the same consumer at different points of time is buying 
				different brands like a McVities Digestive and a Nutro wafer. So 
				I think our insight, whether here or anywhere else, is that 
				consumers are not linear in the kind of choices they make.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Is there any particular segment of the population that you’re 
				targeting in the region?</b> <br>
				Actually “biscuits” is a category that is very pervasive. I 
				don’t know what the numbers are here, but if you look at a 
				market like India it has a 90 per cent category penetration 
				across urban and rural areas. My guess would be that it’s no 
				different here. It’s almost like saying that every household 
				consumes biscuits. That could be a branded biscuit, a bakery 
				biscuit or something else. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What is the idea behind the mega launch of Nutro with reputed 
				designer Jane T. doing the packaging?</b><br>
				There’s only one simple idea and that is to get a larger number 
				of people to buy more of our brands. So it’s just not a 
				packaging change, but giving our customers more reasons to buy 
				our brands. If we had treated it only as a packaging change we 
				would have been short charging our custome</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><img src="images/img45.jpg" hspace="9" vspace="5" align="left"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">rs. There’s been a lot 
				of work that has gone into understanding our product, the 
				recipes, the way people buy, when they buy, pack sizes and 
				formats. We are, for the first time, making available a small, 
				personal consumption pack with three wafers. So it’s taking this 
				insight and saying that while there is a lot of biscuit 
				consumption at home, there’s a lot of on-the-go consumption as 
				well. It is about getting new usage occasions; it’s about 
				getting new consumers to enjoy our brands – not only at home but 
				also out of home.<br>
				<br>
				<b>This is a strategy that you have implemented in India and it 
				has worked very well; do you think the same premise will work 
				here too? </b><br>
				Well, we are in the market. We have to see. Nothing ventured, 
				nothing gained. We certainly believe it will. If you think about 
				it that’s the kind of behaviour people are exhibiting when they 
				are buying sugar or chocolate confectionery.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How much is Britannia Industries planning to invest in Al 
				Sallan’s restructuring?</b><br>
				I think, the way to think about it is not in terms of 
				restructuring. We think about it in terms of how much we have 
				invested in creating a presence and growth in this market. And 
				if I were to put it that way, our investment in this region has 
				been in excess of a INR100 crores (RO390mn). <br>
				<br>
				<b>How soon are you looking at making a profit in the region?</b><br>
				During our first year of operation, we had a small cash profit. 
				Last year was a tough year for this industry around the world. 
				And certainly this year we are looking at a positive cash profit 
				though the rate of growth is likely to slow down given what is 
				happening in the general economic environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think you are better placed in the GCC than in India, 
				in the context of the adverse economic situation?</b><br>
				I think yes and no, when you say this region, the market’s even 
				within the region have behaved differentially. If you look at a 
				market like Dubai, there has been quite an exodus of people as 
				employment opportunities have come down. Certainly as far as 
				this region is concerned, there is a GDP growth because oil 
				price helps everything. But commodity inflation is hitting the 
				world and it is impacting consumers in this part of the world 
				also. <br>

                    <br>
                    In the last one year post the financial crisis starting with 
                    the collapse of Lehman Brothers, euphoria turned to despair 
                    and then to hope. Asset prices of all classes have been so 
                    volatile that one can loose perspective. One often hears words 
                    like “crash” and “bursting of the bubble” but one must take 
                    a longer term look and see what happened dispassionately. 
                    Was there a real estate bubble in Oman? Ultimately, over the 
                    medium and long term, prices are dictated by supply and demand. 
                    Let us examine these.<br>
                    <br>
                    The government of Oman’s conservative and prudent management 
                    of the economy means that employment has actually been expanding 
                    even after the onset of the crisis. The table gives the total 
                    number of employees in the private sector over a period of 
                    slightly over five years. One can see that employment in the 
                    private sector has more than doubled in the last five and 
                    a half years. In less than a year post financial crisis, the 
                    employment in the private sector is up by about 79,000 or 
                    nearly nine per cent<img border="0" src="images/img26.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="5">. 
                    In the five years between 2003 and 2008, the GDP of the country 
                    at current prices has gone from about RO8.28bn to about RO23.04bn. 
                    Thus the economy in nominal terms has nearly tripled in size 
                    in five years. The demand for property has grown with the 
                    economy and it is no surprise that even after the “crash”, 
                    property prices are two to three times what they were about 
                    five years ago. We tend to have short memories and only see 
                    the decline from peak prices. Yes, of course property prices 
                    reached unprecedented levels for a brief period towards the 
                    middle of 2008, just prior to the onset of the financial crisis 
                    and have since come down but seen over a longer duration, 
                    prices have actually gone up significantly. A lot of people 
                    are puzzled by the fact that rents have not come down in a 
                    big way. The reasons are simple. There is a demand since the 
                    economy has been creating jobs at a fast pace even after the 
                    crisis. The cost of land has gone up significantly in the 
                    last five years and building material prices as per the building 
                    material price index published by the ministry of national 
                    economy have inched up by about 60 per cent in the same period. 
                    Thus the developers can no longer make a return at rents which 
                    prevailed a few years ago.<br>
                    <br>
                    Looking ahead, oil prices are hovering at about $70 per barrel 
                    and the economy can be expected to maintain its present level 
                    of activity if not grow. The non-oil segment of the economy 
                    has been growing largely on account of government spending. 
                    However, oil prices have a knock on effect on the non-oil 
                    segment and thus economic growth in the medium term will depend 
                    on oil prices. The consensus estimate is that oil prices will 
                    be about $100 per barrel once the world economy returns to 
                    a growth path and thus we can expect the Omani economy and 
                    hence the real estate sector to do well in the medium term.<br>

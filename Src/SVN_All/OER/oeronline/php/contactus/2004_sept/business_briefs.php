                    <img border="0" src="im19.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="124" height="124">According to HE Maqbool bin Ali
Sultan, minister of commerce and
industry, Oman’s manufacturing sector
looks promising and is poised to
contribute 15 per cent to the country’s
GDP by 2020. “As against the above
target, the manufacturing sector’s contribution
to the GDP so far has been 5.4
per cent in the year 2000, 8.3 per cent in
the year 2001 and 7.7 per cent in 2002,”
revealed the minister.
<br>
                    <br>
                    The minister pointed put that
Oman is gearing to meet the challenges
in the new century by focusing on nonoil
sectors, and that the private sector
will be the primary engine of growth.
“A diversified, dynamic and globalised
economy is to be established through a
strong, efficient and competitive private
sector,” said HE Sultan.
<br>
                    <br>
&nbsp;To validate his point, the minister
gave the example of the Oman-India
Fertiliser Company (OMIFCO), a joint
venture between Oman Oil Company
(OOC) – which holds a 50 per cent share
in the venture – and its Indian partners,
the Krishak Bharati Cooperative Limited
(Kribhco) with a 25 per cent stake
and the Indian Farmers Fertilisers Cooperative
(IFFCO) with the remaining
25 per cent share. The venture is being
implemented in Sur. Claimed to be the
world’s largest grassroots fertiliser
complex, it will produce 1.6 million
tonnes per year of urea and 250,000
tonnes of surplus ammonia.
<br>
                    <br>
                    Another important project that the
minister pointed out was the $650 million
(RO250 million) Sohar International
Urea and Chemical Industries SAOC.
This fertiliser company is promoted by
Sheikh Suhail bin Salim Bahwan (100
per cent private sector) and will begin
construction work by the end of next
month (September 2004).
<br>
                    <br>
                    The Sohar project, which will produce
1,225,000 tonnes of urea per annum,
is expected to begin commercial production
by Q4 2007, the minister said.
The other projects that the minister talked
about included the Oman Methanol
Holding Company LLC, which is
jointly promoted by the Omzest group,
Methanol Holdings (Trinidad) and
Ferrostaal AG, of Germany and the
$1.3 billion (RO500 million) Sohar Oil
refinery project. Once completed, the
refinery will have a crude unit with a
capacity of 116,000 barrels per day.

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Higher oil prices bode
well for economy: CBO </b><br>
The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) has
pointed put that higher oil prices will help
maintain the overall economic growth
despite the declining trend in oil production,
which may continue in 2004. “The
declining trend in oil production is expected
to continue in 2004. However, its
adverse impacts on gross domestic product
(GDP), exports and revenues will
be more than offset by rising oil prices.
In fact, the domestic economy remained
stable last year despite a fall in oil production,”
said HE Hamood Sangour Al
Zadjali, executive president of the CBO.
According to HE Al Zadjali, fluctuations
in international oil prices and developments
on domestic oil production
will significantly influence the macroeconomic
prospects of Oman for 2004.
“Strong global growth and high oil prices
could, however, entail stronger inflationary
impulses, and the policy responses
of countries to counter this concern could
be manifested in the form of a reversal
in the interest rate cycle,” he added.

<b>OPEC may raise
production ceiling
</b><br>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) may increase its
official production limits to meet actual
output. ‘’There is the possibility because
actual OPEC production is around 30
million bpd and we will discuss it in
September,” said OPEC chief HE Purnomo
Yusgiantoro. OPEC ministers are
scheduled to review production policy
in Vienna on September 15.
<br>
<br>
The organisation’s self-imposed output
limits were raised to 26 million barrels
per day (bpd) from August 1 for the
10 members bound by quotas, excluding
Iraq. But actual output has been
running about 2 million bpd over the
ceiling as OPEC tries to stem a relentless
oil price rally this year.
<br>
<br>
Most OPEC members are pumping
close to maximum and only Saudi Arabia
has any significant spare capacity.
OPEC had 1 million to 1.5 million bpd
of spare production capacity that could
be brought on-stream if needed, added
HE Yusgiantoro.<br>
<br>
Iraq, which is struggling to rebuild
its oil industry after the 2003 war and a
series of sabotage attacks this year on its
oil infrastructure, expects exports to
average 1.8 million bpd this month. An
Iraqi oil industry source said that exports
from the southern Basra oil terminal
were currently running at a rate of 2
million bpd.

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Government revenue
up by 14.8% in H1
</b><br>
The revenues of the Omani government
rose by 14.8 per cent during the first six
month of the year 2004 to RO1,896.4 million
compared to RO1,651.3 million during
the same period in 2003. The Ministry
of National Economy has attributed this
rise to a 9.1 per cent surge in net oil revenues
which stood at RO1,353.4 million
as at the end of June this year compared
to RO1,240.2 million during the same
period in 2003, and a rise in revenues
from liquefied gas and oil condensates
which amounted to RO186.1 million.
<br>
<br>
Natural gas revenues were also up
by 22 per cent during the first six months
of 2004 to RO30.5 million, compared to
RO25 million in the corresponding period
last year. Customs duties revenues
rose by 15.2 per cent to RO28.7 million,
as against RO24.9 million as at the end
of June 2003.
<br>
<br>
Capital revenues declined by 12.8 per
cent to RO4.1 million at the end of June
2004, compared to RO4.7 million in 2003.
Corporate income tax revenues fell by 4
per cent to RO45.5 million, compared to
RO47.4 million at the end of June 2003.
Other revenues dropped by 19.7 per
cent to RO248.1 million, as against
RO309.1 million at the end of June 2003.
<br>
<br>
Government public expenditure rose
by 22.9 per cent during the first six
months of 2004 to RO1,708.4 million,
compared to RO1,390.2 million a year
ago. The rise in the public expenditure
resulted from a 18.2 per cent increase in
current spending which stood at
RO1,259 million, as against RO1,065.5
million at June end last year; and a 39.9
per cent rise in investment expenses
which stood at RO436.3 million, compared
to RO311.9 million a year ago.
<br>
<br>
Support for the private sector rose
by 2.3 per cent to RO13.1 million, compared
to RO12.8 million in H1 2003. The
state general budget saw a surplus of
RO188 million at the end of June 2004,
compared to a surplus of RO261.1 million
during the same period in 2003.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Banks’ bad loans fall
<br>
</b>The net non-performing loans (uncovered)
of banks as a percentage to net
loans declined from 4.8 per cent in 2002
to 3.1 per cent in 2003, said HE Hamood
Sangour Al Zadjali, executive president
of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO).<br>
<br>
“The level of loan-loss provisions
and reserved interest surged ahead by
30.6 per cent in 2003. This is a significant
improvement, as the loan-loss coverage
has gone up from 69.8 per cent in December
2002 to 82.7 per cent in December
2003,” said HE Al Zadjali.
<br>
<br>
An improvement in loan-loss coverage
and arrest of further growth in bad
loans in most cases are positive indicators
about a turnaround in the banking
system. With the adoption of IFRS, banks
are now determining loan impairment
strictly on the basis of such standards.
Thus, banks are required to cushion in
specific loan-loss provisions, on a lineby-
line basis, for loan impairments.

                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>PDO strikes oil at
Malaan<br>
                    </b>Petroleum Development Oman (PDO)
has struck oil in the Shuaiba Formation,
which lies in northwest Oman, in the
Malaan area. The Shuaiba Formation contains
the reservoirs of the Yibal field. The
Malaan location was first targeted in the
year 2000 as a potential place for oil reserves.
Malaan-1, the first well drilled there,
could not produce oil at economic flow
rates. However, by studying the seismic
data and with the use of new technology,
oil reserves have been discovered
along the edge of the Malaan structure.
<br>
                    <br>
                    In February 2004, the Malaan-2 well
began to deliver 1,800 barrels per day.
In June, Malaan-3 was successfully
completed and tested, producing 2,600
barrels per day. ‘’The analysis of the

seismic and well data led to a revised
interpretation of the geological setting,
indicating a stratigraphic trap,” said Stephen
Hiebert, senior interpreter at PDO.
<br>
                    <br>
                    A new drilling technology, called
Schlumberger’s new Logging While
Drilling (LWD), was used in the process.
“PDO and Schlumberger created value
for Oman by combining this new technology
and teamwork,” said Mohsin Al
Hadhrami of Schlumberger. “Without the
use of the LWD tool, the successful production
of Malaan-2 would not have been
realised. The tool enabled us to steer the
drill bit so that it was on average 1.8
metres below the top of the reservoir for
a distance of 700 metres. This represents
for us a step-change in ‘geosteering’
horizontal wells through relatively thin
reservoirs. PDO now has good reason to
review other dormant prospects in
northern Oman that have a similar seismic
image as Malaan. We haven’t finished
with the Shuaiba yet,” he added.

					Haitham M J Al Lawati just turned 30 last month but despite 
					his young age he has achieved success that take most people 
					many more years to achieve. OER chats him up to just to see 
					how he has accomplished such a feat</b><br>

					Al Lawati graduated from Al Yarmouk University, Jordan, in 
					2001, which was ranked amongst the top three universities in 
					the Middle East in the late 1990s, where he did his BCom in 
					Finance and Banking. After a couple of interviews he managed 
					to get his first trainee job in a bank in Bahrain. After a 
					short stint in Bahrain he went and joined Barclays Capital 
					in Dubai and then London in 2002. A year later, in 2003, he 
					joined HSBC Bank plc and stayed there until 2007.<br>
					<br>
					He joined Al Qandeel group of companies in late 2007, his 
					first job ever in Oman. His position in the company at the 
					time was as an Assistant Managing Director and his job was 
					to restructure the current company and also create a group 
					of new sub-companies. The Al Qandeel Group of companies 
					include A Q Construction, Tamayez Architecture &amp; Interiors, 
					Al-Teel Al Wataniyah, Bareeq Al Shatti Mall and Al Qandeel 
					Travel &amp; Tourism.<br>
					<br>
					“Being back in Oman and taking up my first job in a 
					different field and product category was a challenge for 
					me,” claimed Haitham and adds “But a challenge usually makes 
					you stronger in such a way that it broadens your views on 
					different scenarios.” Since he joined Al Qandeel, he has 
					successfully achieved his restructuring goal and in a matter 
					of just two years has earned the designation of Group CEO of 
					the company. <br>
					<br>
					When he first joined the business he used to work close to 
					14 hours a day, “This was not as bad as it seems when you 
					consider that I used to do those same hours in the UK. Also, 
					when I started work here, in 2007, I was still single and 
					didn’t have many commitments.” He has since married and is 
					blessed with a daughter, on November 9 this year, just one 
					day ahead of his own birthday. “So now I am a happy father 
					and since we are no longer two anymore, but three, it means 
					more time spent at home with my family and more dedication 
					to my job because it is my bread and butter.”<br>
					<br>
					<b>Love for travel, sports and rocks</b><br>
					Haitham shares a love for travelling and venturing out to 
					new countries. Among his favourite destinations are 
					Switzerland and London, primarily because he has spent a 
					large portion of his life there. Also, like most Omanis he 
					shares a passion for football. Table tennis and cricket are 
					also among his list of favourite sports and at the age of 14 
					he was a part of Oman’s national table tennis team. One of 
					his greatest and most unique passions is the marble and 
					stones company that he is in-charge off. “Stones are not 
					only a hobby to me now, they are major part of our group of 
					companies’ daily business, they are a true passion for me. I 
					had a love for stones even before I joined Al Qandeel.” He 
					is a person willing to go anywhere around the world to see 
					quarries. He has been all over, from China to Jaipur, Italy 
					and Spain visiting quarries. If things look favourable he 
					will even be visiting Latin America next year all in the 
					love of stones.&nbsp; <br>

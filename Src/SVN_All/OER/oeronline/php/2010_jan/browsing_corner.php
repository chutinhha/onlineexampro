                    <img src="images/bookreview_img1_jan2010.jpg" width="250" height="407" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">When 
					I picked up the book ‘The Economic Naturalist’ my immediate 
					reaction was ‘it is going to be fun reading this as it seems 
					to be amusing unlike most of the other economic books which 
					tend to be too serious and tedious’. It was indeed an 
					interesting experience to read through and it also taught me 
					the best way to learn and teach complex economic principles 
					and theories in a simpler and comprehensible ways. <br>
					<br>
					Going down the memory lane, it reminded me of how I used to 
					struggle many times to understand intricate economic 
					conjectures while studying business management in the 
					university. I used to think probably I didn’t have the 
					requisite intellect to grasp everything thrown at me by my 
					economics teachers. But now I realise that had my esteemed 
					professors been like Robert H Frank, I would have earned 
					better grades and perhaps my understanding of the economics 
					would have been much better. Frank, an economics professor 
					at Cornell University and regular columnist with The New 
					York Times, believes that economics doesn’t just happen in 
					classrooms or international banks. ‘It is everywhere and 
					influences everything we do and see, from the cinema screen 
					to the streets. It can even explain some of life’s most 
					intriguing enigmas.’ He says the information that’s wrapped 
					up in a story just slides into the brain like a key into a 
					lock. ‘You can get information into the brain through other 
					ways also. But as hunter-gatherers, we didn’t immediately 
					rush for twig and start sketching equations and graphs on 
					the sand. When we had some idea to convey, we told a story. 
					And if you can wrap an economic principle up in a story, it 
					just stays with you a lot more easily. You don’t have to 
					really wrestle to get the idea. You’ll go to talk about it 
					with friends. You’ll get better at it. It’s just a much less 
					painful and more effective way to learn about a subject.’<br>
					<br>
					That’s what he has tried to successfully explain in his book 
					with the help of interesting examples through number of 
					real-world questions that are answered with the application 
					of the economic principles in a reader-friendly manner. Why 
					is milk sold in rectangular containers, while soft drinks 
					are sold in round ones? Why do women’s clothes always button 
					from the left, while men’s clothes always button from the 
					right? Thought provoking questions you never thought of 
					before. Robert answers with the help of economic principles 
					behind them. With a lucid copy, he never loses the attention 
					of the reader. Instead, he leaves the reader gasping for 
					more.<br>

				clear to GCC officials and international observers that the 
				collateral damage from conflicts cannot be easily contained 
				within Yemen’s borders</b><br>
                    <br>
                    The region in which Oman lies has never been the most 
				tranquil on the planet and tension is rising on the back of a 
				renewed, multi-faceted conflict in Yemen which is currently 
				engaged in several fronts of domestic conflict – with a 
				separatist movement in the south, Al Houthi rebels in the north 
				and a growing presence of Al Qaeda. Members of the neighbouring 
				GCC are taking a sober look at how the fate of the south western 
				peninsula state is intertwined with their own. Oman is 
				particularly vulnerable to any shocks emanating from Yemen since 
				it shares a border and it is in the Sultanate’s self-interest to 
				help stabilise the troubled country by whatever means available. 
				While the current strife can only be fully solved internally, 
				the long-term ameliorating effect of greater economic ties 
				between Oman – and the wider GCC – and Yemen should not be 
				forgotten. <br>
				<br>
				Yemen is no stranger to domestic conflict. The government has 
				been battling the Shiite Al Houthi rebels intermittently since 
				2004 and separatist sentiment has long been a threat to the 
				country’s fragile unity. Meanwhile crackling in the background 
				is the growing presence of Al Qaeda, which poses a heightened 
				threat of terrorist attacks in GCC territory, particularly the 
				one bordering Oman and Saudi Arabia.<br>
				<br>
				Despite the regular pangs of national strife, Yemen has rarely 
				seen such a confluence of diverse turmoil. President Ali 
				Abdullah Saleh’s grasp of national unity is tenuous at best and 
				two fronts of fighting – combined with chronic weaknesses of the 
				economy, amplified by this year’s global financial crisis – 
				threatens to plunge Yemen into deeper chaos. Indeed while the 
				country remains only marginally integrated with the rest of the 
				Gulf – its application to join the GCC lingers dormant – this 
				oft-forgot corner of the Peninsula is still part and parcel of 
				regional stability. In a salient reminder of this, Al Houthi 
				rebels crossed the border into southern Saudi Arabia at the 
				beginning of November, killing a Saudi border guard and 
				prompting a military reaction.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Neighbouring support</b><br>
				GCC officials have already expressed their solidarity with 
				Sana’a. Following a meeting in late October in Muscat, GCC 
				Interior Ministers vowed – and later reaffirmed their commitment 
				in Doha on November 10 – to support the security, stability and 
				unity of Yemen without interfering in the country’s internal 
				affairs. However, officials have yet to declare a collective 
				response or long-term strategy on the issue. Yemen certainly 
				needs to set its own house in order before any efforts by the 
				GCC can make an appreciable impact. But the GCC – and Oman in 
				particular, thanks to its location away from the most intense 
				conflict zones – can extend economic ties to help lend a more 
				even keel to its neighbour over the long-term.<br>
				<br>
				Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the world. IMF 
				estimates show that the GDP per capita of Yemen broke the one 
				thousand dollar mark just last year, coming in at around $1200 
				(at current prices). By comparison, the GCC average was about 
				$43,000 in 2008, according to IMF data. This huge prosperity gap 
				has been one of the foremost barriers against greater 
				integration between Yemen and the rest of the Gulf, and also a 
				contributing cause to socio-political instability. The 
				government views Al Houthi rebels as religious extremists but 
				the rebels counter they are reacting to economic discrimination 
				by the state. Since the start of the government’s offensive 
				against rebels in the north in August, geopolitical analysts 
				have often framed the situation not as sectarian conflict, but a 
				symptom of the greater failure of the Yemeni state to provide 
				basic services and the rule of law. <br>
				<br>
				But in recent months and years Yemen has made slow but 
				significant steps toward economic progress. Most notably, the 
				country became an exporter of natural gas in early November with 
				its first shipment, destined for South Korea, from the newly 
				built LNG plant on the Gulf of Aden. Future supply routes are 
				planned for Europe and North America, according to media 
				reports. At a cost of $4.5bn, the Balhaf plant is the country’s 
				largest ever investment and, upon completion of the second 
				liquefying unit, will be able to export 6.7m tonnes of gas per 
				year. The World Bank – which recently raised its aid to Yemen 
				from $120mn to $200mn – has estimated that the new project will 
				help the country’s hydrocarbon sector to grow by 45 per cent in 
				2009. <br>
				<br>
				Meanwhile regulatory changes over the past year have helped to 
				improve the business environment. A one-stop shop investment 
				scheme was created, new Customs protocol expedites trade and 
				credit regulations were changed to improve accessibility and <br>
				borrower rights.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Positive report</b><br>
				It was listed as the world’s fastest reformer in the World 
				Bank’s Doing Business 2007/08 report. More recently, Yemen 
				scored marks for positive reforms in three categories in the 
				2010 report: starting a business, getting credit and trading 
				across borders. It ranked number 8 (out of 20) in the Arab world 
				and 99th worldwide on the overall ease of doing business index. 
				As of October 2009, the IMF was predicting a GDP growth rate of 
				4.2 per cent for this year and 7.3 per cent in 2010. Between 
				2000 and 2007, Yemen’s GDP (in current prices) grew at a 
				compound annual growth rate of about 12 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				Greater integration with the economies of the GCC could prove to 
				be the most effective stalwart against Yemen’s backsliding and 
				insure against the consequences, which would be absorbed 
				throughout the region, of Yemen’s failure. Perhaps the most 
				obvious way to integrate Yemen on a large-scale is via the GCC 
				rail network, currently under construction. Indeed GCC 
				authorities have already indicated to the media that they are 
				willing – in principle – to extend the planned railway to Yemen. 
				But progress on the issue seems to have stalled.<br>
				<br>
				For its part, Yemen is already preparing for the possibility of 
				inclusion in the network. Tenders for consultancy work related 
				to a domestic railway are due next month. Meanwhile the UN 
				Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is 
				currently undertaking feasibility studies for three rail 
				projects, one of which is an international line that runs along 
				the borders of Saudi Arabia and Oman.<br>
				<br>
				If executed, the plan would likely open up greater trade within 
				the region, bringing significant economic gains to Yemen. 
				According to the latest statistics available from Yemen’s 
				Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), from 2007, trade with 
				the GCC is weak, with only 12 per cent of total exports headed 
				to the region.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Sultanate’s solidarity</b><br>
				Oman’s efforts to build economic ties with its southern 
				neighbour have been among the region’s most engaging. From late 
				September into October, Yemeni ministers and businessmen joined 
				their counterparts in Muscat to strengthen trade ties. Omani 
				officials reciprocated with a subsequent visit to Sana’a. While 
				no significant or specific accords arose, it was no less an 
				important act of trade diplomacy at a critical time.<br>
				<br>
				A recent report from Saba Centre for Strategic Studies suggests 
				that Yemen has a long way to go before it will integrate into 
				the economy of the wider Gulf, mainly because of the huge gap in 
				GDP and individual wealth. Nevertheless, the potential for 
				integration remains and greater regional cooperation could be 
				achieved by capitalising on Yemen’s strengths, such as its 
				strategic location on the Gulf of Aden and its swiftly expanding 
				population.<br>
				<br>
				It is a widely accepted tenet of development thought and 
				political science that, greater prosperity translates to 
				increased political and social stability. Such a hypothetical 
				transition in Yemen would, obviously, not only aid the whole 
				country, but is also in the self-interest of Oman, Saudi Arabia 
				and the rest of the GCC. As the region emerges from the global 
				financial crisis in a position of relative strength, it has the 
				opportunity to engage Yemen in mutually beneficial economic 
				exchange. While significant risks remain, the long-term cost may 
				be too high to ignore. <br>

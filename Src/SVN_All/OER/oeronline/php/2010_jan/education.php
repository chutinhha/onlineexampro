				<img src="images/education_img1_jan2010.jpg" width="200" height="291" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">What 
				is the big idea behind starting the Gulf School of Business (GSB) 
				in Oman?</b><br>
				I am convinced that management education should be for managers. 
				The question arises that if medical and law education can be 
				given to students, who have no exposure, why is there this 
				debate whether we should have students who have no previous 
				experience or should we have students who have previous 
				experience and that too as managers. The field of management is 
				very young. Management was never thought about as an 
				intellectual discipline. For centuries people have been doing 
				business without going through a management education.<br>
				<br>
				In 1954 Peter Drucker wrote a book called The Practice of 
				Management, that can be seen as a starting point for 
				intellectualising management. He said that if you wanted to know 
				about management you need to know about costing, finance, 
				marketing, human behaviour etc. There is a difference between 
				selling things to a consumer and an organisation. Management is 
				not one subject or a discipline, it is a synthesis of several 
				disciplines. It takes various parts and makes it into one. It 
				calls for an ability to understand the various facets of life. 
				People who believe that they need to understand business are the 
				people who need to study management.<br>
				<br>
				There is a risk that people who have no knowledge of business 
				may go into a company and develop confidence without facing or 
				understanding the problems of managing. Hence we take a position 
				that it is not good to take people who do not have experience in 
				business. We want to bring in people and fill them with the 
				intellectual inputs and practical aspects of management. Second, 
				leadership is about humility, one does not need to bend 
				backwards, it is also about realising that a single person 
				cannot handle everything and the fact that when I team up with 
				other people, it helps me do things better. Third, management 
				education cannot be a canned stuff, it has to be contextual. 
				Oman, Germany or France will have a context and the education 
				has to be in reference to that social, economic or environmental 
				context. Fourth, you cannot say that we will produce everything 
				in Oman and be self-sufficient, that is absurd. If every country 
				does things what they are good at, then things would be 
				efficient; localisation and globalisation are equally important. 
				So when you put all these things together it is GSB. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Does GSB have an affiliation with a foreign institute or is 
				it a stand-alone entity?</b><br>
				The course is for practicing managers. We did not affiliate 
				ourselves with any other institute as most such institutions are 
				franchising like a KFC or a McDonalds and this may not be 
				relevant to the local context. Second, when you are affiliated 
				to an institution, inevitably the affiliated institution will 
				say that this needs to be done in this way and that it is a 
				canned stuff. We did not want this. We are getting people from 
				all over the world to teach at GSB so this way we get a global 
				faculty.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What kind of courses will GSB be offering to its students and 
				what is the USP of the programme?</b><br>
				Our tagline is – Practicing management… differently. We have 
				three programmes, the first is Programme in Practicing 
				Management, the second is Post Graduate Programme in Practicing 
				Management and the third is Masters in Practicing management. 
				The third one is not on offer right now. It is a 15 month 
				programme and only for post graduates. The first programme is 
				also open to people who do not have an undergraduate degree. We 
				realised that in this country, because of its history there are 
				people in managerial positions who do not have an undergraduate 
				degree. So we said we will start with them. There are a lot of 
				concepts and tested hypothesis in management, but our aim is not 
				to dump all of this onto students in a session. We will make it 
				interactive, let management arise in the classroom.<br>
				<br>
				In France, they have a similar 15- month programme in management 
				and a 12-month full time programme in management, but they do 
				not call it practising management. Here a person in the first 
				programme can take a challenge exam and upgrade to the second 
				course and do a full time programme. An orientation programme 
				prepares them to get into an academic mould. The programme 
				involves one week’s face-to-face interaction (classes) for the 
				first six months. So between two sessions there is a four week 
				gap. Thus, there will be six weeks of academic inputs on 10 
				different modules or subjects. While they are in the third week 
				we ask the participant, whether there is some challenge being 
				faced by your company or a professional problem being faced by 
				the manager.<br>
				<br>
				We then tell them to work on that particular issue. So 
				practicing management will bring forth a challenge faced by the 
				company, by the end of the third week. A professor from GSB will 
				be the mentor for students. Starting from then they will work on 
				the project for the next six months. They will be using whatever 
				academic input has been given to them in the sessions in doing 
				that project. In the seventh week meeting they will give a 
				presentation defining the problem and they will share the 
				methodology used, the material gathered, the analysis and the 
				conclusions that they reached.<br>
				<br>
				We also tell them to get their mentor from their company. In 
				addition, we get three judges who will be sitting through this 
				presentation for that one week. This is a very powerful brain 
				trust because when you say that we did something in our company 
				like this, someone may raise their hand and say why did you not 
				think of doing it like this! So people throw ideas at you and it 
				is a real problem for you. Ultimately, you want to solve the 
				problem in the best way and that happens in the session, during 
				the presentation and this project is evaluated. We also give 
				them a comprehensive case study on various subjects that they 
				have learnt. And the case study is another component of 
				evaluation. After the first week there is a four-week gap; in 
				that four week gap, we ask them to do work, for example, at the 
				end of the first week we will throw a topic like – Take care of 
				quality, productivity and customers needs. It is a threaded 
				discussion in which participants need to log in and write what 
				they feel about the topic. This can be a very rich learning 
				process. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What are your plans for GSB in future? </b><br>
				GSB is a joint venture between Morison Muscat Knowledge Centre 
				and NTI, eventually this will be an independent entity, which 
				will be self sustaining. Once we do well in Oman, we plan to set 
				up campuses elsewhere. We want to be the pride of the Gulf.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tell us something about your professional background and what 
				made you choose Muscat as a base for such an endeavour?</b><br>
				I was a professor at Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore 
				for 18 years. I was also at XLRI, Jamshedpur for two years and a 
				consultant for 16 years in banking, mining and manufacturing 
				companies. At IIM-B I was the head of executive education and 
				the head of the centre for entrepreneurial learning and a member 
				of the governing board. In 2005 I came to Oman for the first 
				time to do a programme on corporate governance. I saw a huge 
				opportunity to make a difference to the people in education 
				here. Oman has something that is very inviting and so I am here. <br>

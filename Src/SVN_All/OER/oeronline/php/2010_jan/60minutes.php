                you took over as the CEO of the company, you embarked on a complete 
                makeover of brand Amouage. How much progress have you made in 
                that direction?</b><br>
                Every product in the collection has been rebottled, repackaged 
                and rebranded. The new image has completely been established. 
                In addition, we have launched some new fragrances like Jubilation, 
                Lyric and Epic. We have increased our product category groupings, 
                so now we have a full body and bath collection and an extensive 
                home selection which takes the form of fragrance candles to room 
                sprays. We have phased out some of our old fragrances but we have 
                retained Gold, one of our best sellers and which is kind of our 
                Chanel No 5. Amouage has also retained Deer and Reflection. In 
                the men’s range we have kept Silver Cologne and for customers 
                who like wearing lighter fragrances, we have kept Ciel for men 
                and women. As we were going ahead on this journey we heard about 
                fragrances like Ubar from the past that had been discontinued, 
                but since there was a demand from customers, we relaunched them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Amouage has forayed into various brand extensions. What 
                are the reason for doing so and how have these been faring?</strong> 
                <br>
                The bath and home products are extremely successful. They are 
                getting greater acceptance in the Gulf markets as this is a new 
                concept in the market. We recently launched our range of leather 
                goods. All our leather goods are stamped with our Jackard designs. 
                These are cut and created in Florence in Italy. Florence incidentally 
                is the place where Gucci and Prada began. We import all our leather 
                goods from them tailored to our designs. We take the top cut of 
                a hide, which is the best quality. For a perfume house to launch 
                a leather collection is quite strange, but perfume is a form of 
                accessory and so adding other accessories fits in with the overall 
                positioning of the brand. In a way we are also testing our consumers 
                and our markets, as to whether they will accept us as a leather 
                goods producer. The initial reactions have been better than I 
                thought. This has given me the confidence to have further extensions 
                to the line for the spring-summer next year.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>When was the leather goods collection launched and what 
                does the line include ?</strong><br>
                We launched around three months back and the collection includes 
                small leather goods such as wallets, purses, key case holders, 
                business card holders, photo frames, cosmetic bags for ladies 
                and men’s toiletries bags. We are extending the brand in product 
                categories where it can grow organically step-by-step. It would 
                be wrong for us to create a clothing collection because it would 
                not be accepted. I am not saying that two or three years down 
                we would not come up with a beautiful ladies scarves collection 
                or silk ties or men’s cuff links. Brands have a stretchability 
                factor and we need to see as to how far a brand can be stretched. 
                Since we now have so many of our own retail shops and shop-in-shops, 
                we can now test them out inhouse.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>You are positioned as the king of perfumes. Can that brand 
                promise be extended to the leather goods line where you compete 
                with the likes of Louis Vuitton or Gucci?</strong><br>
                We are nowhere near competing with Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. 
                We aspire to be like them and to give us inspiration for future 
                development. These brands have been around from the turn of the 
                last century and Vuitton has been around since the 19th century. 
                Things do not happen overnight. Despite having a century old heritage, 
                Louis Vuitton only started doing a clothesline in the last ten 
                years. Our objective is to aim high and to sit on the same table 
                as them, but not immediately. We are starting from a zero base; 
                before we repositioned Amouage, it had very little consumer recognition 
                outside the Gulf. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>How much investment has gone into your foray into leather 
                goods and how long will it take Amouage to start making a return 
                on investment?</strong><br>
                Our main investments have been on knives as leather requires steel 
                knives, raw materials and the leather. When one enters a new category 
                or product, one needs to have a longer time frame. Since big brands 
                like Prada, Gucci etc are not available in Oman and if someone 
                wants to gift a good leather product and does not have the time 
                to nip up to Dubai, then we are the natural port of call. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Will such brand extensions eat into your profitability 
                in the short term? </strong><br>
                From the beginning we negotiated bare minimum rates with our manufacturers, 
                so the leather goods collection was profitable from the day we 
                started selling it, thus it has not eaten into our profits. I 
                would not develop something that would take huge profits out of 
                the business. I am proud to say that all these developments, including 
                building a new factory, the planned new shop in Dubai Mall have 
                all been done in-house without us having to seek further capital 
                funding. So we are making our money work for ourselves and not 
                just sitting and counting it as in the past.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>How much are you investing in your new factory and when 
                will it be up and running?</strong><br>
                We are investing 2mn rials. It should be up and running in a year’s 
                time. The new factory will enable us to reach our full forecast 
                capacity till 2020. We currently produce 4500 bottles a month. 
                The new factory will enable us to produce 20,000 bottles a month. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>How have you strengthened your marketing and retailing 
                presence in the GCC and beyond?</strong><br>
                Our presence in the GCC was very shaky when I took over and the 
                brand had begun to decline due to poor brand management and lack 
                of investments. So we had to arrest that decline and protect our 
                markets. We had to convince retailers and distributors to work 
                with us while we went through the transition process. They also 
                needed to believe that we would come out with a very saleable 
                and desirable product at the other side of it. We are moving with 
                our distributors in all the locations that we are placed. Paris 
                Gallery in Dubai and Abu Dhabi; Modern Home in Qatar; Bedouin 
                in Kuwait; and Al Felaij in Bahrain. We have either shops or shop-in-shops 
                so we have an Amouage identified retail presence. In places where 
                there is less space to build shop-in-shops there we have built 
                moor bays. <br>
                <br>
                So we have personalised our space in the region and we have one 
                more year of work to do in the smaller spaces. Having a dedicated 
                space helps us to tie in the retailer to buy our products to fill 
                up the space and gives us a chance to put an Amouage expert to 
                <br>
                sell the product.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>What are your plans for 2010?</strong><br>
                In 2010 we will be looking for a store in London to launch a fragrance 
                and increase our leather goods line. We are working on an exclusive 
                range called the Library collection and those will be marked as 
                Opus 1, Opus 2 and Opus 3 and not given names. These are very 
                unusual and complex fragrances. These will be limited and will 
                appeal to a highly sophisticated audience in the way Chanel’s 
                limited edition or Tom Ford’s special blend does. The edition 
                will be available only in the highest prestige outlet or in our 
                stores. It will be 30 per cent above our current range. Our current 
                range costs 60 rials for a 50ml fragrance and for a 100ml it goes 
                upto 135 rials. The Library collection will be priced 30 per cent 
                higher but for a 120-ml bottle. <br>

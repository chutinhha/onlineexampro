				<font face="Verdana" size="1">David Bloom, Global Head of FX 
				Research, HSBC, was in Oman to deliver his annual address on 
				currency movements and the outlook on the world economy in 2010, 
				recently. Mayank Singh catches up with him on the sidelines of 
				the event</font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br><br></font>

				<img border="0" src="images/banking_img1_jan2010.jpg" width="300" height="394" align="left" hspace="9" vspace="5">What 
				is the main thesis of your address on world economy? </b><br>
				The main thesis of what I am saying is that US interest rates at 
				quarter points pose a challenge to many parts of the world. Once 
				the carry trade comes over, then currencies like the Swiss franc 
				and the Japanese yen will become popular with traders as the 
				risk is low with fundamentally strong currencies with low 
				interest rates. What we now have in the US and UK are low 
				interest rates, but the risks are high in these markets. That 
				makes the carry trade more alert. Also, the US and UK have 
				double digit budget deficits; their debt-to-GDP ratios are high 
				and moving to 100 per cent; they have net external liabilities 
				and they are printing their own money. You cannot get a better 
				combination to borrow the money of a country under such dire 
				circumstances.<br>
				<br>
				Now let us look elsewhere but the question is where is this 
				elsewhere? You have Brazil that pays you around eight per cent 
				interest; in some pegged exchange rates, they have much higher 
				interest rates than these. We heard the Lebanese Central Bank 
				Governor saying last year that they got $15bn in remittances. 
				This is because they offer five per cent interest and have a 
				fixed exchange rate. The interesting thing is that the dollar as 
				a major anchor of stability is breaking down. People pegged into 
				the dollar because in a rocky sea, you could lock your policies 
				into the US which was traditionally a consumer of last resort 
				and a global price setter of commodities. So it gave you an 
				anchor of stability. The US is no longer any of these. <br>
				<br>
				If people are looking at emerging markets with dynamic 
				populations and not ageing populations as in the West, you draw 
				a possibility of a high risk with a high return, that is the 
				emerging world compared to high risk and guaranteed low returns 
				given by the Anglo Saxon model. So people want to catch the 
				crest of the emerging markets world in terms of population and 
				growth, which add up to one thing in a resource-hungry world. So 
				there is a move towards commodity currencies and resources. 
				People want simple products and not complicated products that 
				have caused so much misery and the thing is that you can borrow 
				money at quarter per cent to put into these countries. My main 
				concern is how pegged exchange rates will function six to nine 
				months down the road. <br>
				<br>
				Take the Gulf economies for example, at the moment, it totally 
				suits the region that we have come from global crisis and zero 
				rates. But imagine a scenario if oil prices remain at $100 per 
				barrel and US rates remain at quarter per cent and the dollar 
				keeps falling for the next nine months, then the Gulf economies 
				will be in a recovery phase. In a normal recovery, you would 
				expect rise in asset prices and a slight tightening of policies, 
				but instead the region will be receiving a loosening of policy. 
				This creates a dissonance or as they say a stone in the shoe. 
				And how do you go forward in such a scenario – this is a 
				challenge facing not just the Gulf region, but also South 
				America and Asia. People have linked in to the US as an anchor 
				and some of them are way ahead in the economic cycle and they 
				have to answer the question. We have historically understood as 
				to why we pegged into the US dollar, but the question is – Is it 
				appropriate today? I am not surprised that talk of a single 
				currency is on everyone’s lips and that is something that 
				requires careful consideration. So what I am saying is that the 
				world has moved on but policies have not and this is creating a 
				contradiction and anomaly. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Can we expect interest rates in the US to go up in 2010?</b><br>
				The focus has shifted now. In the old days people were talking 
				about the euro dollar cable, dollar yen. I no longer talk about 
				the yen. I am not interested in the yen anymore. I am only 
				interested in the lessons that yen has to teach us about Japan, 
				which is if you tighten policies too soon, you will be in dire 
				straits. In 1997, the consumption tax in Japan killed the 
				economy, they tightened rates from a quarter to half a per cent 
				and had to cut them again. So this whole idea that the US will 
				raise rates is fanciful and I do not think that we will get a 
				rate rise in the next 12 months. You have to understand that 
				unemployment in the US is at 10.2 per cent and rising. So we 
				have zero rates in the US for the next 12 months. You have to 
				understand that there were independent central banks. This means 
				that fiscal and monetary policy were in a sense divorced from 
				each other, but now there needs to be a reunion of fiscal and 
				monetary policy. Because if we have economies doing well, then 
				we need tighter fiscal policy not tighter monetary policy 
				because tighter fiscal policy does the job of a tighter monetary 
				policy plus it repairs the balance sheets of governments. If 
				that happens then rates could stay lower for even longer. <br>
				<br>
				<b>The global meltdown has changed a number of fundamentals that 
				were taken as a given. What in your view is the big story of 
				2009? </b><br>
				Emerging markets. Everyone is long on dollars, we know that 
				central banks have four and a half trillion in dollar deposits, 
				private sector has a trillion. If I am wrong and the US does 
				well then everyone with dollars will do well, because they 
				cannot get rid of them wholesale. The advice for people is to 
				have a diversification policy away from dollars and not to shift 
				from dollars to sterling or euro but away from the dollar to the 
				Brazils, Indias, Chinas, the South Americas of the world, branch 
				out and diversify and look to the dynamic, emerging markets of 
				the world in order to bring growth. If the emerging markets are 
				going to grow at a fast clip then there is where the capital is 
				going to go. <br>
				<br>
				These countries are very commodity intensive, so people are 
				getting into the commodity side and that is the big story. 
				Whether it is genuine or not is an interesting question. One 
				thing that I have learnt about the financial market is that 
				pricing is much more aggressive and virulent than you thought 
				possible and once it boils over, it goes everywhere. But you 
				never know what that point of time is. In 1997, Alan Greenspan 
				called it irrational exuberance, in 1999 he was calling it the 
				new economy. In Dubai people talked about a bubble seven years 
				ago, six years ago and five years ago and then three years ago, 
				everything became genuine. <br>
				<br>
				<b>The Anglo-Saxon model of development has been a consumption 
				driven model of growth. Will emerging models follow the same 
				course or be different?</b><br>
				Rather than consumption growth, emerging markets are looking at 
				investment growth within themselves and that is very resource 
				intensive. No one will take on the slack of the US and so global 
				growth will be slower. Emerging markets need a lot of 
				infrastructure growth and when such projects and funding come 
				they are resource intensive. <br>
				<br>
				So if you want to buy in emerging markets, there are many ways 
				of doing this – one way is to buy equities of multinational 
				companies that offer governance and stakeholders’ involvement in 
				emerging markets; the other way is to buy currencies in these 
				markets or commodities themselves. If you are brave enough then 
				you go to any of these countries and buy an asset in any method. 
				So there are different methods and that is what the market is 
				hungry for.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is your take on China and India and can we expect a free 
				floating renminbi anytime soon?</b><br>
				China will get appreciation starting only in the second half of 
				next year. Chinese are not in a rush. A Chinese official once 
				told me that the country will have a free floating currency 
				soon, so when I asked him what is soon, he said in the next 500 
				years. The beauty of the renminbi is that unlike other 
				currencies in which we do not have a sense of direction or 
				timing, in the case of renminbi we only don’t know the timing, 
				but we definitely know the direction, so it is a winning 
				currency. <br>
				<br>
				In the case of India, an economist said that he was bearish 
				about his own country India because the budget deficit was going 
				to be in double digits or 11 per cent and I said I would swap 
				that any day. When the UK and US had a 2.3 per cent budget 
				deficit and UK had under 40 per cent debt to GDP, they looked 
				down upon any country with double digit deficit. But that has 
				changed, the US and UK can no longer look down on anybody as 
				they have the same problems. <br>
				<br>
				<b>The crisis started in the US and spread across. Do you expect 
				the US to come out strongly in 2010?</b><br>
				The further you fall, the faster you rise, that is the natural 
				phenomenon of economies but it does not mean anything. In a way 
				the US will get back to three and three and a half per cent 
				growth next year, but that is not the point, the point is where 
				is long term trend growth. Because if you go back to Japan in 
				the 1990s after the crisis, trend growth had not fallen from six 
				per cent to four per cent but to one per cent; you would have 
				never said that this is the year of Japan.<br>
				<br>
				The question is what is the long term sustainable growth rate of 
				the US? Is it three and a quarter? It’s probably two and that’s 
				what comes as a shock. We reckon that the US will need three and 
				a half per cent to four per cent growth over the next ten years 
				to get back to the trajectory where we thought we would be a few 
				years ago but that is not really possible. So the US has to 
				accept a massive loss of output. The dollar will still be the 
				reserve currency of the world but it will not be the anchor of 
				stability and safety that people want it to be. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What have we learnt from crisis?<br>
				</b>Nothing. During the Nasdaq bubble every one said bubble but 
				just before the Nasdaq bubble burst in 1999, everyone thought 
				this was a genuine productivity miracle or the oil price 
				example. Everyone said bubble at $50, $60, $80, $90 per barrel. 
				When it reached $140 everyone said $200; in Dubai as property 
				prices went up everyone said bubble. But just before prices went 
				bust everyone said you must buy it. People will repeat the same 
				mistake all the time. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Quick Take</b><br>
				&gt; Emerging markets are the big story of the year<br>
				&gt; Investment growth to drive emerging markets <br>
				&gt; US to grow at around 2% in the next ten years<br>
				&gt; Interest rates in the US will remain at zero per cent for the 
				next 12 months<br>
				&gt; The world has learnt nothing from the crisis<br>

				<b>The Dubai debt crisis has put a question mark on the 
				sustainability of the emirate’s build-and-they-will-come 
				development model. Mayank Singh reports</b><br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/finance_img1_jan2010.jpg" width="200" height="45" align="left" hspace="9" vspace="5">The 
				sun never sets on Dubai World’ – the saying ringed hollow on 
				November 25, 2009. On that fateful day, Dubai World asked its 
				creditors for a standstill agreement till May 2010, as it sought 
				to restructure debt to the tune of $26bn at Dubai World and 
				property developers Nakheel and Limitless. Close to $60bn of 
				Dubai’s $80bn debt is owned by Dubai World. The most affected 
				among investors will be the holders of Nakheel, Dubai World’s 
				property developer subsidiary. About $3.5bn of convertible bonds 
				issued by Nakheel was due for repayment on December 14.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Adverse fallout</b><br>
				The developments affected markets across the globe, triggering 
				fears that the global crisis had come to the Middle East. 
				Markets across the world fell by five per cent on fears that 
				this could delay the economic recovery for much longer and set 
				off another recessionary trend. Such misgivings were soon 
				dispelled as stock markets recovered sharply. Moody’s and S&amp;P 
				immediately cut their rating for Dubai-based government related 
				entities and placed them on credit watch, with negative 
				implications. According to a Financial Times report, The Royal 
				Bank of Scotland was the most exposed foreign bank with 
				$1bn-$2bn worth of loans. HSBC, Standard Chartered and Lloyds 
				Banking Group followed with about $1 billion each.<br>
				<br>
				The near default surprised some analysts, but not all. Dubai 
				raised over $12bn in financing in 2009 alone and $36bn in 
				syndicated loans between January 2007 and October 2009. On 
				November 4, Barclay’s Capital recommended Dubai’s debt as a good 
				investment, citing ‘several developments to act as positive 
				catalysts’: the repayment of Nakheel’s sukuk or Islamic bond, 
				the second tranche ($10bn) of a $20-billion loan from Abu Dhabi 
				and a successful merger between Emaar and Dubai Holding, two 
				other Dubai World companies. On the same day Moody’s slashed 
				ratings on five of Dubai state-related entities. On November 25, 
				Barclay’s Capital quickly backtracked on its earlier assessment 
				stating – ‘The credibility of Abu Dhabi to support Dubai with 
				respect to its financing needs is dented, in our view, eroding 
				the main pillar of Dubai’s credit worthiness.’<br>
				<br>
				One of the immediate consequences of the emirate’s decision to 
				seek a standstill agreement with Dubai World’s creditors is that 
				it will curtail its ability to raise financing through capital 
				markets. Analysts say that in the current climate it will be 
				almost impossible for Dubai to issue bonds and tap fresh loans 
				because of the damage to its credibility. This in turn will 
				affect its ability to refinance debts. On the positive side the 
				emirate though has a number of respected businesses such as DP 
				World, the ports company, Dewa the utilities company and 
				Emirates Airlines and an unrivalled position as a regional 
				tourist, trade and financial hub. But unlike its wealthy 
				neighbours it has meager oil resources.<br>
				<br>
				Dubai’s nominal GDP reportedly grew to $82bn (Dhs301.6bn) in 
				2008 with mining, oil and gas contributing just $1.76bn 
				(Dhs6.37bn), while wholesale, retail trade and repairing 
				accounted for $32.30bn (Dhs116.3bn) and real estate and business 
				services $12.33bn (Dhs44.4bn). Dubai’s revenue has been largely 
				dependent on government-related entities such as Dubai World, 
				plus tourism and some customs and administration fees and road 
				tolls. Part of Dubai’s success has been its tax free status, but 
				that also means that it cannot raise taxes to meet any revenue 
				shortfall.<br>
				<br>
				One option would be to sell some of its assets which stretch 
				beyond the UAE’s shores like its stake in retail brands such as 
				Barney’s, a golf complex in South Africa, a holding in the Ski 
				resort near Aspen in the US and the QE2 cruise liner. However 
				given the slowdown in the West obtaining good valuations on 
				these assets would be a steep challenge. Dubai World says that 
				it has assets worth $75bn, but bankers say a large chunk of this 
				is locked in hard-to-sell land bringing the value down to about 
				$50bn.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Looking for a bailout</b><br>
				Given such a scenario, most investors were looking at the UAE as 
				a lender of last resort for the emirate. On December 4, UAE 
				handed a $10bn bailout to Dubai. An official statement said – 
				“The government of Abu Dhabi has agreed to fund $10bn to the 
				Dubai Financial Support Fund that will be used to satisfy a 
				series of upcoming obligations on Dubai World. As a first action 
				for the new fund, the government of Dubai has authorised $4.1bn 
				to be used to pay sukuk (Nakheel Islamic bonds) obligations that 
				are due today.”<br>
				<br>
				Dubai has worked closely with the Central Bank of the UAE and 
				the government of Abu Dhabi to find a solution to the debt 
				problems said a statement issued by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al 
				Maktoum, head of the Dubai Supreme Financial Committee. The 
				statement added that ‘the remainder of the $10bn will provide 
				interest expenses and company working capital through April 30, 
				2010”, but it said that the latter will be “conditioned on the 
				company being successful in negotiating a standstill as 
				previously announced.” This means that Dubai World will still 
				have to go back to creditors to restructure its remaining debt.<br>
				Dubai also set up a special court on December 4, 2009 to oversee 
				the financial reorganisation of the $26bn debt owned by Dubai 
				World. The special court or tribunal will use insolvency laws of 
				the Dubai International Financial Centre to settle financial 
				disputes between Dubai World and its creditors.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Contagion effect<br>
				</b>Oman has little to fear from the crisis as it has a limited 
				exposure to the crisis. On December 6, three of Oman’s banks 
				announced that they had a total exposure of $77mn (29.64mn rials) 
				to the troubled conglomerate. Bank Muscat, has a $50mn (19.25mn 
				rials) exposure to a syndicated loan, followed by National Bank 
				of Oman’s $22.6mn (8.7mn rials) and Bank Sohar $4.3mn (1.6mn 
				rials) exposure. All the banks said that their loans were still 
				being serviced. HE Hamood Sangour al-Zadjali, Executive 
				President, Central Bank of Oman said, “The exposure announced by 
				three banks was ‘about the total’ and that there was no need to 
				require local banks to book provisions for their exposure as it 
				was not related to loans under restructuring.” A CEO of a family 
				owned firm feels that if distributors and marketers in Dubai 
				start offloading merchandise at fire sale prices in the face of 
				plummeting demand it may have some impact on Oman. But for now, 
				Oman is sitting pretty. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said 
				about Dubai. <br>

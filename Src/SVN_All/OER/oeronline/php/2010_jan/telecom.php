				<b>Taking charge of a mobile reselling company which is on a 
				roll is by no means an easy task, but Joakim Klingefjord, CEO of 
				renna, has his task cut out, finds out Visvas Paul D Karra</b><br>
				<br>
				<img src="images/telecom_img1_jan2010.jpg" width="250" height="208" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Joakim 
				Klingefjord, CEO of renna has his hand clearly on the telecom 
				pulse of Oman when he says that this is an exciting time for 
				renna as it continues to pioneer the mobile telecommunications 
				landscape and set new industry benchmarks. And it is easy to see 
				why this statement comes from Klingefjord because renna has been 
				exceeding all its expectations of customers intake that crossed 
				the 75,000 mark within six months of its launch in May 2009.<br>
				<br>
				Backed up by his varied experience in the mobile 
				telecommunications industry including 3G, Klingefjord brings 
				forth a critical insight and enviable track record of strategic 
				planning and implementation from diverse markets like 
				Scandinavia, the ‘mother’ of telecom markets; Latin America; 
				North America and Australia. Prior to joining renna, Joakim was 
				in the team that launched 3G in Scandinavia under the brand name 
				3. In addition, Joakim has worked in the management team in 
				Scandinavian mobile retailer chains.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Mobile mode</b><br>
				Prior to June 2008, the choices for mobile customers were 
				limited to Oman Mobile, the government incumbent, and Nawras the 
				private player. With the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA) of 
				Oman granting five new Class II licences for mobile resellers 
				under the government’s liberalisation policy, things were never 
				the same again. FRiENDi Mobile and renna were the first two 
				resellers to launch their operations having made an agreement 
				with Oman Mobile. Customers were immediately attracted to the 
				resellers, thanks to their attractive pricing strategies with 
				local and international call rates undergoing drastic <br>
				price reductions.<br>
				<br>
				Meanwhile, renna positioned itself as a 100 per cent Omani 
				company with simplicity as their slogan to attract Omanis and 
				expatriates. The mobile reseller also introduced innovative 
				features like instant messaging, after every call, informing 
				about your remaining balance; and a facility to call someone 
				even though you have no credit balance.<br>
				<br>
				“We continue on the route we set initially for us as a mobile 
				reseller by focusing on cost conscious Omanis and expatriates 
				looking for call rates that were easy on the pocket with no 
				hidden costs but with all the services that you expect from a 
				mobile service provider,” says Klingefjord. The term ‘cost 
				conscious’ has many demographics and many segments, he adds, 
				while explaining that it could cut across several denominators 
				but mainly those who communicate a lot using their mobiles to a 
				large extent.<br>
				“Specific segments include housewives, youth, housemaids etc. 
				They are all looking for cost efficient ways to communicate. The 
				way to communicate could mean the way the product is available, 
				the availability of recharge and the way we promote our 
				services,” Klingefjord explains.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Stellar service</b><br>
				Klingefjord has been with renna since its inception and played 
				an instrumental role in the operations of the company working 
				closely with his predecessor Niklas Nielsen, who has since 
				assumed a new responsibility as board advisor to focus on 
				developing new business opportunities and regional expansion.<br>
				<br>
				“With over 3.6 million users, the mobile market in Oman is 
				exciting and has a huge potential and makes the environment 
				extremely competitive. Therefore, understanding the needs and 
				expectations of customers and establishing a strong 
				customer-centric approach is essential to maximise service 
				efficiency and business profitability,” says Klingefjord, when 
				asked about his strategy for renna.<br>
				<br>
				Klingefjord’s relatively short Middle East experience is 
				compensated by virtue of him being a telecom man for over 20 
				years and he says even though his experience is limited 
				geographically, the good thing is that the telecom industry is 
				global with the same business mechanics.<br>
				<br>
				Commenting on the Omani telecom sector, Klingefjord says this 
				market is quite mature in terms of the number of active SIM 
				cards but on the other hand, it is still in its infancy in terms 
				of services deployed and used. Before the resellers arrived, it 
				is clear that the competition was less but with more resellers 
				entering the fray, it is going to be an interesting competition. 
				Again being a branded reseller, you can make a business case out 
				of a smaller customer base, Klingefjord says while adding that 
				this way they will be able to focus on specific segments. Big 
				network operators cannot cater to all the smaller business 
				segments, and that is where the opportunities abound for 
				resellers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Scope for services</b><br>
				“Based on my experience in Latin America and other markets, one 
				of the things about this market is that the penetration of new 
				services is still low as compared. Many services are available 
				but are not utilised fully. There are lots of things that can be 
				done on the handsets like e-commerce, e-banking and many other 
				things like that,” says the renna CEO while maintaining that a 
				lot of local content services can be provided and a lot of 
				interesting communities to communicate could be created using 
				all available technologies including 3G.<br>
				<br>
				Klingefjord is expected to fulfil the company’s commitment to 
				the government, customers and other stakeholders to add value to 
				Oman’s telecommunications industry through the creation of jobs 
				and attractive price plans and services and drive the 
				shareholder value. His perceptive leadership style and expertise 
				in product management and service development will be leveraged 
				to build a strong customer base and ensure continued and 
				efficient local operations.<br>
				<br>
				Countering the talk in the market that renna is not visible 
				enough, Klingefjord points out that it is all about 
				communicating and sharing the moment. Being a mobile reseller 
				means that they do not have the big budgets, like the big 
				network operators, to spend on newspaper advertisements. “Agreed 
				that visibility is not there but we do communicate with our 
				existing customers. We would like to be more ‘known’ than 
				‘visible’ through other means like buzz marketing where we have 
				more people talk about our brand and products. At the end of the 
				day we need to recoup our investments from our customers itself. 
				Therefore, having a healthy customer base and building it up is 
				important,” says Klingefjord. <br>
				<br>
				According to him, Oman has one unique feature and that is people 
				carry more than one SIM card. Customers do not necessarily throw 
				the old SIM card away but they use it less frequently. And the 
				challenge for all players is to become the first choice of the 
				customer and that will happen when you have philosophy of being 
				extremely transparent whether you are making national or 
				international calls. And being transparent has been renna’s core 
				philosophy all along, Klingefjord says.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Riding the competition</b><br>
				renna is standing pretty well and is all geared up for the 
				future, which in this case translates into two more competition 
				with the entry of two more mobile resellers, namely Mazoon 
				Mobile (launched in December) and Samatel (expected in 
				February).<br>
				<br>
				One of the strong points of this confidence in Klingefjord is 
				the fact that a mobile reseller like renna need not worry about 
				a full network. Therefore, to recoup, their prime focus is on 
				marketing and selling the wholesale minutes bought from the 
				network operator. “We are at the moment very comfortable. We 
				have a good network, we have services that are best in the 
				Sultanate, prices that are unparalleled and cost effective. Yes, 
				we will face two new competitors. But we have to see where they 
				will position themselves, what sorts of services and packaging,” 
				he says. <br>
				<br>
				As the market becomes more dynamic with more promotions from all 
				the operators, everyone (mobile companies) will have to respond 
				and then everyone will know where they stand. Until then, 
				Klingefjord is quite content with the reach of renna in the 
				market. <br>

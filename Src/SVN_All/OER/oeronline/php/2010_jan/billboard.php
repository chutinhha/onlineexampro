                      devices are becoming a popular platform – the ‘fourth screen’ 
                      – for people to enjoy digital content and share their experiences. 
                      High end mobile phones have evolved to multimedia computers 
                      that offer the functionalities of many portable single-purpose 
                      devices (camera, music player, pocket computer, GPS and 
                      more) in a multi-purpose converged device that is always 
                      with you and always connected. <br>
                      <br>
                      At the forefront of this convergence is the Nokia Nseries, 
                      which combines benefits of cutting-edge technology in one 
                      converged device that goes wherever you go. According to 
                      our consumer research, making phone calls represents only 
                      12 percent of the time a Nokia Nseries device owner uses 
                      his/her device during the day – the remaining 88 percent 
                      is spent on other activities. <br>

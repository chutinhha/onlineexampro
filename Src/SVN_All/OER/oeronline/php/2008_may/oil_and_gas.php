		<b>Petroleum Development Oman’s new five-year plan is targeting to 
		radically change the way it manages its business priorities as it 
		prepares to compete with more private-sector companies <br>
		</b><br>
		<img border="0" src="oil.jpg" width="200" height="255" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="4">With the end of the celebrations of 40 years of crude-oil shipment, 
		Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has embarked on a new five-year plan 
		(2008-2012) for sustainable development. In the next five years, PDO 
		will be executing eight new field-development projects, each of which is 
		valued at over US$100 million, and a further 50 new field-development 
		projects worth between US$20 million and US$100 million each.<br>
        <br>
		PDO’s managing director John Malcolm said, “In 2007, average production 
		for the year stood at more than 561,000 barrels per day, within the 
		target range of 560,000 to 570,000 barrels per day. Our 2008 production 
		target range is between 540,000 and 560,000 barrels per day. And for a 
		few years beyond 2008, our production will continue to stay at around 
		550,000 barrels per day...<br>
		<br>
		“There will be a significant increase in condensate production, thanks 
		to the Kauther gas field. In fact, our condensate production will almost 
		double this year. Our gas production will also increase, thanks not only 
		to the Kauther project but also to other gas-field development projects. 
		In energy-equivalent terms, our total hydrocarbon output will reach 
		unprecedented heights over the next five years.” (See graph: Oil, 
		Condensate &amp; Gas Production.)<br>
		<br>
		Despite steady decline in black oil production from 2002 onwards and 
		growing cost of exploration and production, Malcolm promised that “PDO 
		will reach new unprecedented heights on its way to 2012, securing a 
		bright future for the people of Oman”. On his game plan to achieve his 
		ambitious target, he said, “We are radically changing the way we manage 
		our business priorities so that they can be executed with much greater 
		efficiency – even as our day-to-day operations become more and more 
		complex. Our work practices and the frame of mind with which we approach 
		them will continue to change. For one thing, work will be passed on from 
		team to team, through better interfaces. And for another, we will have 
		to compete with more private-sector companies on their own terms.”<br>
		<br>
		<b>Specialised operations</b><br>
		“We will also be specialising our operations according to the recovery 
		process involved in a particular field-development project – whether 
		primary, secondary or enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Similar 
		specialisation may also be required according to the types of wells that 
		need to be drilled, the types of surface facilities that need to be 
		operated, and so on. Such specialisation – which we call ‘portfolio 
		segmentation’ – will make it much easier to standardise procedures. And 
		that too will yield additional efficiency. And, of course, we have to 
		rely even more on the application of advanced technology,” said Malcolm.<br>
        <br>
		He added, “PDO’s strength in integrating its assets, technology and 
		people will also contribute to its future success. Keeping all our 
		complexity under one roof, even as we continue to specialise and 
		standardise to deal with it, gives us an advantage that few companies 
		can match. We will integrate our large portfolio of productive assets, 
		the dedication of our people, some of the world’s most advanced 
		technology and our economies of scale, to meet our stated objectives.”</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Challenges ahead</b><br>
		With a focused vision and the resources to convert it into a reality, 
		PDO is all set to achieve its sustainable development objectives but the 
		journey will test the turnaround capability of the company to its 
		maximum. Malcolm realises this as he says, “…the future remains 
		challenging. As we look forward through the next decade and beyond, we 
		can see an increasing number of constraints being imposed on our 
		increasingly complex operations. Overall, Oman’s rapid industrial 
		development is leading to greater calls on the Sultanate’s large but 
		still limited gas supplies. This means that we need to find ways of 
		sustaining oil production while keeping our energy requirements under 
		tight control. To run all our operations, we will need to more than 
		double our power generation capacity over the coming five years.<br>
		<br>
		“Fortunately, the gas that is burned at our power stations yields not 
		only electricity but also heat, which we can use to boil water for our 
		steam-injection projects. Such ‘co-generation’ of electricity and steam 
		enables us to save quite a bit of gas – as much as what Muscat currently 
		consumes for its supplies of electricity and drinking water. We have 
		also been successful in reducing the flaring of gas associated with oil 
		field production. In the Natih field, for example, we have installed 
		sophisticated well controllers that regulate the gas/oil ratio in the 
		well fluids being produced, retaining as much gas as possible in the 
		field. As a result, we can reduce the flaring of the gas associated with 
		oil production and maintain the pressure of the field, resulting not 
		only in less greenhouse-gas emissions but also in a longer productive 
		life for the field. We intend to continue implementing these and other 
		measures to reduce flaring. In fact, between now and 2015, we intend to 
		capture some 100 billion cubic feet of gas that would otherwise have 
		been flared. These gas-conservation measures not only minimise PDO’s 
		demand for gas but also its greenhouse-gas emissions.”<br>
		<br>
		He added, “Although we have managed to moderate our gas usage, we are 
		much more limited as to what we can do to moderate engineering and raw 
		material costs. Our steel prices have increased by more than 50 per cent 
		since 2000, while engineering and project management costs are not far 
		behind. Still, the large-scale of our operations has enabled us to 
		exercise considerable leverage in price negotiations with our key 
		suppliers. Skills are also in short supply throughout the region, and we 
		face an ongoing battle to retain the senior technical staff to take our 
		multiple projects forward. There is little evidence that this situation 
		will improve in the coming years.”<br>
		<b><br>
		PDO in the next 5 years</b><br>
		For the next five years, some 35,000 people the combined PDO staff and 
		contractor workforce – will be involved in PDO’s operations. That 
		amounts to 1 million manhours of work every three days. The company will 
		be managing 120 fields, with more than 5,000 oil wells by 2012, and 90 
		per cent of what they produce won’t be oil but water – water that has to 
		be separated from the oil and re-injected into the ground in an 
		environmentally responsible way. PDO will be concurrently executing 
		eight new field-development projects, each of which is valued at over 
		US$100 million, and a further 50 new field-development projects worth 
		between US$20 million and US$100 million each.</font></p></td>

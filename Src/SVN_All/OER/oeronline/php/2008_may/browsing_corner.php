		1990s, the change over to industrialisation had taken place. Starting 
		only in the early 1990s really, “the metamorphosis from farmland to 
		factories was fast”. That’s the real story of China’s economic 
		development. China transformed vast areas of crop fields into industrial 
		land; sent farmers into factories.<br>
		<br>
		By contrast, going by the advice of Prof Mahalanobis in the 1950s, that 
		India needed a strong dual economy, with matching contributions coming 
		from both the industrial and the agrarian sectors, Jawaharlal Nehru, 
		driven further into conviction by the exhortations of Dr Viswesarayya, 
		ventured into state-supported industrialisation of a nation that was 
		totally dependent on agriculture. That it took about half a century to 
		transform into a workable model, and start reflecting in the GDP growth, 
		is a dimension of the size of the population.<br>
		<br>
		Economic evolution is an intrinsic part of The Elephant and the Dragon. 
		Up to the late 1970s, China and India’s economies were comparable. Since 
		then, China is doing a better job of bettering the lives of its 
		citizens. India is leading in computer software but in almost everything 
		else China is advancing more rapidly.<br>
		While China built up its economic strength by investing heavily in the 
		manufacturing industry and facilitating foreign trade, the service 
		sector has become a leading driver behind India’s economic growth, 
		contributing to more than half of its total economic growth since the 
		1990s. Despite their very different approaches, however, both countries 
		can learn from each other in many ways.<br>
		<br>
		Traditionally, advanced economies derive a sizeable contribution from 
		the services sector. This essential difference between the two economies 
		is not really stressed by Meredith. That higher education in China is 
		yet to impact itself on the evolution of indigenous technology is 
		ignored. But Meredith, thanks to her parleys with some of the finest 
		captains of industry in India, has been able to lay out a fairly vivid 
		resume of the emergence of the largest computer-literate population, and 
		the third largest technically trained workforce in the world. China and 
		India together account for about 37.5 per cent of the world’s population 
		and 6.4 per cent of the value of world output and income, at current 
		prices and exchange rates. As the two countries play an increasingly 
		weighty role in the world economy, their expansion is having a 
		noticeable impact on global growth, through a number of channels, with 
		trade and transfer of technology being arguably the strongest and most 
		direct.<br>
		<br>
		Although the two Asian ‘mega-emergers’ appear to have much in common, 
		they have in fact been following two different development paths. China 
		initiated its state-led modernisation reform in the late 1970s, after 
		many years of operating according to the Soviet model. India has relied 
		largely on the private sector to drive reform.<br>
		<br>
		What’s intriguing, though, is that Meredith’s focus is on how America 
		will reorient itself. Coupled with the misplaced concept, that China’s 
		foray into world markets could be a standard of ‘globalisation’, one 
		wonders if Meredith is myopic around America, while it is really these 
		two economics that are really impacting the world system. <br>
		<br>
		Globalisation goes beyond mass manufacture, economies of scale and 
		screwdriver technology. It has more to do with global finance, global 
		manpower systems and being a responsible global corporate citizen living 
		according to global commercial laws. The doyens of Indian industry have 
		practised these tenets. China still suffers from a lack of credibility 
		about many areas of business, except in the efficacy of the world’s 
		cheapest production system for many products.<br>
		<br>
		In the end analysis, The Elephant and the Dragon is all about research 
		and readings on the economies of the two Asian nations. Not so much 
		about reading into the findings from the third point of view. </font></p>

<b>A marketing perspective from AC Nielsen on the considerations that the 
Financial Services Industry in the GCC region need to look at before a merger.<br>
<br>
</b>
<img border="0" src="m.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="151" height="255">Mergers and acquisitions in the region are becoming more and more common. As 
banks and other financial institutions eye the GCC landscape, and look at its 
staggering growth rates, the opportunities to acquire and absorb a current 
player are increasingly being whetted by various players in the industry. But 
mergers can too often be minefields, if not dealt with outside of the 
traditional balance sheet analysis. Leading management consultants claim that 
the majority of mergers do not earn back the costs in the short run. What’s 
more, mergers and the talk surrounding them can hurt stock prices. And mergers 
typically produce confusion, conflict, fear, anger and uncertainty among 
customers. This leads to customer poaching, as competitors target profitable 
customers who are not sure if the merger is in their best interests. Altogether, 
it can be an uncertain time for all.<br>
<br>
From a marketing perspective, being the voice of both the customer and the 
brand, we can see that there are a few considerations that firms need to take. 
These include: <br>
<br>
<b>To the customer, the brand becomes the merger:</b>
</font>
<p style="margin: 3px 10px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Like it or not, the 
world will see the new brand as a symbol of the “why” behind the merger. 
Developing the corporate brand so that it reflects the “why” accurately and 
appealingly is critical. It can happen only if you ask the same appropriate 
questions throughout the merger negotiations that you ask throughout the 
branding process: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Why and how does our growth depend on this merger?<br>
<br>
What does it do for us that we could not do on our own?<br>
<br>
What can we expect from the future?<br>
<br>
Will this merger shift our values, mission, or vision? <br>
<br>
What do our investors, our employees and our customers expect from us? <br>
<br>
Can we manage these expectations? How? <br>
<br>
What characteristics and competencies combine – and live – in our core brand? <b>
<br>
</b><br>
Failure to understand and articulate the brand from a customer perspective will 
likely lead to pressures on the merger itself.<br>
<br>
Communicate and position the deal: Visibility among the media, employees, 
customers, shareholders and regulators is at an all-time high during the 
announcement of a merger or an acquisition. Prepare clear, concise, consistent 
ways to communicate the business logic behind the deal to all audiences. Good 
and timely corporate communications will influence opinions of all 
constituencies. <br>
<br>
Leverage the brand: The intensity of the merger can offer moments of creative 
brilliance if you actively consider the brand’s role in the deal. It’s common, 
for example, in announcing the deal, for the big fish to swallow the smaller, 
along with its brand. This is not always good for long-term brand-building. 
Granted, it can pay to adopt one or the other of the existing corporate brands, 
if that brand will work hardest on behalf of the merged company and accurately 
reflect the combined vision and intent. And of course, sometimes other 
considerations force both brands to be subsumed within a new one.<br>
<br>
Stay consistent: Consistency is key to building brand credibility. Be sure to 
coordinate communications so that one merger partner does not unintentionally 
contradict the other. The designation of a single corporate spokesperson, a 
chief communications officer for both sides of a merger, indicates the 
acceptance of consistency as a critical element.<br>
<br>
Understand your brand: Prior to undergoing any merger, the consistencies or the 
disparities between brands should be investigated. By researching each brand 
among customers, marketers can understand the potential synergies and formulate 
necessary strategies to best deal with any merger.<br>
<br>
Create internal buy-in: A merger can be very scary for employees, who typically 
feel apprehensive when they start to think about what it means for the business, 
and more for them personally. Carefully thought out and well-executed internal 
communications, and the infrastructure to support the brand over time will pave 
the way.<br>
<br>
Track how you are going: In order to work out any customer impact and determine 
any brand-related responses, you need to be equipped with the right information. 
As such, you should regularly track your brands’ performance in relation to that 
of your competitors in your customers’ head space. Without this, you will be 
flying blind, the outcome of which can be very expensive.<br>
<br>
At Nielsen we believe success with your customers comes from how well you tell 
the story. The bank or brand with the best story wins. <br>

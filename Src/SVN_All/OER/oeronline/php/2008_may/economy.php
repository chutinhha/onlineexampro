<b>The goal of a GCC monetary union may be served well if government officials 
and central banks start considering what a Gulf single-currency might actually 
serve.</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="olive2.jpg" width="142" height="336" align="left">Midas, the king of Phrygia, was once offered his choice of any gift as a reward 
for pleasing the god Dionysus. Famously, the king chose that anything he touched 
should turn to gold. As the story goes, it wasn’t long before the king 
discovered to his cost that great wealth has its downsides.<br>
<br>
The central bankers’ of the GCC, meeting on April 6 in Doha, might empathise 
with Midas. Their long-standing attempts to form a monetary union by 2010 are, 
they say, still on course. Yet, the wildly varying rates of inflation among GCC 
members – triggered by booming commodity prices and a slumping dollar – threaten 
to scupper their timeline.<br>
<br>
The GCC’s own Midas touch, oil, is currently trading around the US$110 a barrel 
mark while gas prices, in which the Gulf is equally well-endowed, have increased 
by around 35 per cent so far this year. The result is a GCC flush with 
liquidity, and money supply growth, which in some cases is exceeding 40 per cent 
a year. As might be expected, this glut of cash is creating inflationary 
headaches for GCC members. Unfortunately, with the exception of Kuwait, their 
dollar-pegged currencies are forcing them to adopt a monetary policy precisely 
the opposite of that which is needed: they are dropping interest rates in line 
with the US Federal Reserve.<br>
<br>
<b>Inflationary pressures</b><br>
The situation is hitting members with varying degrees of severity. Qatar and the 
UAE are both experiencing double digit inflation, while year on year figures for 
Saudi 
<img border="0" src="economy1.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="135" vspace="5">Arabia show inflation there has risen by 1.7 per cent in the past month 
alone, taking February’s tally to 8.7 per cent. To throw these numbers into 
relief, five years ago CPI inflation in Qatar was as low as 2.3 per cent and 
broad money growth only 4.8 per cent.<br>
<br>
Adversity is a great bell-weather for organisations like the GCC; it either 
binds their members closer together, or pushes them further apart. In the case 
of the proposed GCC single currency, the response to the current monetary 
migraine does not bode well for the future. First, Oman announced in 2006 that 
its economy would not be ready to join the single currency by the 2010 deadline. 
In itself this need not have been a problem (think UK and the euro), yet the 
following summer Kuwait, typically considered a stalwart of greater GCC 
integration, switched its dollar peg to a basket of currencies.<br>
<br>
This represented – indeed represents – a problem for the monetary union. In a 
sense, Kuwait merely reverted back to the status quo ante (it had used a 
currency basket to value its dinar prior to 2003). Yet, maintaining the dollar 
peg was seen as a key prerequisite of eventual union. By dropping the peg, 
Kuwait was publicly demonstrating its dissatisfaction with the institutional 
inertia of the GCC central bankers’ committee.<br>
<br>
Since then, the dinar has been able to limit depreciation against a group of 11 
major currencies to 23 per cent over a five-year period, compared with 37 per 
cent for those GCC members who have maintained the peg. It is perhaps too early 
to say whether the basket has helped curtail inflation in Kuwait, but recently 
released figures for last December show inflation at 7.54 per cent; high, yes, 
but significantly lower than that seen in Qatar, the UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
Every month, it seems a new study, investigation or review into the dollar peg 
and its possible revaluation is announced, only for it to be later confirmed 
that yes, the peg will remain, and no, there will not for the present be any 
revaluation. What are their options though? A revaluation against the dollar 
will lead to a massive loss in external dollar-denominated assets and might 
possibly push the currency over the edge. Moreover, with less than two years 
before the single currency is due to come into effect, central bankers want to 
create as little turbulence as possible. Even a mild revaluation against the 
dollar will throw a spanner in the works. Hence, at their Doha meeting, the 
central bankers appeared not only to commit their currencies to the dollar peg 
at the current rate but also to peg the future single-currency to the dollar.<br>
<br>
<b>Looking at options</b><br>
Currently, the GCC seems to be coasting toward a monetary union few observers 
believe to be feasible within the given timetable. Rather than glide along on 
auto-pilot, now might be a good time for government officials and central 
bankers to start considering what a Gulf single currency might actually be for. 
The GCC sits on roughly 23 per cent of the world’s oil and gas reserves, and 
accounts for 1.5 per cent of its GDP. A GCC single currency has the potential to 
become a significant Forex player in its own right. So why not leave some 
options on the table?<br>
<br>
Option one, the preferred option, will no doubt be to maintain the dollar peg, 
with perhaps an agreed one-off revaluation when the new currency enters 
circulation. Option two will be to agree to a coordinated transition to a basket 
of currencies (and even commodities) along the lines of Kuwait–this will be a 
good policy to precede an eventual free float of the currency. The third option 
will be to peg the currency to an alternative: the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights 
(SDRs), for example. Pegging to the SDR will have the advantage of tying the GCC 
single currency to a basket, without the potential political headaches of 
determining its composition.<br>
<br>
The ultimate goal though must be a freely floating currency, and this should be 
sooner, rather than later. A variable exchange rate brings its own risks, but it 
allows the central bank to set an independent monetary policy that best suits 
the needs of the wider economy. In the case of the GCC, this will mean no longer 
being at the mercy of the Fed and having the ability to trim interest rates to 
match local inflation, growth and employment figures. Current non-monetary 
measures to beat inflation are perhaps one of the most regressive features of 
the GCC economies: subsidies are distorting markets, stifling competition and 
creating feedback loops for further inflation. The sooner the GCC is able to 
switch from these practices to orthodox monetary measures, the better for 
everyone.<br>
<br>
When they meet again in June, the GCC central bankers will no doubt be faced 
with the same questions as before. Perhaps, they should remember Midas, who 
eventually lost his golden touch, passing it on (as the legend goes) to the 
river Pactolus, which became a source of abundant wealth for future generations 
of Phrygians. The black gold of the Gulf will one day pass on too; the challenge 
facing the GCC remains how to make the best use of it now. If the result is a 
prosperous and developed region, with both political and economic independence, 
then that truly will be a golden legacy. They will struggle to achieve it though 
without their own, free, single currency.<br>

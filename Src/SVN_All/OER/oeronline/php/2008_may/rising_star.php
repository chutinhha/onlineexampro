		<b>All the four new entrants on the OER TOP 20 chart share a common trait – an 
ability to learn and react to the dynamics of a changing market. Mayank Singh 
reports<br>

<img border="0" src="ore_top20_64.jpg" width="249" height="321" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">When Krishnakumar Gupta joined Al Anwar Holdings just over a year ago, his 
mandate from the board of directors was clear – the company was looking at a 
drastic change of direction and the new CEO had a free hand in fashioning its 
future course. After some deliberation and thought, Gupta realised that to make 
the best of the emerging market opportunities, Al Anwar needed to bring in a 
fundamental change in its structure and operations. Keeping this in perspective, 
he unveiled his vision.<br>
Al Anwar would become a leading private equity investment company in the Middle 
East with a primary focus on financial services. The board backed the CEO’s 
vision statement. It also gave him the green signal to grow the company’s 
investments by 100 per cent in five years to RO20 million, with 60 per cent of 
this going into financial services, including insurance. <br>
<br>
Says Gupta, “Rather than managing a company, we now manage our investments.” 
While the company used to get most of its revenues as a share of profit from its 
subsidiaries (companies in which it held a controlling stake), it now generates 
most of its revenues from divestments. The change of track has worked wonders 
for the company’s numbers: Al Anwar’s revenues shot up from RO12 million in 2006 
to RO36 million in 2007, an increase of 216 per cent. Its profits have grown by 
450 per cent over the year. This has helped the company to break into the league 
of OER’s Top 20 companies. Says Gupta, “Companies which are proactive and are 
ready to learn will do well in Oman.”<br>
<br>
<b>An open attitude</b><br>
Being proactive and an ability to learn are the two qualities that are common to 
all the four new entrants (Galfar Engineering and Contracting, Areej Vegetable 
Oil, Oman Refreshment Company and Al Anwar) in OER’s Top 20 list. <br>
Let’s take another example. Galfar, a 35-year-old company in the Sultanate, went 
public, with its IPO (initial public offering) on the Muscat Securities Market 
oversubscribed by 14.5 times, raising US$2.26 billion. This was the biggest IPO 
on Oman’s capital market and raised RO60 million for funding the future 
expansion of the company. <br>
<br>
		<img border="0" src="ore_top20_65.jpg" width="199" height="283" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The public listing of a closely held company marked a watershed in the history 
of corporate Oman, as most of these companies have traditionally been wary of 
disclosure norms that a public company needs to follow. The success of Galfar 
has gone a long way in allaying such fears. “Our books are open, giving 
financial institutions the confidence to lend us larger sums of money increasing 
our financial capabilities,” says Hans Erlings, CEO, Galfar. The company has 
stormed the charts by making its debut at the No 2 position. Both Al Anwar and 
Galfar have shown the courage of conviction and their faith has been repaid in 
ample measure. <br>
Geographical diversity <br>
<br>
As the regional economy grows, we find that these companies have been quick to 
capitalise on the growing potential of the GCC market. Thus, Areej Vegetable 
Oils and Derivatives entered the Iraq and Yemen markets in 2007 with its blended 
oils. The company has had a presence in Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a number of 
years and the last two years has seen its market share grow by over 100 per cent. 
Says Prem Maker, executive director, Areej, “We export 80 per cent of our 
production and our first port of call is the GCC market, as the transportation 
costs in the region are limited.” Galfar has also been exploring possibilities 
beyond the shores of the Sultanate. The company is looking at executing 
contracts in the oil and gas space in the MENA region and in India. It points 
out that the return on investments in some of these markets is better than in 
Oman. <br>
<br>
Al Anwar has trained its sights much higher. Says Gupta, “We are looking at 
diversifying ourselves geographically in the GCC and India. At a later stage, we 
may go to China, Brazil, Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe.” The company has 
walked its talk by picking up a 25 per cent equity stake in Adex Capital, a 
financial services company in Saudi Arabia in 2007. It has invested in Almondz 
Global, a securities firm in India. As companies gain scale and confidence, the 
best of the lot are bound to look beyond the shores of Oman.<br>
<br>
<b>Innovating its way </b> <br>
All these four companies have shown remarkable innovation in the way they have 
lived up to their challenges. Faced with rising input costs such as corn oil and 
palm oil, which have seen a price escalation of 140 per cent and 60 per cent, 
respectively, Areej has been quick to put in place a blending strategy. “We have 
been blending lower priced oils with higher priced oils. This gives our products 
a fine balance between price and quality.” So despite a 60 to 140 per cent hike 
in the price of base oils, Areej has been able to keep its costs down. The 
company has been forced to hike prices but these have been capped at 50 per 
cent. An ability to break into new markets and the blending strategy has enabled 
the company to grow its topline by close to 40 per cent, while profits grew by 
over 20 per cent in 2007. <br>
		<br>
Oman Refreshment, the franchisee for Pepsi soft drinks and Aquafina pure 
drinking water, faced a piquant situation. Despite having a 92 per cent 
market share in Oman, it realised that it faced a growth problem. Says Mohamed 
Harazallah, general manager, ORC, “A company can grow either horizontally or 
vertically. As our business is limited to Oman, there are limitations to our 
vertical growth (geographical spread). So the other alternative is to grow 
horizontally.” As a part of this plan, the company won the franchise for Frito 
Lay’s range of snacks in the second half of 2007. The franchise was earlier with 
Bahwan Foods. The company is discussing the possibility of bringing in other 
Pepsi products to Oman. It is confident of adding three to four new brands to 
its product portfolio in 2008.<br>
<br>
Says Harazallah, “Since our competition is weak, we see ourselves as our 
competitors and this keeps us on our toes.” The company invested RO7 million in 
strengthening its production capacities last year. It installed a new can line 
doubling its existing capacity. Production increased from 14.5 million cases in 
2006 to 16.1 million in 2007, an increase of 11 per cent. A new Aqaufina water 
line with a capacity of 18,000 bottles per hour and a new juice line with 7,500 
packs per hour were added. The company has built a 4,000 sq. m warehouse at its 
factory in Ghala. These initiatives coupled with its robust performance 
(revenues – RO36 million and profit – RO2 million) has helped the company to 
make it to the OER Top 20.<br>
As competition between investment companies intensifies and valuations for deals 
skyrocket, Al Anwar realised that it may get increasingly difficult to win deals 
on its own steam. So, the company has decided to bid for deals jointly with 
other investment companies on a reciprocal basis. Such quick witted thinking is 
what differentiates winners from the also-rans.

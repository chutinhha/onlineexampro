        <b>Doug Lattner, CEO of Deloitte Consulting, recalls how taking 
        unconventional decisions actually resulted in great pay offs</b><br>
        <br>
        Doug Lattner says his first rule of business leadership is “know 
        yourself.” The CEO of fast-growing Deloitte Consulting applied that 
        lesson to his own firm when he assumed the reins of the New York-based 
        unit in 2003.<br>
        <br>
        At the time, Deloitte Consulting, which offered expertise in such areas 
        as strategy, technology and human resources, was serving more than 42 
        types of client groups. Lattner and his team grew the overall business 
        even as they slashed that number by more than half, serving just 19 
        segments.<br>
        <br>
        Narrowing its focus wasn’t the only unconventional decision made during 
        the five years that Lattner has been at the helm. The unit also scrapped 
        a planned management buyout and spinoff at the last possible minute, 
        necessitating a complicated reintegration with parent Deloitte &amp; 
        Touche.These against-the-grain strategies, Lattner said, brought 
        impressive results: The consulting firm, with 11,500 employees, has 
        grown at a much faster pace – 25 per cent last year alone – than its 
        main consulting rivals as well as the other units within Deloitte &amp; 
        Touche. <br>
        <br>
        The consulting field has grown and changed dramatically since 1975 when 
        Lattner was hired right out of business school into the five-person 
        Dallas office of what was then Touche Ross. Specialising mainly in 
        energy consulting, Lattner has stayed with the firm his entire career, a 
        time that included the merger of Touche Ross and Deloitte Haskins &amp; 
        Sells in 1989. Lattner works at the unit’s headquarters in Manhattan. 
        Lattner cites several reasons why most large accounting firms were 
        looking to discard their consulting functions back in 2003. One was that 
        most businesses tend to reduce their use of consultants during and right 
        after a recession, like the one that had occurred in 2001.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Trying times</b><br>
        Around 2003, the industry had suffered a rare period of negative growth. 
        But perhaps more importantly, the US Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley 
        Act, which aimed to prohibit accounting firms from performing non-audit 
        work for the same public companies they were auditing. Arthur Andersen, 
        Ernst &amp; Young and PriceWaterhouseCoopers all shed or spun off their 
        consulting arms as a result.<br>
        <br>
        At Deloitte, an initial plan for a management buyout of the consulting 
        unit was cancelled by the parent company’s partners at the 11th hour. 
        Instead, Lattner was asked to reintegrate the consulting arm back into 
        Deloitte and develop a strategy to seek contracts from the large pool of 
        public companies – more than three-quarters of them – that didn’t hire 
        Deloitte for auditing.<br>
        <br>
        Lattner said the firm learned quickly how to negotiate the new rules. 
        Consequently, links between the consultants and the tax-and-audit 
        specialists proved to be an advantage, not a hindrance. It is now 
        standard practice to offer tax-related consulting advice to these 
        non-auditing clients, Lattner adds, noting that one of the many areas in 
        which Deloitte Consulting advises companies is how to comply with 
        Sarbanes-Oxley.<br>
        <br>
        Deloitte Consulting has also realised that consulting works best as part 
        of a private firm or partnership instead of as a publicly traded company 
        answerable to its shareholders. “If you don’t take care of your 
        shareholders in a public environment, they sell your stock,” he says. He 
        notes that one rival, CapGemini, has seen the value of its purchase of 
        Ernst &amp; Young drop by some 90 per cent, according to Wall Street 
        estimates.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Workplace environment</b><br>
        Some of the most critical successes that Lattner and his management team 
        were able to achieve involved making Deloitte Consulting a more 
        attractive place to work, Lattner says, noting that one of the biggest 
        problems he inherited as CEO was a high employee turnover rate of 
        roughly 25 per cent.<br>
        <br>
        Since then, the company has worked to improve not just the workplace 
        environment, but also to offer new types of mid-career training. He says 
        the steps have curbed annual turnover to about 14 per cent. “We don’t 
        build cars and we don’t have retail shops – our people are our assets 
        and they vote every day with their feet – so we need to make sure in our 
        organisation that we are (providing them) with the right amount of 
        social activity, the right amount of work experience.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Lattner, his company is diverse enough to weather the 
        current storms in the US economy, including a new plunge in the 
        financial markets and worries about mortgage foreclosures and rising oil 
        prices. While banking and financial services firms have cut back on 
        their use of consultants, he notes, other so-called contra-cyclical 
        industries – like pharmaceuticals and the public sector – have increased 
        their spending in this area.<br>
        <br>
        He also sees great prospects in his former specialty of energy 
        consulting. “Oil and gas companies do not spend on consulting after the 
        price of a barrel goes below $30. But it’s $70 above $30... There’s a 
        lot of opportunity.” Another area for future growth will be 
        international consulting work. The company has targeted the BRIC 
        countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – with the greatest emphasis 
        now on India, where the Deloitte unit has a large pool of employees, 
        including about 2,000 in Hyderabad and about 800 in Mumbai.<br>

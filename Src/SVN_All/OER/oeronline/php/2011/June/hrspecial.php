						has to strike a balance between its actual requirements 
						and its natural beauty and traditional architecture, 
						says Ammar Suleiman Al Kharusi, Supervisor, Omran<br>
						<br>
						As a civil engineer with an astute and pioneering vision 
						for Oman’s urban development, Ammar Suleiman Al 
						Kharusi’s passion for property development begins from a 
						very tender age. He considers his current stint with 
						Omran as a call of destiny to work for materialising his 
						colourful dreams of a beautiful Oman studded with 
						attractive tourism destinations. <br>
						<br>
						Ammar who envisages a prospective future for the tourism 
						and construction sectors in the country believes that 
						each country or city has its own characteristics and 
						architectural identity. “We need to develop Muscat as 
						Muscat and not in the mould of any metropolis. For that 
						we have to harmonise the natural beauty of Oman and its 
						traditional architecture with the actual needs of our 
						time.” His vision for Oman’s urban development can be 
						summed up in his own words: “Develop the right thing 
						with right attitude and with right financials.”<br>
						<br>
						Hailing from an educated family, Ammar attributes his 
						success to his parents who were very particular about 
						the quality of their children’s education. Three of his 
						five sisters are doctors. He calls himself a proud 
						alumnus of National Private School, Al Khuwair. After 
						schooling, he left for UAE to do his Bachelor’s in Civil 
						and Environmental Engineering from the University of 
						Sharjah. Immediately after completing his studies, he 
						started working in UAE where he found immense 
						opportunities for a young civil engineer to thrive and 
						build up his career. With a lot of high-profile 
						projects, UAE offered him better exposure and a more 
						competitive environment to grow. “I got a chance to work 
						with Tenure Construction International, a reputable 
						project management company, and to be part of a number 
						of high-profile and prestigious projects such as Dubai 
						mall and various other projects in Abu Dhabi,” says 
						Ammar.<br>
						<br>
						The years spent in UAE as a student and a professional 
						helped Ammar make a solid foundation for his career. 
						However, he always cherished coming back to Oman to 
						apply his skills and experience and implement his vision 
						of urban development in the country. After five years, 
						he came back to Oman in 2010 to start his innings with 
						Omran. “I was lucky to join a company of Omran’s stature 
						which seldom recruits young professionals like me. 
						However, it has a comprehensive policy of Omanisation 
						and, in my case, my experience abroad in a more 
						competitive environment was <br>
						greatly helpful.”<br>
						<br>
						It is unsurprising that Steve Jobs, the founder and CEO 
						of Apple Inc., has cast a spell on him. The 
						perseverance, dedication and innovation with which Jobs 
						braved the challenges in his chequered career to emerge 
						as one of the successful business magnate and inventor 
						of our time has been inspiring for Ammar. He is also a 
						guitar hobbyist and a fan of James Hetfield and Jimmy 
						Page.

				Abdullah Al Zadjali, Control &amp; Automation Engineer, Mott 
				MacDonald feels that though Omani women have proved to be 
				outstandingly successful in different walks of life, they are 
				yet to change certain prejudices in society about their 
				capabilities and roles<br>
				<br>
				When a flamboyant Aliya Zadjali tells you that cooking is almost 
				a passion for her, you may not believe it, on the face of it. 
				But you cannot disagree with her as she goes on citing the 
				reasons for it and describing the underlying philosophy of a 
				process which starts from nothing and ends up preparing a 
				delicious stuff which makes your mouth water. It is this quest 
				for novelty and a sense of satisfaction in whatever she does 
				that makes her different and enabled her to be the only woman 
				among the three finalists of BizPro Awards 2011.<br>
				<br>
				Aliya does not believe in doing something for nothing or just to 
				serve a ceremonial purpose. That is why she was initially 
				reluctant to do an MBA which she thought was nothing more than 
				an ornamental addition to her résumé. But, once she realised the 
				importance of the course in adding value to her mission and 
				achieving her goals in life, she decided to do it. Aliya greatly 
				treasures the support and motivation she got from her parents 
				throughout her life. She is very much obliged to her mother who 
				sent her abroad for studies and stood by her at all junctures of 
				her educational and professional life. Aliya who did her entire 
				schooling in India earned her Bachelor’s in Electronics from MH 
				Saboo Siddik College of Engineering in Mumbai. She also earned a 
				diploma in electrical and video engineering. She believes that 
				her stay and study abroad have been instrumental in moulding her 
				personality and sharpening her skills thereby contributing to 
				her professional success.<br>
				<br>
				Coming back to Oman in early 2004, she joined Mott MacDonald as 
				control &amp; automation engineer. Though she has just completed 
				seven successful years in Mott MacDonald, Aliya knows very well 
				when consistency gives way to complacency. “I don’t like to be 
				complacent; I don’t like to do monotonous things. I am here 
				because I enjoy my work and gain a lot of knowledge. I am very 
				focused on what I am doing and do not want to be a jack of all 
				trades and a master of none,” says a determined Aliya. She 
				always sought to go beyond her comfort zone taking up new 
				responsibilities and braving challenges. <br>
				<br>
				Aliya says that Omani women have proved to be outstandingly 
				successful in different walks of life in the country. However, 
				she feels that they have yet to change certain perceptions and 
				prejudices of a male-dominated society about women’s 
				capabilities and their role in society.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				Mohammed Al Barwani, Team Leader, Corporate Banking, Ahli Bank 
				is optimistic about conquering new heights in his professional 
				ladder<br>
				<br>
				For Khalid Mohammed Al Barwani, banking is literally a 
				profession in his blood – a legacy he inherited from his father 
				who retired from Gulf International Bank (GIB) in Bahrain. This 
				young and aspiring executive who aspires to be a CEO of a bank 
				in future grew up watching his father climb up the career 
				ladder. That is why he attributes his professional success to 
				his dad who served as a mentor and a role model.<br>
				<br>
				After having his schooling in Bahrain, Khalid moved to UK to do 
				his BA (Hons) in Economic and Business Policy from the 
				University of Portsmouth (presently known as Portsmouth Business 
				School). This was followed by a Masters in Economics from the 
				same university. <br>
				Though he spent almost 19 years in Bahrain, Khalid had always 
				cherished coming back to Oman to serve his homeland. Besides, as 
				a growing economy Oman has offered a lot of opportunities for 
				young Omanis like him in various sectors including banking. 
				After his higher studies in UK, Khalid came back to Oman and 
				joined National Bank of Oman (NBO) as a management trainee. 
				Later, he joined HSBC as an executive management trainee. It was 
				during this time that he was sent to UK for a two-month 
				executive trainee development programme. Soon after completing 
				the course, Khalid was promoted as a Manager in HSBC. Before 
				leaving HSBC in 2008, he was again promoted as a senior 
				relationship manager.<br>
				<br>
				In September 2008, he joined Ahli Bank as a team leader. The new 
				job was a challenging responsibility as Ahli Bank was a new 
				player in the market and it was the beginning of the financial 
				crisis. But Khalid’s sound academic and professional background 
				helped him take it up with self-confidence. “I am tasked with 
				generating business from large corporates in Oman; and I look 
				after general trading and multinational companies. Though the 
				last two years has been challenging because of the financial 
				meltdown, our corporate banking business and the bank as a whole 
				has done very well,” says Khalid.<br>
				<br>
				As a leader, Khalid firmly believes in total team involvement. 
				“You need to get your team to buy into the vision or target 
				before you can achieve it. When someone has a good idea, 
				recognise it, reward it and let them take ownership of it. A 
				manager always takes credit while a leader gives the credit to 
				others,” he avers.<br>
				<br>
				He is also full of praise for the prompt action of the 
				government to address the demand of the youth in the aftermath 
				of the recent protests in the country. He thinks that it has 
				offered a lot of opportunities and addresses the problem of 
				unemployment. He encourages youth to seize all available 
				opportunities. <br>
				<br>
				Khalid also reveals that he will be utilising the BizPro 2011 
				scholarship to attend the IFF School of Project Finance in 
				London, an effective training programme for project finance 
				professionals run by International Faculty of Finance (IFF), UK.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				Mohammed Al Lawati, Senior Manager, Project Finance and 
				Syndication, National Bank of Oman predicts a crucial role for 
				ambitious and well- qualified Omani youth in drawing the future 
				course of their country’s development<br>
				<br>
				That he spends most of his leisure time reading books on banking 
				and finance and observing the latest nuances in this field all 
				over the world reveals how vigilant and serious he is about his 
				profession. It has been this passion to update and innovate 
				himself that enabled him to grow as one of the most successful 
				young executives in the country with a solid and sound academic 
				and professional background. A Fulbright scholar with a 
				long-term vision for Oman’s sustainable growth and development, 
				Mustafa definitely belongs to a special breed of dynamic, 
				ambitious and well-qualified Omani youth who are poised to play 
				a pioneering role in the future course of this country.<br>
				<br>
				As the senior manager of project finance and syndication, 
				Mustafa currently plays a decisive role in formulating the 
				policy of the bank with regards to financing various projects of 
				national importance such as power plants, new airports, 
				refineries and dry docks.<br>
				<br>
				Having started his career with treasury and covering various 
				areas of it gave him a macro picture of banking and stood him in 
				good stead as a professional. After having his bachelor’s from 
				the University of Missouri, St Louis, US, in finance and 
				accounting, Mustafa started his professional life with a French 
				company based in the United States where he worked for one year. 
				Later, he moved back to Oman to join Oman International Bank 
				where he worked in the treasury for one year. After joining NBO, 
				Mustafa handled different departments of treasury such as the 
				foreign exchange desk, Omani rial desk, international money 
				market desk and the derivatives and currency desk.<br>
				<br>
				It was during this time that he won the prestigious Fulbright 
				scholarship by the US government enabling him to do his masters 
				from the University of Cleveland in business administration, 
				banking and finance. He completed the programme scoring over 99 
				per cent marks. After completing his masters, Mustafa came back 
				to NBO and joined the corporate banking division and later 
				switched over to the project financing division as a senior 
				manager.<br>
				As an ambitious professional, he wants to explore new avenues 
				and take up more challenging positions that will be helpful both 
				for the organisation and the country as a whole. Referring to 
				his outlook for the next five years, Mustafa says he expects 
				himself to be handling more responsibilities which require his 
				expertise and calibre, either within NBO or in any other 
				government organisation.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				Al Mamari, Product Manager Data &amp; Internet, Nawras believes that 
				he is obliged to give back to society as he is indebted to the 
				country for his success<br>
				<br>
				When Monther joined Nawras late in 2009, there were hardly seven 
				months to go before the company launched Oman’s second 
				fixed-line network marking the start of a new era in broadband 
				accessibility in Oman. For Monther who was inducted as the head 
				of product development team, it was one of the most challenging 
				times in his career as he had to work under a very tight 
				schedule. But his vision, persistence and hard work paid off and 
				his previous experience in the telecom sector came in very handy 
				as he tackled the challenge head on.<br>
				<br>
				Monther has recently switched over to the sales support 
				department taking up more responsibilities. As a team leader, he 
				feels that his style of management varies from team-to-team. At 
				present, he is busy reshuffling the entire team. He works very 
				closely with each team member in order to extract his or her 
				opinion with regards to the future plan. Referring to his 
				interaction and mutual exchanges with the team members, Monther 
				says, “We do have certain internal targets, both service and 
				sales targets. I always make sure that the entire team gets 
				enough support to meet these targets. I myself go into the field 
				to ensure this.”<br>
				<br>
				Monther hails from Al Sharqiyah region. Having graduated from a 
				government school in Sur, he won a scholarship from the Ministry 
				of Higher Education which enabled him to pursue his higher 
				studies in Canada. He completed his Bachelor’s in Computer 
				Science from Saint Mary’s University in Halifax and did a minor 
				in Business Administration.<br>
				<br>
				Coming back to Oman in 2003, Monther joined Omantel as a network 
				administrator. He held different positions and was part of 
				various important projects initiated by the company such as ADSL 
				in 2005 and E-government in 2006. When he left Omantel after 
				four years, he was manager of the company’s Network Operation 
				Centre. Before joining Nawras, Monther has a short stint as the 
				territory account manager of Awaya, an international company. 
				Though initially he was working from home and was reporting to 
				the regional office in Dubai, he managed to set up an office in 
				Oman with a sales and support team comprising of 15 members.<br>
				<br>
				Monther is also an aspiring entrepreneur as he plans to call it 
				quits and launch his own business after a couple of years. 
				Besides, he is a certified diver and likes camping, fishing, 
				swimming and playing basketball. A firm believer in the spirit 
				of social services and charity, Monther thinks that he owes much 
				to the country and wants to give back.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				Mohammed Al Barwani, Corp. Planning and Development Executive, 
				Oman Oil Marketing Co, advocates a holistic approach to life and 
				the pursuit of personal excellence<br>
				<br>
				Azhar’s inherent dynamism and passion for exploring new avenues 
				surfaced at a very tender age. In addition to being selected as 
				a student leader in sports and extra-curricular activities, she 
				tried her hand at a variety of jobs during summer holidays in 
				marketing, IT, insurance and banking. Those summer jobs were 
				enriching experiences that have stood her in good stead as a 
				professional because they helped her gain valuable exposure to a 
				number of sectors and acquire skills and competence.<br>
				<br>
				As a management and commercial finance professional with over 12 
				years of experience in the oil and gas industry, Azhar believes 
				that her sound academic background and broad experience are 
				instrumental in her becoming a successful executive. Azhar did 
				her schooling in the UAE with International GCSEs (University of 
				Cambridge) obtaining academic excellence. She also secured 
				A-Levels in Computing and Pure &amp;Applied Mathematics from the 
				Universities of London and Oxford. Coming to Oman, Azhar 
				completed her BSc in Finance from the College of Commerce and 
				Economics in Sultan Qaboos University.<br>
				<br>
				After graduation, she started her career with PDO as contracts 
				engineer and developed to become a seasoned supply chain 
				analyst. While working in PDO, Azhar was selected for the 
				prestigious Fulbright scholarship by the US government and 
				enrolled in a PhD programme in management in the US. After a few 
				years, she left PDO and had a short stint as managing director 
				with Global Management Services.<br>
				<br>
				Currently she is the corporate planning and business development 
				executive in Oman Oil Marketing Co. This position blends her 
				skills as a strategic thinker and operational specialist, as she 
				is tasked with developing the frameworks, systems and planning 
				processes to align operations with the vision and corporate 
				strategies. With Oman Oil poised to undertake ambitious projects 
				aimed at diversifying its core business, Azhar aspires to play a 
				leading role in those ventures.<br>
				<br>
				Azhar has also volunteered some of her time in teaching and 
				empowering disabled students and doing social works in 
				organisations like the United Nations which have widened her 
				horizons beyond the boundaries of workplace.<br>
				<br>
				Azhar believes that women essentially have to put in more 
				efforts to succeed, owing to their household and professional 
				responsibilities that compel them to strive in order to maintain 
				a balance of priorities. She advocates a holistic approach to 
				life where measuring success on the basis of material factors 
				alone such as money or status is not sufficient.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				Oman to become an industrial power, the skills and capabilities 
				of its youth need to be harnessed and utilised properly, says 
				Said Ahmed Al Rawahi, Plant Logistic Manager, Europoles<br>
				<br>
				It was not for seeking a lucrative and greener pasture that Said 
				Al Rawahi gave up his prestigious teaching career at Royal Guard 
				of Oman Technical College some two years back. But it was due to 
				his realisation that his bookish knowledge would no longer be 
				helpful for the students as long as he does not acquire enough 
				practical experience in what he teaches. He firmly believes that 
				textbooks loaded down with a lot of information will not serve 
				their purpose unless and until they synchronise with hands-on 
				experience; and fears that certificate sans quality education 
				will churn out half-baked students with poor skills and 
				capabilities. It must be this aversion to an educational system 
				that concentrates more on giving certificates than maintaining 
				quality that prompted him to conceptualise an alternative 
				pedagogic plan for his children. “I do not want them to have 
				degrees, masters or PhDs. But I want them to have skills. I will 
				make them explore the world, improve themselves, enhance their 
				skills and find their space. If my son wants to become a 
				carpenter, I will definitely help him to be one of the best 
				carpenters,” says Said.<br>
				<br>
				An alumnus of Royal Guard Technical School, Said graduated with 
				an additional BTEC National Diploma of the British government in 
				1997. Then he was sent on a scholarship to the United Kingdom to 
				do his Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from the University 
				Crantil. After three years he came back as an IT teacher to his 
				Alma Mater where he taught students from the fifth grade to 
				Higher National Diploma which is equivalent to third year in the 
				University. After seven years, Said joined Europoles as plant 
				logistic manager at its production plant in Nizwa where he is 
				tasked with an array of responsibilities such as maintenance. of 
				the machinery, warehouse supervision, quality control and 
				delivery of poles. In the meantime, he had completed his masters 
				from Sultan Qaboos University Information Engineering.<br>
				<br>
				Asked about the contradictions in an IT wizard of his stature 
				working in an area which has nothing to do with his expertise 
				and ambitions, Said retorted saying: “If I have enough money, I 
				would have resigned from my current job and start my own 
				research in information technology.” He stressed the necessity 
				of having more investors in IT and related areas to tap the full 
				potentials of the youth of the country. He also warns that if 
				the skills and capabilities of the Omani youth are not harnessed 
				and utilised well the country’s industrial development will 
				suffer a lot.<br>
				<br>
				Said who suggests a complete overhaul in the educational system 
				in order to make it more industry-friendly also criticises the 
				attitude of some young Omanis to work. “Most of the fresh 
				graduates are aspiring for high-profile jobs and lucrative 
				salaries though they do not have sufficient skills to get it. 
				What do they have in mind are buying new cars and houses and 
				marriage,” he adds. He also advises them to reset their goals 
				and let their life be driven by a long term vision to develop 
				their skills and improve their professional expertise.

				<img border="0" src="images/HR9.jpg" width="130" height="148" style="border: 1px solid #808080; " align="left"></font>According 
				to Suleiman Khalfan Al Yahyai, Marketing Director, Samatel, 
				equipping oneself to meet the requirements of each new 
				responsibility is essential for the success of a professional<br>
				<br>
				When Suleiman started his career with Omantel as a fresh 
				engineering graduate back in 2000, what he did first was trying 
				to understand his job description thoroughly. He evaluated 
				himself against the responsibilities mentioned in the job 
				profile in order to understand the nature and magnitude of the 
				task in hand. This evaluation helped him to understand his 
				strength and weakness vis-à-vis the new job and equip himself 
				for that. He tried his best to adapt himself to the new 
				requirements of the job; and it took only 2-3 months for him to 
				understand and learn the tricks of the trade. It is this 
				attitude to face challenges head on and take the better of them 
				through dedication and hard work that helped him to excel as a 
				successful telecom engineer.<br>
				<br>
				Hailing from Al Hamra, Oman’s ancient city which is home to one 
				of the largest cave systems in the world, Suleiman did his 
				schooling from an Omani government school. He recalls that 
				though his father had no formal education, he used to read a lot 
				and was very particular about providing quality education to his 
				children.<br>
				<br>
				After schooling he joined Sultan Qaboos University to do his 
				Bachelor’s in computer engineering. When he completed the 
				Bachelor’s in October 2000, Suleiman was the first Omani 
				engineer to join Omantel’s international roaming division. He 
				was tasked with all technical responsibilities of the division. 
				After 2-3 years, he handled some managerial roles. In the 
				meantime, he has also completed his Master’s in business 
				administration from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow in 
				2007 which enabled him to strengthen his management skills. <br>
				<br>
				He joined Samatel as marketing director in January 2010 when the 
				company was set up. Though he was in the commercial unit, he has 
				worked in multiple roles looking after various departments in 
				the company. Later, when the CCO left the company three months 
				into the launch, Suleiman was appointed as the acting CCO 
				looking after all the commercial units. After the launch, he was 
				promoted as business development head of the company.<br>
				<br>
				Suleiman always looks for new challenges in the profession to 
				explore his talents and potential. He asks young Oamnis to equip 
				themselves for new responsibilities in order to boost their 
				self-confidence. He says once they could find their comfort zone 
				it would be difficult for anything to beat their morale. He 
				warns them against concentrating on earning degrees and 
				certificates with scant regard for practical knowledge.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				Salim Al Kharusi, formerly Assistant Chief Accountant, MB 
				Petroleum, believes that young Omanis are accountable not only 
				to the institutions they work for but also to the society and 
				nation as a whole</b><br>
				<br>
				When she won a scholarship from Oman LNG to go abroad for higher 
				education after having graduated with 94 per cent marks from 
				Wadi Kabir Higher secondary School, it was a dream come true for 
				Farkha Al Kharusi. Unlike her sisters who studied in Sultan 
				Qaboos University, Farkha wanted to go abroad for higher studies 
				because she always desired to sail in uncharted waters. Since 
				mathematics was her favourite subject, she wanted to pursue an 
				accounting career and left for the UK to do her Bachelor’s in 
				accounting and finance from the University of Leeds.<br>
				<br>
				She firmly believes that her four-year stay in Britain was 
				greatly helpful in moulding her personality. “Staying abroad 
				itself away from your home and dear ones gives you a lot of 
				strength. It acclimatises you with different cultures and 
				situations so that your personality gets the wherewithal to face 
				bigger and more serious challenges in life,” she says. Farkha 
				still recalls those black days when Arab and Muslim communities 
				were targeted in several parts of Britain in the aftermath of 
				9/11. “As I was wearing headscarves, it was very difficult for 
				me to go out because we were singled out for attack by some 
				hooligans.”<br>
				<br>
				Coming back to Oman, Fakhra worked for one year as an audit 
				assistant in an audit firm. Later, she joined MB petroleum as an 
				account and during the last five years climbed up the career 
				ladder to become the senior assistant accountant of the company. 
				Farkha, who when we met was about to quit the company to join 
				Oman Oil, said that her five-year stint in MB petroleum were 
				crucial in her development as a successful executive. <br>
				<br>
				Farkha finds pleasure in sharing her expertise with her junior 
				colleagues and newcomers and does her best to encourage and 
				support her team members. “I think each person should be 
				accountable to his or her company and to the society and country 
				as a whole. The more you give the more you get. I always share 
				this idea with my colleagues and always convince them the 
				importance of working as a family.<br>
				<br>
				Farkha who is doing her ACCA and wants to excel as the CFO of a 
				company in the future reminds Omani youth especially women about 
				the importance of having quality education and proper guidance 
				and training to succeed in life.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				</b><br>
				When he was a school boy, the child in Mohammed Ahmed Al Rahbi 
				could have been impressed by the respect and admiration his 
				teachers garnered not only from students but from across the 
				society. It was during this time that the desire to be a teacher 
				was etched in his mind, though the profession that destiny held 
				in store for him was that of a fund manager. But having guided a 
				number of Omani youngsters in Fincorp by giving them guidelines 
				to groom themselves and build up a successful career, Mohammed 
				thinks that he is doing his teaching job in a different, if not 
				more productive, way.<br>
				<br>
				An SQU graduate with Bachelor’s in accounting from the College 
				of Commerce and Economics, Mohammed started his career in 
				Fincrop in 2008 as an officer at asset management department. He 
				left the company as the assistant vice president in May 2011 to 
				join Oman National Investment Corporation Holding (ONIC 
				holding). Mohammed says that his three years in Fincrop were 
				instrumental in sharpening his skills and moulding his career as 
				an aspiring fund manager. During this time, he became efficient 
				in dealing with various finance related responsibilities and 
				developed his communication, leadership and decision making 
				skills. “Fincrop helped me a lot to grow and gave me exposure to 
				the functions of various areas in the financial sector. I was 
				part of Fincorp’s investment team which achieved the best 
				performance for mutual funds in Oman in 2009.” says Mohammed.<br>
				<br>
				Mohammed is very focused and ambitious about his career. He 
				wants to excel as a fund manager and aspires to be the managing 
				director of a big investment company in Oman in the next ten 
				years. Currently he is pursuing his MBA from the University of 
				Strathclyde, Glasgow in order to enhance his leadership and 
				management skills. He also spends his leisure time reading 
				management books. Besides, in the long run, he also dreams about 
				launch his own company.<br>
				<br>
				He feels that youngsters should be more consistent and 
				forward-looking. He warns them against setting short-term goals 
				and changing companies at regular intervals as it will adversely 
				affect their career objectives.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				Mubarak Al Nabhani, Control and Automation Engineer, Oman Gas 
				Company, warns against running after glamorous and lucrative 
				professions at the expense of skills <br>
				and interests</b><br>
				<br>
				It has been consistency, perseverance and dedication to work 
				that helped Naji Al Nabhani to build up a successful career in 
				control and automation engineering against many odds. He 
				believes that there is no dearth of opportunities in the country 
				for young Omanis to grow and excel as long as they are ready to 
				take up new challenges and responsibilities across the 
				industrial spectrum. Naji who started his career as a trainee 
				knows well that consistency and persistence will eventually pay 
				off. That is why he advises youngsters not to run after 
				glamorous and lucrative professions at the expense of their 
				calibre and interest. Concentration of young talent in a few 
				select professions is a cause of concern as it may lead to the 
				gradual disintegration of various other areas due to lack of 
				talented and a committed workforce.<br>
				<br>
				Having secured a Bachelor’s of Engineering in Electronics from 
				Caledonian College, Naji joined Tebodin Consultants and 
				Engineers as a trainee in 2003. After spending a couple of years 
				in various junior positions, he moved to TR Engineering in 2006 
				from where he resigned as Instrument Engineer to join Oman Gas 
				Company a couple of months ago. It was towards the end of his 
				stint in TR that Naji was nominated for BizPro awards and became 
				one of the 12 finalists. He also completed his Master’s in 
				Business Administration from Knowledge Horizon affiliated to the 
				University of Cambridge. A solid technical background and 
				management skills were greatly helpful for Naji to scale new 
				heights in his career. He believes that better time management, 
				technical expertise and communication skills were helpful for 
				him to emerge as a successful team leader.<br>
				<br>
				Backed by his string leadership and management skills, Naji 
				looks forward to securing some responsible and challenging 
				project management positions in future. In the long run, he also 
				plans to start a company in oil and gas consultancy because he 
				believes that his expertise and technical know-how in the same 
				field will assist him to run the business successfully. However, 
				he does not want to rush into starting a business all of a 
				sudden without necessary preparations and forethoughts. Naji 
				suggests that education system in Oman needs to be upgraded to 
				make it in tune with the new demands of the job market and to 
				keep pace with the changes going on world over. A footballer and 
				a frequent visitor to gyms, Naji says that physical health is a 
				prerequisite for mental health. He is also a calligraphy 
				hobbyist and plans to hold an exhibition of his calligraphic 
				works in the future.<hr color="#C0C0C0">

				rid of certain hangovers of the past is essential for pursuing a 
				successful profession and achieving success in life, says 
				Abdullah Ali Sarhan Al Reesi, Senior Projects Engineer, Al 
				Hassan Engineering Company</b><br>
				<br>
				Abdullah’s Al Reesi’s mantra of success is very simple: Since 
				there is no elevator to success, you have to take the stairs. He 
				firmly believes that to win without risk is to triumph without 
				glory; and that is why he considers consistency, sustainability 
				and persistence as the hallmarks of professional success. “If 
				you spend five years in five different companies, you will end 
				up virtually as a fresher without having any experience. These 
				days companies are looking for fresh engineering graduates to 
				cast them in their specific mould so that shifting companies in 
				short intervals will spoil one’s career prospects,” says 
				Abdullah. He advises young Omanis to be more focused and work 
				hard to have command and mastery of a specific field than 
				wasting time trying to become a jack of all trades. He also 
				urges them to get rid of certain hangovers of the past that 
				prevent them from pursuing professional success and govern their 
				attitude to work and commitment to responsibility.<br>
				<br>
				A graduate in chemical engineering from Sultan Qaboos University 
				(SQU), Abdullah started his career in Petroleum Development Oman 
				(PDO) as Petroleum Engineer in 2002. The industrial training he 
				obtained from various drilling and petroleum companies and 
				engineering institutions including in Germany as part of his 
				academic programme enabled him to start his career with great 
				confidence. He is currently pursuing his masters in petroleum 
				engineering on a part-time basis from SQU. After spending three 
				and a half years with PDO, Abdullah joined Oman Petrochemical 
				Industries Company (OPIC) to work for its projects in Sohar and 
				Fahud. But since the project did not get budgetary approval, the 
				company had to scupper the project halfway. This incident marked 
				a period of transition in Abdullah’s career as he decided to 
				switch over to construction and joined Al Hassan Engineering as 
				a senior project engineer, despite an opportunity to go back to 
				PDO. However Abdullah says it was not a complete change of 
				profession as construction engineering has much in common with 
				chemical engineering. During the last three and a half years, he 
				has completed four projects and has spent some months in the 
				estimation team.<br>
				<br>
				Abdullah presently leads a construction team at the site of a 
				petrochemical project in Adam. As Al Hassan is all set to 
				develop its own engineering section, Abdullah is looking forward 
				to playing a leading role in the new venture. As an ambitious 
				professional, he aspires to become a project manager within the 
				next five years and eyes a senior management position in the 
				long run. Himself a bibliophile, Abdullah takes special 
				interests in reading the works of Arab Booker laureates most 
				notably Tunisian novelist Ahlam Mostaghanemi.<br>

				The Middle East is slated to become a world-class producer and 
				distributor of iron ore pellets with the start of phase one of 
				operations in Vale’s $1.356bn pelletising plant and distribution 
				centre in Oman. Located in the coastal city of Sohar, the 
				Industrial Complex will serve as a hub catering to the growing 
				demand of iron ore products in the Middle East, North Africa and 
				India (MENAI).<br>
				<br>
				Vale’s Industrial Complex comprises a two-unit pelletising 
				plant, each with a nominal capacity of 4.5mn metric tonnes of 
				direct reduction pellets per year, in addition to a distribution 
				centre with an annual capacity of 40mn metric tons. In May 2010, 
				Vale entered into a strategic partnership with the Omani 
				government through the sale of a 30 per cent stake in the 
				pelletising company to Oman Oil Company.<br>
				“Sohar’s strategic location outside the Strait of Hormuz, with 
				the advantage of deep water seas, and the heavy infrastructure 
				investments to provide leading logistics networks, advanced 
				energy and power supply technologies and world-class facilities 
				at Sohar Industrial Port, were key to our decision to establish 
				our operations in the Sultanate,” says Roger Agnelli, Vale CEO.<br>
				<br>
				The visionary economic diversification plan adopted by the Omani 
				government will enable the establishment of a competitive steel 
				cluster that will be a vital component contributing to the 
				reduction in the 30mn metric tonnes supply-demand gap of 
				finished steel in the region. Vale’s project in Oman will create 
				a just-in-time operations framework to serve customers better 
				across MENAI. The company is committed to emerge as the largest 
				investor in the mining industry operating around the world with 
				a simple yet dynamic premise that there can be no future without 
				mining and there is no mining without caring about the future.<br>
				<br>
				Vale’s history is marked by a capacity for transformation and 
				has played an instrumental role in building a solid industrial 
				platform by positively contributing to the development of the 
				local economy. In line with this strategy, the company 
				contracted Sohar Industrial Port Company to build a 1.5km jetty 
				to be exclusively used and operated by Vale, which is scheduled 
				to be operational in June 2011. Three ship-loaders and one 
				ship-un-loader have already been delivered. A long-term 
				agreement was also signed with Oman Shipping Company for the 
				construction of four very large iron ore carriers (VLOCs) with a 
				loading capacity of 400,000 tonnes to be dedicated to Vale.<br>
				<br>
				Driven by its commitment to the sustainable development of the 
				Sultanate, Vale places high priority on developing and retaining 
				local qualified talents in the communities where it operates. To 
				date, the company has invested $11.3mn in specialised 
				recruitment and training programmes that aim to generate 720 
				direct and 1,800 indirect jobs.<br>
				<br>
				Vale considers the environment as a fundamental component of its 
				operations and seeks to balance environmental protection with 
				economic development. In Oman, the company continually invests 
				in managing environmental aspects and risks as well as research 
				new technology to surpass the established standards of 
				excellence in environmental control systems. A total of $40mn 
				has been invested in green technology which includes an advanced 
				100 per cent water recycling system as well as a 3,150-mtr wind 
				fence surrounding the industrial complex to control dust 
				emissions. Vale is also innovating the technology used for the 
				production of pellets, making its plant in Sohar the first to 
				use ‘Grate Kiln’ furnace. This technology will provide 
				consistent quality results and an end product with high 
				compression, low abrasion and perfect roundness. Headquartered 
				in Brazil, Vale operates in 38 countries on five continents.<br>

				highlights developments taking place in the Sultanate’s 
				utilities sector. An OER report<br>
				</span></b><br>
				<br>
				The first-ever Oman Power &amp; Water Summit held between May 22-25, 
				2011 put the spotlight on ongoing and upcoming projects to keep 
				the Sultanate’s power and water supply in pace with growing 
				demand as the country continues to experience rapid industrial 
				and economic development.<br>
				<br>
				The four-day event was held under the patronage of the Public 
				Authority for Electricity and Water (PAEW) and was officially 
				inaugurated by PAEW chairman HE Mohammed Abdullah Al-Mahrouqi. 
				The formal opening ceremony was attended by ministry officials, 
				diplomats, the top executives of companies, industry experts and 
				over 250 delegates representing many leading players in the 
				region’s power and water sector.<br>
				Organised by Global Exhibitions &amp; Conferences (GEC) and IQPC

				supported by the Ministry of Regional Municipalities and Water 
				Resources (MRMWR), Electricity Holding Company (EHC), Oman Power

				event with the strong presence of government authorities, public 
				and private sector companies, industry professionals and other 
				participants, all of whom play a major role in the continued 
				development of the sultanate’s vibrant power and water sector,”

				interactive workshops. The event’s conference programme covered 
				an extensive range of topics, including the potential of 
				renewable energy technologies in Oman, the government’s future 
				plans for the development of the country’s power and water 
				sector, sustainable management of the sultanate’s water 
				resources, strategies for improving power system capacity and 
				efficiency, and the importance of private sector participation 
				and investment in the industry.<br>
				<br>
				“The speakers chosen to discuss these topics are renowned 
				industry experts and highly influential personalities whose 
				vision and future decisions will be the main driving factors in 
				sustaining the industry continued growth,” said Rozenn Cornec, 
				conference director at IQPC Middle East. “Delegates of the Oman 
				Power &amp; Water Summit got the opportunity to not only be updated 
				on the latest developments in the industry but also got a full 
				sense of the range of prospects in this highly important 
				sector.”<br>

				GUtech, sustainability is an important issue and plays a major 
				role in all its programmes. Sustainable development is 
				development that meets the economic, social and environmental 
				needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
				generations to meet their own needs.<br>
				<br>
				After the success of last year’s Muscat Green Days Conference – 
				“Education for a Sustainably Built Environment” a second 
				conference on sustainable urban planning and sustainable tourism 
				issues will be held end of November this year at the Grand Hyatt 
				Muscat. GUtech university is keen on creating awareness and 
				promoting sustainable architecture and urban planning as well as 
				sustainable tourism in Oman - for the benefit of the economy of 
				the region, the environment and our future generations.<br>
				<br>
				The two-day conference will be organised by GUtech and Sesam 
				Consulting. Moreover, the university is an academic partner of 
				the conference. The chair for the conference is taken by Dr 
				Dieter Fuchs, general manager of the German Research Institute 
				Fraunhofer in the Middle East and President of the World 
				Association of Applied Research, WAITRO. <br>
				<br>
				During this year’s Muscat Green Days Conference a number of 
				GUtech projects, such as social housing projects, research on 
				sustainable urban planning patterns and the GUtech green campus 
				in Halban will be presented. <br>
				<br>
				The GUtech campus in Halban will be one of the first Green 
				building campuses in the Sultante. When the master plan was 
				developed, sustainability guidelines were worked out which 
				provide the basis for the design of single buildings. For 
				example, one detail is the green courtyards which are located in 
				front of all seminar and classrooms to create a comfortable 
				micro climate. Another aspect is the orientation of the 
				buildings considering the local climatic conditions such as 
				solar radiation, wind direction and others. Other green elements 
				are economising of natural resources, reuse of water and using 
				solar energy.<br>

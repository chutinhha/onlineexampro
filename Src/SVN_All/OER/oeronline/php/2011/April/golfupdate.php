				John Westwood had a later start at the game than many future 
				tournament professionals. He took up the game at the age of 13 
				after his grandparents bought him a half set of clubs, and less 
				than two years later, he was crowned junior champion of home 
				county Nottinghamshire.<br>
				<br>
				Lee won his first amateur event- the Peter McEvoy Trophy- in 
				1990, turned pro in 1993 after winning the British Youth 
				Championship and it’s been uphill from there. During his 
				successful career, Lee has won 18 events on the European Tour 
				and has also won tournaments in America, Africa, Asia and 
				Australia. His Official World Golf Ranking peaked at 4th, and in 
				2000 he won 7 tournaments worldwide and was ranked first on the 
				European Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s long run of 
				European Tour dominance.<br>
				<br>
				Westwood took a significant break from the game following the 
				birth of son Samuel Bevan in 2001, and together with a 
				restructuring of his swing under David Leadbetter. It led to him 
				being out of contention in tournaments until his 2003 victory in 
				Germany, his 25th worldwide. A regular on the Ryder Cup team, 
				Lee has played in the last six successive competitions. The year 
				2006 saw Lee further embellish his magnificent Ryder Cup record 
				when, for the second successive time, he remained unbeaten in 
				all five matches.<br>
				<br>
				Lee has enjoyed a spectacular return to form in 2007, winning 
				the Valle Romano Open de Andalucia and The Quinn Direct British 
				Masters, and is now the joint second most prolific English 
				winner with 18 European Tour titles to his name. Lee ended the 
				year finishing fourth at the Tiger Woods-hosted Target World 
				Challenge, featuring the world’s best golfers, and cemented his 
				place in Nick Faldo’s 2008 Ryder Cup team.<br>
				Born and bred in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Lee was presented 
				with Honorary degree of Doctor of Science on November 24, 2007 
				from Nottingham Trent.<br>
				<br>
				He is one of the few golfers who have won tournaments on every 
				major continent, including victories on the European Tour and 
				the PGA Tour. He was named player of the year in 1998, 2000, and 
				2009 seasons. He won the 2000 European Tour Order of Merit, and 
				the renamed 2009 Race to Dubai. He has represented Europe for 
				the last seven consecutive Ryder Cups. He spent over 180 weeks 
				in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings between 1998 
				and 2001and returned to the top 10 at the end of the 2008 season 
				and again after the 2009 PGA Championship.<br>
				<br>
				On 31st October 2010, Lee achieved number 1 spot in world 
				ranking and retained it for 17 weeks till 26 February 2011when 
				he was replaced by <i>Martin Kaymer.</i><br>

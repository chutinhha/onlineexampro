				<b>Royal Opera House opens<br>
				</b><br>
				His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said presided over the official 
				opening of the Royal Opera House Muscat in October. The iconic 
				opera house symbolises His Majesty’s personal interest in 
				developing the arts, heritage and culture of Oman.<br>
				<br>
				His Majesty the Sultan, on the occasion of the opening of the 
				Opera House, said, “Oman throughout its long history has played 
				prominent roles in various cultural fields and the time has come 
				now to cap that rich march by means of adopting concepts of 
				international culture and by effective contribution to its 
				promotion. Towards that end, we have established the Royal Opera 
				House Muscat as a centre of cultural radiation for the Omani 
				people and all humanity.<br>
				<br>
				The Royal Opera House will play a significant role in 
				disseminating world heritage and reinforcing the principles of 
				peace, co-existence and understanding among all nations and 
				peoples through art events that express a common human cultural 
				heritage of strong meaning and deep impact.<br>
				<br>
				Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot (tale of a frigid Chinese princess 
				named Turandot) was the first opera at the newly inaugurated ROH. 
				This opera was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, conducted by 
				Placido Domingo and performed by the Fondazione Arena di Verona 
				from Italy.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Revision of Budgetary numbers <br>
				</b><br>
				The government in April revised its General Budget for 2011 by 
				allocating RO1bn in additional funding towards employment 
				generation of almost 50,000 jobs, unemployment payouts, cost of 
				living allowances, and enhanced pension and social security 
				payouts, among other welfare benefits decreed by His Majesty 
				Sultan Qaboos bin Said.<br>
				<br>
				Around RO444mn has been earmarked to finance the recruitment of 
				40,714 Omani nationals in civil ministries as well as various 
				defence, security and related establishments. A further RO90mn 
				will go towards paying RO150 in monthly unemployment benefits to 
				an estimated 50,000 Omani job-seekers.<br>
				<br>
				The expanded budget also announces an outlay of RO43mn towards 
				meeting the 100 per cent in monthly pensions of social security 
				households. Higher monthly pensions for all retired civilians 
				and military personnel add a further RO89mn to government 
				expenditure. The cost of living allowance now payable to all 
				employees in military and civil establishments accounts for a 
				significant chunk of the additional funding allocated by the 
				government in fiscal 2011, said Minister Responsible for 
				Financial Affairs, HE Darwish bin Ismaeel al Balushi. At 
				RO251mn, it makes up roughly a fourth of the RO1bn in new 
				spending this year.<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, a sum of RO10mn has been earmarked towards 
				increasing the allowances of students enrolled in government 
				colleges, institutes and centres affiliated to the ministries of 
				Higher Education and Manpower.<br>
				<br>
				School bus operators providing transportation services to 
				students will also receive RO15mn in additional funding. Omanis 
				in the private sector stand to benefit from these allocations as 
				well. The revised budget earmarks RO25mn in meeting the cost of 
				paying increased pensions to nationals employed by the private 
				sector. Finally, grants totalling RO14mn have been set aside in 
				support of sporting and youth activities, as well as the 
				information sector.<br>
				<br>
				Al Balushi stressed that the RO1bn in additional funding will 
				largely come from oil revenues earned above the $58 per barrel 
				benchmark set by the government in formulating the 2011 State 
				Budget. As a result of the new financial commitments by the 
				government, public expenditure will burgeon to about RO9.1bn 
				during fiscal 2011, up from RO8.1bn announced in the State 
				Budget unveiled at the start of the year. Consequently, the 
				budget deficit is set to rise to RO1.9bn.<br>

				<b>Muscat named Arab Tourism Capital 2012<br>
				</b><br>
				The city of Muscat has been named as the Arab Tourism Capital 
				for 2012 by the Arab Tourism Ministers’ Council.Tourism Minister 
				HE Abdulmalik bin Abdullah Al Khalili said it was proof of the 
				status of this beautiful city on the Arab tourism map. He added 
				the sultanate would strive to make 2012 a ‘distinguished year’ 
				with a number of activities that highlight the vast tourism 
				potential of the country. HE Abdulmalik underlined the 
				importance of Oman’s rich natural environment and its ancient 
				civilisation and cultural heritage, in addition to several 
				tourism resorts that distinguish the Sultanate from the rest of 
				the countries of the region.<br>

				<br>
				The Port of Sohar’s new deepwater jetty was built at a cost 
				RO100mn to accommodate world’s largest bulk carriers at this 
				industrial port. Sohar Industrial Port Company (SIPC), the 
				landlord-operator of the industrial port constructed this 
				1,380-metre-long deepwater jetty, boasting drafts of 25 metres. 
				The first ship to call at the port was MV Bulk Asia, a 170,000 
				deadweight-tonne (DWT) Cape-size vessel carrying iron ore for 
				Jindal Shadeed Iron and Steel company. The deepwater jetty has a 
				capacity to handle the new generation of bulk carriers with 
				capacities equalling three times that of MV Bulk Asia. The 
				state-owned Oman Shipping Company (OSC) is currently building 
				four Ultra Large Ore Carriers (ULOCs), each of a staggering 
				400,000 tonnes capacity. <br>

				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				Perhaps the most defining moment in the political history of 
				Oman has been the empowerment of Majlis A’Shura with more 
				legislative and auditing powers in October 2011. His Majesty 
				Sultan Qaboos bin Said had promised more powers to the Shura 
				Council in the aftermath of the pro-reform protests in 
				February-March.<br>
				<br>
				A Royal Decree widened the powers of Majlis Oman and some 
				provisions of the Basic Law of the State allowing members of the 
				Majlis to take part in proposing laws and also suggesting 
				changes in government regulations. The 84-member Majlis A’Shura 
				which was elected in October was allowed to select its chairman 
				and speaker by a vote. The Council will also be able to question 
				the ministers. The chairman of Majlis was also made a part of a 
				core team that will be involved in choosing the successor to His 
				Majesty should there be any dispute in the Royal Family Council.<br>

				Vale Oman sets new benchmarks for steel<br>
				Oman entered a new stage in the steel industry as Vale 
				successfully began operations in its Industrial Complex at Sohar 
				Industrial Port in June. The company’s Pelletising Plant and 
				Distribution Centre aims primarily to transform iron ore into 
				pellets to cater to the growing demands of iron ore in the 
				Middle East, North Africa and India (MENAI). Vale Oman 
				Pelletising Company’s production capacity is designed to reach 
				18 million tones. Vale’s Industrial Complex in Sohar comprises a 
				two-unit pelletising plant, each with a nominal production 
				capacity of 4.5 million metric tonnes of direct reduction 
				pellets per year, in addition to a distribution centre with an 
				annual capacity of 40 million metric tonnes.<br>

				been placed by Oman Electricity Transmission Company (OETC) for 
				125MVA 132/33kV class transformers. The company’s new RO11mn 
				plant was inaugurated in the Sohar Industrial Estate by HH 
				Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq al Said in the presence of HE Sa’ad al 
				Saa’di, minister of Commerce and Industry, and W Y Lin, 
				president of Taiwanese technology partner Tatung. The plant has 
				the capability to produce and repair 315MVA 220kV class 
				transformers - the biggest in the region.<br>

				<b>Oman Drydock Company’s soft launch</b><br>
				<br>
				The Al Wusta Region of the Sultanate in May witnessed the launch 
				of the soft operations of the Oman Drydock Company in Duqm when 
				it received the first two vessels owned by a Belgian company for 
				maintenance. This augurs well in laying the strong pillars for a 
				new industrial development in the Sultanate namely the marine 
				industry.<br>
				<br>
				HE Said bin Hamdoon al Harthy, undersecretary of the Transport 
				and Communications, for Ports and Marine Affairs and chairman of 
				ODC said, “As of today, the government pumped more than RO700mn 
				of investments in the construction of the dry dock.” The drydock 
				will be ready by the end of August 2012 to receive all types of 
				commercial vessels of different sizes including oil tankers, 
				container vessel of the fourth and fifth generations and other 
				vessels with a capacity of 600,000 tonnes. <br>

				<b>SMN Power launches IPO</b><br>
				<br>
				SMN Power Holding launched its initial public offering (IPO) of 
				6,987,246 shares representing 35 per cent of the total share 
				capital in September. International Power is a founding 
				shareholder of SMN Power Holding, together with Mubadala 
				Development Company of Abu Dhabi and National Trading Company of 
				Oman. The only IPO in Oman in 2011, and one of the very few in 
				the region this year, the SMN Power Holding IPO attracted strong 
				interest from regional and international investors. The issue 
				was oversubscribed 1.7 times, raising RO40.9mn against the 
				target size of RO24.6mn. Following the IPO, 35 per cent of the 
				shares of SMN Power Holding will be held by public investors, 
				with the founder shareholders retaining the balance of 65 per 
				cent of the shares.<br>

				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				In October, the Ministry of Manpower effected significant 
				amendments to Oman’s labour law. As per the amendments, the 
				workers are entitled to two-day weekly off and not more than 45 
				hours of work per week. Any working hours above this should be 
				treated as overtime.<br>
				<br>
				The amendments also stipulates that salaries of employees should 
				be deposited in banks within 7 days of completion of a month. 
				The amendments also include the workers’ entitlement to a paid 
				annual leave of not less than 30 days in addition to a paid 
				emergency leave for six days during the year. HE Abdullah bin 
				Nasser al Bakri, Minister of Manpower, confirmed that the recent 
				amendments to the provisions of the Labour Law took into account 
				the interests of all parties involved in the process of 
				production, with a special focus on procedures that ensure a 
				healthy relationship between employers and employees.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Approval for Islamic Banking</b><br>
				<br>
				The Central Bank of Oman (CBO), in a landmark decision allowed 
				conventional banks operating in the Sultanate to offer Sharia-based 
				financial services – basically Islamic banking. HE Hamoud bin 
				Sangour al Zadjali, executive president of CBO stressed that the 
				imminent introduction of Islamic Banking services would help 
				support the country’s economic development. Oman offers a large 
				potential for the growth of Islamic banking in the future and it 
				is expected to to complement the conventional banking sector in 
				promoting the development of the economy. The CBO’s board of 
				governors had approved in May the inclusion of Islamic banking 
				in the provisions of the Omani Banking Law, in line with the 
				Royal Directives of His Majesty the Sultan. The apex bank also 
				approved the establishment of the country’s first Islamic bank – 
				Bank Nizwa – to provide banking services under the Sharia Law, 
				while another new bank, Al Izz International Bank, has been 
				authorised to offer Islamic banking services as well.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tourist port</b><br>
				<br>
				Port Sultan Qaboos located in the capital area of Muscat and one 
				of the three big ports in the country, will be converted from a 
				commercial port to a tourist port. All commercial, import, 
				export, general cargo and container activities will be 
				transferred to the Sohar Industrial Port.<br>
				<br>
				The commercial and tourist ports have major strategic importance 
				in sustainable development. The development of the port sector 
				will also enhance the ‘Oman Vision 2020’, which aims at 
				diversifying the resources of the national economy and reducing 
				reliance on oil revenues. Cruise shipping is expected to be the 
				mainstay of the converted port. In July, the Ministry of 
				Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Tourism issued 
				a joint statement that in coordination with the respective 
				public and private departments, the ministries will develop a 
				master plan and detailed designs for the port and its associated 
				services and utilities.<br>

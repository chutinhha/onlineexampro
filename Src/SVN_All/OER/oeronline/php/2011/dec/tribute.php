						The results of Dr Rajiha’s tireless efforts are there 
						for everyone to see. Oman’s name is now firmly stamped 
						on the world tourism map and the contribution of the 
						tourism sector to the GDP of Oman has exceeded the set 
						targets. Dr Rajiha’s death was an irreplaceable and 
						profound loss to the nation. Her dedication and 
						commitment to work was so remarkable that she continued 
						to discharge her ministerial duties even from her 
						hospital room till she died. She was also the 
						chairperson of Omran, the government organisation to 
						promote tourism and tourism integrated properties in 
						Oman. It was her foresight that led Oman to host the 4th 
						International Conference on Responsible Tourism 
						Destinations in Muscat in 2004. As many as 380 delegates

						into self-imposed exile during an uproar over nude 
						images of Hindu icons, Husain has been widely regarded 
						as the “Picasso of India” and has influenced a whole

						only the techniques of line and colour, but also those 
						of becoming a superstar of modern Indian art. Husain was 
						associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. A 
						dashing, eccentric figure who dressed in impeccably 
						tailored suits, he went barefoot and brandished an 
						extra-long paintbrush as a slim cane. He never 
						maintained a studio but spread his canvases out on the 
						floor of whatever hotel room he happened to be staying 
						in and paying for damages when he checked out. His 
						narrative paintings, executed in a modified Cubist 
						style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and 
						sombre. His themes—usually treated in series—include 
						topics as diverse as Mohandas K. Gandhi, Mother Teresa, 
						the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the British Raj, and 
						motifs of Indian urban and rural life.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

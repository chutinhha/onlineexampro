				One of the best public awareness campaigns in the Sultanate, 
				HSBC Oman’s Earth Hour 2011 instigates a shift in people’s 
				mindsets vis-à-vis their role in saving the planet<br>
				<br>
				HSBC Oman’s Earth Hour 2011 was an effective public awareness 
				campaign highlighting the importance of some simple measures in 
				our daily life in reducing energy consumption. The campaign 
				promoted public awareness on climate change by encouraging 
				students, customers, employees, and the local community to 
				reduce their energy consumption. Advocating a switch-over from 
				incandescent bulbs to energy saving bulbs, HSBC has distributed 
				over 8,000 complimentary energy saving bulbs to the public at 
				all its branches, to all its employees, and to 1,000 students in 
				two government schools in Muscat – Hassan Bin Thabit school for 
				boys and Wadi Al Kabeer School for girls. The switch to energy 
				saving bulbs is a sustainable solution as they would save up to 
				80 per cent energy and last up to six times longer than standard 
				incandescent bulbs. It has also encouraged switching off the 
				lights for 60 minutes during Earth Hour. The HSBC employees were 
				equally engaged in the campaign, volunteering their time to 
				deliver environmental awareness presentations at the schools. 
				The feedback was very much positive as it generated more demand 
				from the public for energy saving bulbs and could instigate a 
				shift in people’s mindsets vis-à-vis their role in saving the 
				planet.<br>

				Symbolically led by an Arabian Oryx named Noor (light), 
				Electricity Holding Company’s Save Energy Oman is a national 
				campaign calling for a change to the way we use electricity<br>
				<br>
				Electricity Holding Company’s Save Energy Oman is a national 
				campaign to spread awareness among individual and corporate 
				consumers of electricity across the Sultanate on the importance 
				of reducing energy consumption, especially during peak summer 
				times. A cartoon character named after Noor, a white Arabian 
				Oryx found in the Arabian and Omani desert, was made the 
				campaign’s ambassador. The choice of ‘Noor’ was not only because 
				she is Omani and looks beautiful but also owing to the fact that 
				The Arabian Oryx is preserved by the Omani government. The 
				company’s brochures, sunshades and other branded materials for 
				the campaign were distributed both in Muscat and beyond. The 
				company also received paintings of “Noor” from School children 
				who illustrated her switching off electricity or giving advice 
				on saving energy. The campaign’s message along with Noor’s 
				picture was also portrayed on ARAMEX vans which travel across 
				the country for deliveries so that it can be disseminated among 
				a large number of people. The company has also kept a pledge 
				book specifically for the campaign. The campaign won a 
				prestigious award in the UK for being the number one “Cause 
				Related Marketing Campaign” as part of the UK’s Annual “Drum 
				Marketing Awards”. <br>

				<b>A green department</b><br>
				Renaissance Service’s Office Green Team (OGT) has served as a 
				‘green department’ spreading the green awareness message to all 
				levels of the company<br>
				<br>
				The Office Green Team (OGT) of Renaissance Service is aimed at 
				setting up a central department in each subsidiary to document 
				green activities at various locations and to share that 
				information with the management, colleagues and the 
				headquarters. The OGT could inspire employee action and 
				awareness and document the green activities that were taking 
				place at various multinational locations of the company and 
				share the information with other green teams. As part of the 
				initiative, literature and reviews of eco-conferences have been 
				shared across the company subsidiaries, and presentations were 
				delivered to the OGT and business heads, motivating companies to 
				develop green agendas and individuals to actively organise 
				recycling initiatives. The OGT is a voluntary team and its 
				members are nominated for a period of three months. The meetings 
				are scheduled weekly, and each OGT sets a short term agenda and 
				presents it to the upper management for approval. It has served 
				as a ‘green department’ meant to actively spread the green 
				awareness message to all levels of the company. Besides OGT, the 
				company has also spearheaded a paper and plastic recycling 
				initiative at the corporate office. Up to 45 kilos of paper is 
				collected each week from offices and goes straight to recycling. 
				Both the OGT and paper recycling programmes are sustainable in 
				that they don’t require many resources and positively contribute 
				to a better world with little consumption of resource. The 
				meetings are conducted in natural light, and notes are taken on 
				the back sides of used papers.<br>

				Green Cover has introduced eco-friendly infill materials in 
				artificial grass at Bel Raimaitha Club Stadium in Dubai<br>
				<br>
				In an effort to explore the possibility of eco-friendly stadiums 
				in the Middle East, Green Cover has introduced natural infill 
				materials in artificial grass instead of chemical materials at 
				Bel Raimaitha Club Stadium in Dubai. The natural infill product 
				has become the most favoured infill for football fields across 
				the region. The composition of this product revolutionises the 
				infill method for an artificial turf field. Thanks to this 
				product, the stadium always looks fresh and tidy and imparts an 
				eco-friendly feeling to the players. There is no smell of rubber 
				in the hot climate. The project is cost-effective as it is not 
				labour-oriented and no water or fertiliser <br>
				is required.<br>
				<br>
				Besides, quality and stability is assured. Weekly moistening of 
				the infill will expand its life time up to 15 to 20 years. This 
				natural infill can be recycled for agricultural use when the 
				artificial turf comes to the end of its life. As an organic 
				infill of plant origin, it is odourless and microorganism proof. 
				It has characteristics to keep the median temperature of the 
				synthetic turf lower than a rubber infill, very much like a 
				natural grass temperature. The company is looking at doing the 
				same in Oman by educating people about carbon emissions and 
				cultivating a green culture. <br>

				The Caledonian College of Engineering has incorporated 
				environmental awareness in its mission for creating a clean and 
				green academic culture with focus on reducing the use of paper, 
				encouraging recycling, saving energy and water and developing 
				renewable energy. The college has set up an energy efficiency 
				team to implement and monitor energy efficiency concepts within 
				the campus. Posters indicating energy and water saving messages 
				were displayed all over the campus to create awareness among 
				students and staff members. Other important measures include 
				digitisation of the records, introduction of paper-cut software 
				in all PCs and solar lighting at certain places inside the 
				college, appointment of a company for recycling papers and 
				plastic and other materials, replacement of some halogen flood 
				lights with LED floodlights and planting trees and shrubs 
				wherever possible all across the campus.<br>
				<br>
				The college has undertaken a number of research projects on 
				solar energy applications for water treatment, desalination, 
				power generation, water pumping, solid waste management etc.It 
				also organises international and regional conferences on 
				renewable energy to create a platform for discussing and 
				brainstorming innovative and creative ideas on green concepts 
				and student competitions to extract creative ideas from young

				Grade 5 students at ABA-An IB World School have carried out a 
				3-month long scientific investigation and research to understand 
				some of the vexing environmental issues of our time<br>
				<br>
				ABA-An IB World School’s ‘Grade 5 Exhibition: Sharing the 
				Planet’ was the result of a 3-month long investigation in which 
				students were able to inquire and learn about various 
				environment problems. They carried out scientific 
				investigations, research, and action to better understand and to 
				educate others about environmental issues. They could learn the 
				causes and effects of the problems and investigate the 
				solutions. The findings were presented to the public through 
				books, power point presentations and movies which were all done 
				by the students themselves. There were songs, dances, skits, 
				talk shows and games shows, each showing the problems the 
				environment is facing along with the solutions to these 
				problems. It has also encouraged other students to adopt more 
				sustainable practices at home and school. By placing the 
				responsibility on the students to first learn about the issues 
				and then present it to the community, the project enabled the 
				students to gain ownership of the ideas. When students are 
				directly connected and responsible for their education they tend 
				to retain information and change their habits. ABA has 
				incorporated environmental education into the curriculum. By 
				changing daily habits and raising awareness in the school 
				community, the school seeks to adopt more sustainable practices 
				in water, electricity, and paper consumption. The school also 
				aims to reduce its consumption of water, electricity and paper 
				as well as encourage good environmental practices.<br>

				<br>
				Haya Water has set up its Composting Plant in Al Amerat to reuse 
				sewage sludge (Biosolids) and convert them to Compost, thereby 
				contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The entire 
				sewage sludge generated by Haya Water sewage treatment plants is 
				currently composted at the plant instead of dumping them at the 
				landfill, which will cause the formation of greenhouse gases, 
				mainly methane gas. The plant has motivated others to deliver

				environment in general and the quality of underground water in 
				particular. <br>
				<br>
				The “Open Agitated Window System” technology used in the plant 
				is not only the best option for a country with plenty of 
				sunshine but also it allows the use of different wastes as a raw 
				material. The plant has branded its product as ‘Kala Compost’ 
				and sells it to generate income which will contribute to the 
				sustainability of the project. The use of Kala Compost – which 
				complies with standards of the Ministry of Environment, GCC and 
				USEPA – by farmers, landscaping contractors and home gardeners

				In an attempt to give a green hue to the workplaces by reducing 
				carbon footprint, COWI Oman has set up a baseline for its Oman 
				office<br>
				<br>
				COWI Oman’s Carbon Footprint Initiative seeks to reduce the 
				overall carbon footprint of Oman’s construction industry. The 
				company has adopted a multidimensional approach aimed at 
				reducing carbon footprint at its workplace and offering climate 
				solutions to all clients. It has established a baseline 
				footprint for its Oman office to measure the annual changes. In 
				addition, there are direct measurements of power consumption, 
				waste production and vehicle use. Though the idea of setting up 
				a visible and meaningful baseline involves an element of risk, 
				COWI international has taken up the challenge and now promotes 
				these activities in its other offices globally. The company has 
				achieved improvements, albeit limited, in power and water 
				consumption. The announcement of the actual figure of carbon 
				emission for 2009 has generated significant interest among the 
				staff members who decided to meet regularly to discuss the means 
				of reducing office and industry footprint. The momentum has 
				spread to the point where COWI management has decided to move 
				offices to more energy efficient premises. The decision to move 
				the offices, despite being an expensive one, reflected the 
				company’s commitment to climate solutions. Other activities 
				initiated by COWI includes visiting schools to promote carbon 
				footprint calculation, developing own expertise in low energy 
				solutions and making business communication techniques <br>
				more efficient.<br>

				<br>
				The new head office of BankMuscat in Seeb has turned out to be 
				an architectural masterpiece and an outstanding landmark in 
				terms of aesthetics and facilities. Designed in accordance with 
				the highest environmental standards, the building redefines 
				modern banking requirements in terms of functionality, security, 
				productivity and business continuity. All timber products 
				required for the building were taken from a sustainable source.<br>
				<br>
				While designing the eastern and western elevations of the 
				building, due consideration was given to the installation of 
				simple windows for protection from heat. Imported Pilkington 
				glass, which is one of the most environment friendly varieties 
				of glass, was used. The Oriel windows of the building reflect 
				the Omani architectural style blended with traditional Islamic 
				architecture. Imported Pilkington glass used for the 
				construction is one of the most advanced and environment 
				friendly types available. Two key air handling units have been 
				strategically placed to minimise greenhouse effects; and the 
				building is fitted with sensor-based lighting devices to reduce 
				or increase lighting in order to conserve energy. When sunshine 
				is at its peak, the lighting system automatically remains dim. 
				Sensor taps and other latest sanitary fixtures have been used to 
				minimise water wastage. Another attraction of the building is a 
				Moroccan-style garden. Having successfully pushed architectural 
				boundaries, the new BankMuscat headquarters is sure to stand the

				Port of Salalah’s auto cut-off system for flood lights helped it

				<br>
				At most ports, during normal operations the floodlights of quay 
				cranes at the boom and operator cabin are usually switched on. 
				However, after the operations end and the quay cranes are in 
				idle mode, floodlights remain on until someone switches them off 
				manually leading to wastage of power during the idle time of 
				quay cranes. To address this, Port of Salalah has introduced an 
				auto cut-off system for flood lights under the Flood Light 
				project. The project helped the company to save 10 per cent of 
				the total Quay Cranes energy consumption in 2010. Apart from 
				this the port has hired an environment consultant to measure and 
				reduce its Co2 emission levels. It has implemented more than 17 
				environment related initiatives and it monitors environmental 
				improvements and ongoing projects. <br>
				The port monitors the improvements of the ongoing projects every 
				month and regular updates are provided to the management team. 
				It constantly reviews the plans, compares it with other ports 
				and shares it with the community through joint projects and 
				education. All projects include continual measurement and 
				improvement. The port is also engaged in a socioeconomic study 
				to understand the impact on the environment. Besides, the port 
				is the first company in Oman to start Carbon Credit trading. It

				dependence on external water by recovering process water for 
				reuse in its concentrator<br>
				<br>
				Mawarid Mining’s Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) was prepared 
				for storing tailings from its Lasail Copper concentrator. It was 
				mainly aimed at reducing dependence on external water resources 
				as much as possible and preventing water table contamination. 
				The mining company had a dedicated team of engineers, 
				environmental specialists and hydrological consultants working 
				on this project. The team looked at the best design where 
				minimum energy consumption is required. A water decant system 
				was applied to make use of gravitational force to drive 
				segregated water outside the dam into the return water ponds. 
				Moreover, all samples were tested on a regular basis to verify 
				there was no contamination of underground water.<br>
				<br>
				Located at a suitable site that minimises potentially negative 
				impacts, the TSF is lined with a 2 &amp; 1.5 mm thick HDPE liner to 
				prevent seepage of process water into the ground. Tailings dam 
				is monitored on a monthly basis and a fence is installed around 
				to prevent entry of man and animals. Vegetation will be applied 
				on the top of the tailing and it is expected that further 
				seeding of vegetation cover will occur naturally from nearby 
				grasses. Monitoring will continue until water samples meet the 
				required standards. The TSF has become a motivation hub for 
				school students in the region educating them about the 
				importance of the environment and water conservation.<br>

				The Voraxial Technology introduced by Al Abrar Petrogas has 
				significantly contributed to combat oil spillage and treat 
				contaminated water<br>
				<br>
				Al Abrar Petrogas has introduced Voraxial Technology as an 
				innovative solution for recovering oil from oil spills and 
				produced water used by oil producing companies. The use of this 
				technology will protect water resources, ground water and sea 
				water from contamination. It was tested during the Gulf of 
				Mexico spillage and the results surprised many people. The 
				technology will also help oil producers and refineries which 
				dump produced water or waster into Oman Sea to treat such wastes 
				and meet environment standards. It will be of great importance 
				to dry dock ports where there are a lot of oil spills by ships 
				which come for services. This technology will be able to treat 
				the water and recover the oil and return the clean water back to 
				the sea. Voraxial Technology also helps in reducing CO2 
				emissions as it uses less power and energy.<br>
				<br>
				The Voraxial is efficient as a liquid/liquid, liquid/solid or 
				liquid/liquid/solid separator. The Voraxial Separator is a 
				compact, 2-way or 3-way separator that is able to process large 
				volume of liquids with a small footprint and without any 
				pressure loss. The Voraxial produces a high centrifugal force 
				and generates a vortex to separate a mixture of fluids or a 
				combination of fluids and solids by their different densities. 
				The heavier elements are drawn to the outside of the vortex 
				while the lighter materials are drawn toward the centre, forming 
				the central core of the vortex. A specially designed manifold is 
				utilised at the exit of the separation chamber to collect the 
				separated streams.<br>

				Salalah Beach Project of Muriya Tourism Development has emerged 
				as a role model for eco-friendly landscape and tourist 
				destinations in Oman<br>
				<br>
				Designed as a ‘Salalah Coastal Zone Tourism Development’, Muriya 
				Tourism Development Company’s Salalah Beach Project is a 
				nature-dependent tourist facility in Oman meeting all 
				eco-friendly landscape principles. The project makes use of open 
				spaces, through a master plan which incorporates a beach, Khwars 
				or wetlands, lagoons and a golf course. Its eco-friendly 
				landscape breaks the density of development by providing an 
				overall landscape view, water frontage and recreational 
				activities. The project has been designed to have a minimal 
				visual impact on populated areas of Dhofar. Low density building 
				and infrastructure design minimises adverse environmental 
				impacts. Overall this beach project has emerged as a role model 
				for eco-friendly landscape and tourist destinations in Oman. <br>
				The project is aimed at designing a plan for the sustainability 
				and environmental protection of Dhofar region in order to 
				mitigate the environmental impact. A preliminary environmental 
				impact assessment (EIA) was undertaken to determine the 
				potential generic environmental impact and possible mitigation 
				measures for the construction, operation and maintenance of the 
				proposed development. Based on the environmental setting and 
				sensitivities of the proposed development area, alternative 
				master plans were developed and assessed from an environmental 
				perspective. As many as 950 coconut trees were planted for the 
				project so far and 2,050 more will be planted in the future. 
				Besides, when the project will be completed around 1,000,000m2 
				will be covered by green grass for the golf area.<br>

				By implementing an effective water management technology, Sultan 
				Qaboos University has reduced its annual water consumption for 
				irrigation by 25 per cent<br>
				<br>
				Central Control System for Irrigation Water Management at Sultan 
				Qaboos University has effectively employed water management 
				technology for the maintenance of its large landscape area by 
				utilising available water and energy resources. The University’s 
				technical team worked in association with two manufacturers of 
				the best water management technical expertise – Rain Bird 
				International (USA) along with their local distributor Al Ansari 
				Trading Enterprise, and Hunter Industries Incorporated (USA) 
				with their local distributor Muna Noor Manufacturing and Trading 
				– to design an effective water management technology. <br>
				In the first five months from the actual date of operation, 
				water consumption has reduced by 25 per cent compared to the 
				same period in the previous year. In addition, the new 
				technology contributed to reduce ground water table depletion 
				around SQU, prevent the deterioration of water quality, and 
				increases the life of irrigation equipment like pumps, 
				controllers, rotors, etc.The effective implementation of water 
				saving technology has impressed the local distributor and it has 
				become a role model for various government and private sector 
				organisations which are interested in implementing technologies 
				that conserve natural resources. The success of this project has 
				prompted many people and organisations to modify their existing 
				method of irrigation applying the effective central control 
				system which will bring them the ultimate benefit of water 
				saving and effective utilisation of available natural resources.<br>

				greatly assisted Oman to emerge as a destination for culture, 
				heritage and nature. In 2010, the Ministry initiated a wide 
				range of inter-connected initiatives to elevate the industry and 
				held discussions on the benefits of sustainable and responsible 
				tourism. As the government’s lead agency for the destination 
				marketing of Oman, the Ministry has reviewed and refined Oman’s 
				brand positioning to give greater priority to nature and natural 
				values. This included a review of messaging and images to better 
				communicate Oman’s natural values to consumer segments as well 
				as to Omanis. Nature was a core theme of the Ministry-sponsored 
				photographic competition which was designed to excite Oman’s 
				photographers to take images that could market Oman to the 
				world, and educate the community on the value of tourism and the 
				environment. In October 2011, the Ministry will host the third 
				International Geotourism Conference to build awareness about 
				Oman’s natural values at an international level and provide an

				The Ministry of Agriculture has proved how treated wastewater 
				can be used for growing seasonal forage crops like sorghum,

				<br>
				The Ministry of Agriculture – Directorate General of 
				Agricultural &amp; Livestock Research – has explored how effectively 
				non-conventional water resources can be utilised for agriculture 
				production. The Directorate has studied the use of treated 
				wastewater for producing seasonal forage crops like sorghum, 
				maize and barley in Saham. The idea came to fruition when the 
				regional municipality agreed to provide treated wastewater and 
				farmers in the area showed a keen interest to cultivate such 
				crops. The project has turned out to be a remarkable success 
				with the new method enhancing productivity and reducing the 
				pressure on ground water resources considerably. Sorghum crop 
				was most profitable. Farms which were degraded due to drought or 
				salinity can now be rehabilitated in Batinah and other regions.<br>
				<br>
				The cultivation of fodder by using treated wastewater is likely 
				to boost green land development across the country. This will 
				have a favourable socioeconomic impact due to high crop yield. 
				The experiment points to the necessity of developing new 
				possibilities for reusing treated wastewater for irrigation,

				A low-cost- low maintenance water treatment system developed by 
				Sultan Qaboos University will be helpful in treating ablution 
				water in mosques in order to reuse them for irrigation<br>
				<br>
				Sultan Qaboos University’s Department of Soils, Water and 
				Agricultural Engineering has designed a low-cost-low-maintenance 
				treatment system to collect, treat and reuse ablution water from 
				small to medium size mosques. The department has designed and 
				constructed a water treatment system for a selected community 
				mosque after studying the quantity and quality of the ablution 
				water there. The treated water samples tested as a part of this 
				project were found to meet all Omani standards for irrigation 
				water. Treated ablution water was reused to irrigate grass and 
				trees around the mosque.<br>
				<br>
				The system reduces the use of fresh municipality water and the 
				pressure on the sewage treatment network or local septic tanks. 
				The risks of soil and ground water contaminations as a result of 
				septic tank leaks at small community mosques are also 
				considerably reduced. The Ministry of Regional Municipalities 
				and Water Resources has installed a similar unit at Abu-Hamzaa 
				Al-Shaari mosque in Al-Hail South, Seeb. The structure of 
				treatment unit is relatively very simple and easy to maintain. 
				This is because of the use of locally available materials such 
				as a water storage tank and washed beach sand in its 
				construction. There are more than 13,000 community mosques in 
				Oman where a large quantity of fresh water is being used for 
				ablution. With this low cost- low maintenance ablution water 
				treatment system this water can be re-used to irrigate grass and 
				trees around the mosques.<br>

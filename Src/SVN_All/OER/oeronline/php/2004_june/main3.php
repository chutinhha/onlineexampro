            built behemoths that rode as smooth as silk in a straight line<img border="0" src="imo.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="250" height="140"> 
            but succumbed to the physics of their weight and dimensions, when 
            faced with sinuosity. This didn't matter so much because they were 
            status symbols designed to carry you through metropolitan traffic 
            cocooned from reality, then on to the open highways comfortably 
            cruising at over 100mph only to finish on a long gravel drive up to 
            a manor house. The smell and feel of the hide, the magnificent 
            carving of exotic woods and carpets so plush you could loose a small 
            pet in them were de rigueur. <br>
            <br>
            However, in the 21st century, opulent finishes are no longer enough; 
            our fascination with technology has made us far more demanding. This 
            attitude of wanting it all, the greatest technology dressed in the 
            finest accoutrement has existed for much longer in the exclusive 
            world of watchmakers. Connoisseurs of fine timepieces will argue 
            that no matter how skilled a jeweller is at embellishing the casing 
            of a timepiece, the picture will never be complete unless the 
            movement inside is a marvel of mechanics and miniaturisation. Such 
            connoisseurs will scoff at jewellers who have transformed themselves 
            into watchmakers arguing that a truly great timepiece must strive 
            for perfection from the inside out. <br>
            <br>
            Given the global trend of consolidation in which exclusive luxury 
            marques are being swallowed by mass producing global giants, in a 
            world of ever larger corporations where the US of A may conceivably 
            be superseded by the UC of E (United Corporations of Earth), 
            compromises have been made in the name of profits. But not here, at 
            the very summit of automobile exclusivity, where customers put down 
            deposits before they know how much their car is going to cost. <br>
            <br>
            There is a place... a place where Bentley's Continental GT was born. A 
            car with a distinguished and a thoroughbred lineage, where speed and 
            comfort were not mutually exclusive... A place... Enough flowery talk of 
            how it all came to be, let's get down to business. I know that after 
            a half hour introduction in the showroom, I was itching to become 
            one of the first people in the Middle East to test drive this 
            fascinating new car. <br>
            <br>
            I was handed the keys, which I dropped in my pocket as I sat behind 
            the wheel. One foot on the brake and one finger on the starter 
            switch and the GT awoke with a tenorous roar. The deep bass sound 
            that emanated from the car at idle may attract many more successful 
            rap artists to this legendary name. (Will Smith and P Diddy have 
            written their Bentleys into the lyrics of their platinum selling 
            albums and started a veritable trend among rap stars.) <br>
            <br>
            <b>Sound system </b><br>
            The GT's growl is so low pitch yet loud that you find yourself 
            giving the accelerator pedal little half-inch kicks that make the 
            car shift down and jump up a few octaves. Then, seconds later, when 
            the computer figures out you aren't planning to really do anything, 
            it shifts back up to low grumble mode. In short, if you are a real 
            poser and you feel the looks of this Bentley are a little too 
            understated, you can always get people's attention by playing tunes 
            on the W12 (the name given to the power plant). You can't really 
            hear any of the higher pitch sounds because by then you are going so 
            fast they have all been swept away (unless you are in a tunnel). <br>
            <br>
            Pull the gear lever back to D then S (for Sport, I assume) and the 
            handbrake automatically disengages as you pull away. Unfortunately, 
            I was going to sit in traffic for a while before reaching a nearby 
            mountain playground of two- to four-lane ecstasies. Five hundred and 
            fifty ponies and 650 Nm of torque gnashing at the bit, but nowhere 
            to go. When I finally did get to the first stretch of open road (the 
            climb toward Al Bustan Palace) I didn't give in to the temptation of 
            simply flooring it, instead I gradually unleashed power in a manner 
            more akin to what I imagined a typical Bentley driver to be. <br>
            <br>
            The one thing I immediately noticed was this car's ability to mask 
            true speed. This is the ideal car for gentlemen with cautious wives 
            who protest when faced with the boyish tendencies of their husbands 
            to be seduced by the thrill of speed. Indeed, the GT at 200k is as 
            composed as most cars are at the speed limit. Back to the test 
            drive, and we have forked to the right and are now climbing the 
            Qantab road. It's four lanes wide and climbs steeply while curving 
            left then right with no repose. I have switched the suspension from 
            level 1 (comfort) to level 4 (sport) using the large circular dial 
            below the LCD. The GT doesn't loose its composure as it climbs 
            through the S curve. Beneath the immaculate wood and hide, there is 
            a flurry of activity. Three computer controlled systems are working 
            simultaneously; a four-wheel drive system that distributes power to 
            wherever it is most needed, a traction control system that rations 
            power when rubber threatens to loose grip and an active suspension 
            that manages that impeccable composure. The 550 horsepower twin 
            turbo power plant delivers power very smoothly. In fact, I could 
            hardly feel the turbochargers at all. There is no violent power at 
            all unless you manually select a low gear and initiate the violence 
            yourself by kicking the pedal mercilessly. Taking the GT around a 
            roundabout while pushing it, deliberately trying to unsettle it 
            produces mainly a lot of tyre screeching. <br>
            <br>
            The traction control takes this 2.5 tonne ultra luxury sports car 
            around corners both assertively and comfortably. I would love to 
            know what it would feel like if one could shed a tonne-and-a-half of 
            weight at this point. However, I am certain that a lighter composite 
            version of this type of car just wouldn't have the same solid feel 
            and if you did loose control hitting the curb, it would be a lot 
            more violent if you were at the wheel of a lighter car. <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile in the cabin, my senses aren't picking up anything more 
            than the new car smell and the bass rumblings of the exhaust system. 
            As the road straightens out, I drop the windows, one of my favourite 
            details here is the total lack of B pillars making the side window 
            stretch the full length of the cabin. This neatly brings me to the 
            back seats, which surprisingly are perfectly acceptable for a 2x2. 
            Before setting off, I deliberately jumped in the back seat after 
            adjusting the driver's seat to my liking and, surprisingly I had 
            space for my legs. This was even more surprising when I popped the 
            trunk open and saw a deep (370 litre) cavity. <br>
            <br>
            But it is the opposite end of the GT that is of real interest - for, 
            here beats the heart of the beast, a very compact V12 or, more 
            precisely, W12. Your first glance beneath the hood can be exciting 
            or disappointing depending on your nature. Like many high-end German 
            power plants, the engine compartment is stark matte black plastic 
            with a neat little medallion of engine protruding in the middle with 
            all the more impressive performance statistics engraved in clear 
            sigh, lest you get asked the question by an envious friend whom you 
            are giving the grand tour. <br>
            <br>
            Needless to say, there are no user serviceable parts under here. But 
            then again, how many Bentley owners spend their weekends under their 
            cars tinkering? If, however, you do find yourself riffling through 
            the glove compartment for the owner's manual, don't bother. Simply 
            press the help button below the LCD screen and search the index 
            digitally. Unless, of course, the nature of your problem is 
            electric, in which case you will have to revert from software back 
            to treeware! <br>
            <br>
            The GT has a curious shape as if it prematurely made it off the 
            prototype pages of designers, it has a futuristic feel of 
            simplicity. Its leading edge resembles a cross between an Audi TT 
            and an 'S' type Jag after inserting a signature Bentley grille. The 
            cabin space is once again reminiscent of the TT due to its long low 
            windows that wrap around the passengers at eye level. Being a much 
            bigger car than the TT, it loses the overly rounded feel and 
            stretches out gracefully but without excessive overhang at the 
            extremities. <br>
            <br>
            In an ever-so-subtle salute to nostalgia, the designers have 
            included an old-fashioned<img border="0" src="xsl.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="250" height="155"> 
            teardrop flare around the rear wheel arches. Its predecessors like 
            the 1952 Bentley R continental... (pictured above) had the front and 
            rear wheels framed by these bulbous tear shaped fenders with 
            elongated tails. Today's GT traces of these features embossed on its 
            side like an old crest on a new blazer. The rear end tapers slightly 
            and is as trademark 'Bentley' as the mesh grille. E=mc2 Revised 
            Einstein's theory of relativity states that the faster an object 
            travels, the larger it becomes. This object is faster than any of 
            its predecessors, yet smaller too. Once inside Bentley, connoisseurs 
            will feel right at home although it's a much more snug fit. The 
            steering wheel seems rather large in this setting with its 
            pillow-size airbag (I wonder if it is softer than in other cars). 
            All the important controls surround the airbag on the wheel. Behind 
            the steering are hidden F1 style paddles for gear shifting a la 
            tiptronic like in every other car that has these. I still feel it is 
            a gimmick. They were fun to use de-accelerating on the approach to 
            the Bustan roundabout after the long downhill. <br>
            <br>
            Back to the cabin... where the seats are now in massage mode and I 
            notice four empty drink holders built into the central tunnel, which 
            runs from the dash to the gear lever under my armrest between the 
            two back seats and up to the rear shelf. Personally, I never have 
            been a big fan of split rear seats; it limits the versatility of the 
            space at the back and doesn't allow you to sprawl across the rear 
            seats on a long voyage. Built into the console between the rear 
            seats is an arm rest and a hatch that leads into the trunk. This 
            allows you to pass your skis through the boot between the seats and 
            up to the drivers elbow. Please send in your suggestions as to what 
            this could be used for in our part of the world. Perhaps the 
            caterers could ride in the boot and pass you snacks? <br>
            <br>
            Jokes aside, this car has taken Bentley into the 21st century 
            without leaving behind the core values of the founders. This has 
            been made possible by splicing advanced German automotive technology 
            with a coachbuilder's dedication to his craft and independence from 
            Rolls Royce hasn't hurt either. Yes, it is genetically modified, but 
            I can't see any scary side effects. In summary, Bentley's latest 
            creation is original, subtle, compact, powerful (subtly). It sounds 
            fantastic and delivers in all departments where a GT is expected to 
            deliver. Grace and athleticism in a package labelled 'M' rather than 
            'XL' and beauty... I leave to the eye of the beholder. n</font></p>

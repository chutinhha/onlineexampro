            <br>
            Putting Customers First by Andy Bruce &amp; Ken Langdon is a good 
            handbook for beginners in the field of Sales. No business can deny 
            how important each and every customer is to his/her business. I 
            remember a quote from Sir Sam Walton, the founder of the retail 
            giant Wal-Mart in the US. &quot;The customer is your only boss, it is he 
            who can fire a managing director to a sales executive by spending 
            his money with someone else.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            This book contains 101 steps towards improving your &quot;customer first' 
            skills. The contents in the book are rightly layered and supported 
            with illustrations. It also contains a questionnaire to assess the 
            &quot;customer first' skills of an executive. Experienced executives will 
            find this book basic since it covers the core fundamentals of 
            selling being applied by them on a day-to-day basis; nevertheless, 
            it is a good ready reckoner. <br>
            <img border="0" src="lanm.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="130"><br>
            One interesting aspect discussed in this book is about how to apply 
            the &quot;customer first' principles within organisations across their 
            departments by treating them exactly like customers. I am sure when 
            any executive looks at it from this perspective, the theory of 
            customer satisfaction and the need to find solutions for all 
            inter-departmental issues / hurdles start making more sense. This 
            book will be more useful for<br>
&nbsp;executives in a B2B 
            (Business-to-Business) model - i.e., corporate business dealings, 
            while it can be a refresher for executives in the B2C 
            (Business-to-Consumer) model - i.e., Retail.

            Shackleton's Way is great read full of philosophic leadership 
            lessons from the 20th Century's greatest unsung hero. In 1914, Sir 
            Ernest Shackleton led 27 men, for almost 2 years, through a 
            harrowing fight for their lives after the wreck of their Antarctic 
            vessel, Endurance, left them stranded on an ice floe twelve hundred 
            miles from civilisation. However, every man survived and every man 
            ascribed it to Shackleton's superb leadership. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="ric.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="100" height="125">Shakleton's efforts to keep alive, maintain spirits and ultimately 
            save his 27 men against all odds has brought him the accolade &quot;the 
            greatest leader ever - bar none&quot;. His hazardous and terrifying open 
            boat journey of 800 miles in the 22-foot &quot;James Caird' is called the 
            greatest of all time. I think it is a great story and, very 
            importantly, will highlight Shackleton's timeless leadership skills 
            - which can be learnt by anyone. <br>
            <br>
            The author meticulously researched her book over 15 years, the 
            anecdotes, crew dairies, contemporary material, historic photos, and 
            interviews with some of today's leaders, to illustrate Shackleton's 
            tactics. Each chapter ends with a summary of learning points such as 
            the path to leadership, hiring an outstanding crew, creating a 
            spirit of camaraderie, getting the best from each individual, 
            leading effectively in a crisis, forming teams for tough 
            assignments, etc. </font></p>

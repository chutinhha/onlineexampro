            about his career, chores and cameras</b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Please tell OER about your career path...<br>
            </b>&nbsp;After college (B.Sc. Major in Botany from the Madras 
            Christian College), I joined advertising more by accident than 
            intent. I actually took up an assignment in a tea estate, but didn't 
            like it - it was very lonely. I survived just about six months 
            there, and then came to advertising. There, I became an account 
            executive at Inter Publicity in India, and found the job very 
            exciting. More importantly, it allowed one to innovate and generate 
            ideas. I found myself very comfortable with that process. After a 
            year, I decided to take advertising a little more seriously, and 
            that's when I got a job with Lintas India Ltd, where I had the 
            chance to work with two very big names in the advertising industry - Alyque Padamsee and Gerson Da Cunha. <br>
            <br>
            In Lintas, I had the unique opportunity of being seconded to Levers 
            (Hindustan Levers Ltd). In fact, in my entire 10-11 years with 
            Lintas, I was managing the Levers account. Of this, two years of my 
            training was as product manager, Levers. That secured my career in 
            advertising to a great extent and I leveraged that into the 
            marketing process. This happened in the late 1970s, when I joined 
            MRF Tyres as advertising manager. Two years after I joined MRF, the 
            company got restructured, moving from tyre commodity position to a 
            customer segmented position. In this context, I took over as group 
            product manager for two- and four-wheelers. That moved me even more 
            securely into the marketing process. Since then, I've never looked 
            back. From MRF, I went on to the TTK group, and then to Wrigley's 
            India, where my last assignment was as its managing director. That's 
            how I migrated from advertising to marketing. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Why did you quit y</b><img border="0" src="fine.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="259"><b>our 
            job at Wrigley's, and how did you come to Oman?</b> <br>
            Wrigley's was set up as a standalone factory at a time when the 
            government of India did not allow the import of consumer products. 
            By the time the factory was set up and we started production, import 
            liberalisation took place. So there was a bit of conflict because 
            the grey market also emerged almost in parallel with our production 
            capacity. <br>
            <br>
            There were two other issues that influenced the chewing gum habit. 
            One was that Wrigley's was an entirely 'adult' chewing gum whereas 
            the market burgeoned in the bubble gum sector, in which Wrigley's 
            didn't participate at all. The second was that, after a research we 
            did, we figured that there was no chewing gum habit in the Indian 
            adults. While the Indian consumer 'chewed' heavily, it wasn't 
            chewing gum - it was gutkha, pan masala, beetle nut... anything but 
            chewing gum. We found ourselves at the end of a restricted niche 
            market. It was around that time that I had visited Oman for a 
            holiday. I liked the place a lot, and was offered this job with the 
            Zubair group, which I took up. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What does your role in the Zubair Corp entail?</b> <br>
            I have been with the Zubair Group for the past four years. As the 
            group general manager of Home and Business Solutions Division, I am 
            responsible for Business International Group, Photocentre LLC and 
            Zakher International. My job is to run and manage these divisions in 
            line with the group's vision. I provide strategic inputs in order 
            for the units to meet their business objectives. Photocentre is a 
            consumer products and services division, whereas Business 
            International Group is a projects business providing laboratory 
            equipment/education software and storage solutions. These are two 
            diverse businesses - the commonality being the quality of service 
            that we offer. I wear the hat of a business head, working with the 
            GMs in developing products and services, adding value where 
            possible. <br>
            <br>
            <b>How has the home &amp; business solutions landscape changed over the 
            last five years?</b> <br>
            The environment has changed, mainly driven by technology. Five years 
            ago, we hardly had any obsolescence to manage - now we have a 
            significantly high level of it. Secondly, the competitive scene has 
            become more aggressive. There are a lot of me-too brands coming in. 
            The fight is in providing distinctiveness and uniqueness in the 
            marketplace to have an edge over the other guy. The third is that 
            retailing is undergoing a significant change, particularly in Oman. 
            Five years ago, you had small retailers spread out throughout the 
            country. Today, with the arrival of the likes of Carrefour and Lulu 
            hypermarket, the retail scene is undergoing a significant change.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>At what stage is Oman as far as state-of-the-art business 
            solutions are concerned?</b> <br>
            If you're familiar with a product lifecycle curve, you know that it 
            moves up in the initial phases and stabilises once the product/ 
            market matures. The cycle starts with innovators (people who try out 
            the product/service for the first time), and then you have early 
            adopters (people who adapt to the product/service a little later), 
            and then the movers (mass consumers). It's at this stage that the 
            product theoretically plateaus off. Using the product lifecycle 
            analogy, I think Oman is at the Early Adopters stage. Hopefully, a 
            few years from now, the market will not only mature but much larger 
            consumer franchisee of each economy will grow. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Is working for the Zubair Corp in Oman any different from 
            working for the various groups in India?</b> <br>
            Interestingly, the groups that I worked for in India - TTK group, 
            MRF, Wrigley's - for that matter were all family-owned, 
            professionally-run businesses. So is the Zubair Corp, and the 
            similarities are
            <img border="0" src="fine1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="250" height="148">extremely 
            high. I report directly to the CEO of the group, continuously 
            evaluated by a board for the division. The board meets once a 
            quarter as all professionally run companies do, to measure the 
            performance and progress. <br>
            <br>
            The distinction is that while the market in Oman is relatively 
            small, the effort is on innovation. You've got to continuously 
            innovate to get noticed. This is not so true in India because in a 
            mass market, you can get away with just operational efficiencies. 
            Secondly, it is a relatively low-volumes market as compared to 
            India, and you have to manage your costs and profitability very 
            carefully. There is very little margin for error. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What difficulty, typical to Oman, do you face while growing the 
            home and business solutions market?</b> <br>
            From a business point of view, I find that Oman is transiting, but 
            in projects and particularly to a lesser extent products and 
            services, there is a great emphasis on price. I am worried that the 
            price-quality trade-off could start hurting businesses overall. I 
            hope that it is a phase, which will pass, but is a difficult process 
            when you have to invest a lot in educating the people why you charge 
            a premium. The smaller players operate on a price advantage and 
            basically limit their scope of operations to trading. The long-term 
            players tend to invest in people, better quality services, 
            after-sales support etc., all of which come at a cost. The issue is 
            one of participating and positioning your company in the market 
            place, where you will be appreciated for the quality of service you 
            provide while being competitive (not necessarily cheap). Over time, 
            one hopes that the customer will clearly appreciate the benefits of 
            a quality product/ service and understand the reasons for paying the 
            premium. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which advertising gurus do you favour and why? </b><br>
            I had the good fortune of meeting David Ogilvy in 1979-80 when he 
            came to India. I had the opportunity to hear him, meet him and talk 
            to him... so clearly he is one person who caused a very strong 
            impression on my mind. The second - because I had a hands-on working 
            experience with him - was Alyque Padamsee. The common learning that 
            I have imbibed from these two is customer-orientation. The closer 
            you are to a customer and the better you know him, the stronger the 
            ability to provide higher levels of satisfaction. The second 
            learning was that both of them propagated one common message: 
            simple, effective communication is the key to success. Being 
            advertising veterans, they have communicated their beliefs in a 
            passionate way. <br>
            <br>
            David Ogilvy was a copywriter, and his simplicity was in the words 
            that he selected. Alyque was a visualiser, and he operated through 
            the picture system. Both of them advocated the use of a 'single 
            idea' to communicate. The advertisements they created were powerful, 
            very emotive, and provoked strong customer reactions. These are 
            strong learnings from these two gentlemen - keep the ideas simple, 
            very focused, and talk to the consumer directly. I try to imbibe 
            this learning in my day-to-day operations. I like spending a lot of 
            time talking to customers and encouraging my employees to do the 
            same. <br>
            <br>
            <b>If you were to write your memoirs, what would it be titled?</b><br>
            Once More, With Feeling is probably what would make a title! <br>
            <br>
            <b>What would be the punch line for an ad for Nauzer Nowroji?</b><br>
            That's a tough one. Maybe Keep All Parts Working! is something that 
            I'd like to go for. You could get a laugh or a snare from the 
            audience, depending on the interpretation! <br>
            <br>
            <b>How many/what camera(s) do you possess? <br>
            </b>To be very honest, I have just three cameras. One of them is a 
            14-year-old Olympus (OM 10), which is an analog camera. My new 
            camera is a Fuji 300 series digital camera. I also have a Panasonic 
            video camera. I do take quite a bit of pictures, but I've been 
            migrating towards video more often now. I'm beginning to like 
            movement as against stills.

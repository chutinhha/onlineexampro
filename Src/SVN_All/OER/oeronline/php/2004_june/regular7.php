            adopting anti-piracy code </b><br>
            <br>
            Business Software Alliance (BSA), the leading NGO that represents 
            the interests of global and local software developers, in 
            association with the Omani Ministry of Trade and Industry, has 
            awarded a certificate of appreciation to Dhofar Cattle Feed Company 
            for strict adherence to BSA's Code of Ethics. The certificate was 
            presented to the company by Jawad Al Redha, co-chairman, BSA, at a 
            ceremony held recently. <br>
            <br>
            Commending Dhofar Cattle Feed on setting an example for other 
            companies, Al Redha said: &quot;Dhofar Cattle Feed has shown strong 
            commitment towards our campaign to promote the usage of original 
            licensed software by only using legal copies of software. We have 
            watched the company's progress and it is clear that the use of 
            original software has played an important role in helping the 
            company automate its work processes and achieve optimum production 
            levels.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;We are heartened by the recent developments in Oman on the 
            anti-piracy front. There has been a heightened awareness on IPR 
            issues, a development that we hope will contribute strongly towards 
            reducing piracy levels in the Omani market,' added Al Redha. &quot;Companies like Dhofar Cattle Feed are leading by example, and we 
            are confident that many others will follow suit, and thus strengthen 
            our hands in tackling one of the most serious issues affecting 
            today's businesses and economies. BSA appreciates the key role that 
            Dhofar Cattle Feed is playing in combating piracy issues.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &quot;Dhofar Cattle Feed Company has been established on the firm 
            foundation of ethics and right professional conduct. This is one of 
            the factors that has made us one of the leading companies in Oman, 
            earning the respect of the entire business community,' stated Eng. 
            Saeed Bin Salim Ahmed Al Shanfari, Managing Director, Dhofar Cattle 
            Feed Co. &quot;The development of the company has been driven in recent 
            years by Information Technology, and by shunning piracy, we believe 
            we can contribute towards supporting the IT industry. We are, 
            therefore, proud to adopt the BSA Code of Ethics across our 
            operations, a step that will guarantee that each employee of our 
            company is aware of the benefits of using original software.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            BSA began its renewed anti-piracy campaign in Oman in October 2003 
            when several Omani resellers and distributors signed the Code of 
            Ethics. In January 2004, the Omani Ministry of Heritage and Culture 
            announced its plan to launch fresh initiatives to support BSA's IPR 
            campaigns. <br>

            <br>
            Network Associates, Inc., the leading provider of intrusion 
            prevention solutions,<img border="0" src="netw.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="200"> announced recently that global research firm, 
            Gartner, Inc., has placed the company in the leader quadrant in its 
            'Magic Quadrant for Intrusion Detection Systems, 2H03'. The 
            research, which examined the security infrastructure products and 
            services of leading vendors in the intrusion detection and 
            prevention marketplace, gave Network Associates top scores, both on 
            'Completeness of Vision' and 'Ability to Execute for Security 
            Infrastructure'. <br>
            <br>
            Gartner's Magic Quadrant on IDS represents the performance and 
            capability of leading global IDS vendors and is based on a company's 
            viability, services and support, features and functionality, and 
            overall technology offerings. According to Gartner, vendors listed 
            in the leader quadrant are good performers, have a clear vision of 
            market direction and are actively building competencies to sustain 
            their leadership position in the market. &quot;Our position in the leader 
            quadrant for Gartner's highly-esteemed Magic Quadrant confirms 
            Network Associates
            commitment to delivering world-class intrusion prevention solutions 
            that proactively blocks security attacks for customers,' said 
            Parveen Jain, executive vice-president of McAfee marketing and 
            strategy at Network Associates. Commenting on the impact of 
            Gartner's findings on the company's operations in the Middle East, 
            Patrick Hayati, regional director, Network Associates, Middle East, 
            stated &quot;Being placed at the top of Gartner's Magic Quadrant 
            validates the fact that the company is effectively meeting the 
            challenge of providing cutting-edge security solutions. Recent virus 
            attacks such as the Sasser worm infestation have highlighted that 
            the protection offered by traditional IDS is not enough any longer.&quot;

            <b>Fujitsu launches Lifebook S7010 </b><br>
            <br>
            Fujitsu Siemens Computers (FSC), the leading international IT 
            company, has unveiled its new Lifebook S7010 notebook, powered by 
            Intel's innovative next generation mobile processor technology and 
            featuring new architecture that delivers 15 percent improved 
            performance<img border="0" src="fuj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="100" height="81"> as well as longer battery life. The Lifebook S7010 is 
            the first notebook to have Intel's latest ground-breaking Pentium M 
            processor technology codenamed 'Dothan'. Consisting of 140 million 
            transistors, Intel's new Pentium M processor is manufactured with 2 
            MB second-level cache and 90-nanometer semiconductor technology. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The Lifebook S7010 simply redefines the 14-inch notebook class. 
            Besides being small and lightweight, it brings optimum performance 
            through next-generation processor technology to users constantly on 
            the move or working in the field. Ideally, it targets professionals 
            who cannot be saddled with a heavy notebook and large display,' said 
            Susanne Lewitzki, product marketing manager, FSC. &quot;Weighing just 
            1.75 kg, the new notebook is the lightest and most versatile 
            companion for travelling professionals.' The Lifebook S7010's 
            modular bay allows extremely flexible use. For example, a DVD writer 
            can be swapped for a second battery or hard drive almost instantly. 
            The security panel, the integrated SmartCard controller and the 
            optional Trusted Platform Module help identify the computer in the 
            network and ensure secure authentication and data protection. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;In addition to weight, battery life and communications 
            capabilities, the Lifebook S7010 offers the highest levels of data 
            security and access protection,' said Lewitzki. &quot;In a world in which 
            mobility has become part of our every day life, a key consideration 
            is given to security. Professionals and top management officials 
            need extra assurance that their data is secure and cannot be 
            accessed by anybody else. Our new notebook carries this assurance, 
            besides giving the users the power and performance usually 
            associated with high-end PCs.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            The new Lifebook S7010 comes with an optional Wireless LAN and is 
            ready for Bluetooth V1.2 which provides ideal connectivity. Together 
            with its optical drive and comprehensive communications and security 
            features, the Lifebook S7010 offers professional users all the 
            functions of a fully equipped notebook.<br>

            <b>Epson launches Stylus Photo R800 in the Midle East </b><br>
            <br>
            Responding to the rapidly changing needs of the digital photography 
            market, Epson has launched the Stylus Photo R800, a new photo 
            printer incorporating UltraChrome Hi-Gloss pigment ink technology. 
            Maximising Epson's technological advancements, the Stylus Photo R800 
            enables the smallest details to be captured with its 1.5pl in<img border="0" src="eps.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="100" height="90">k 
            droplet Ð the smallest ink droplet in the world. This, combined with 
            Epson's Variable Sized Droplet Technology and a new MicroPiezo print 
            head, provides outstanding photographic reproduction at fast speeds 
            to satisfy the most demanding photographer.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The introduction of the Stylus Photo R800 is changing the face of 
            photo printing,' said Khalil El-Dalu, GM, Epson Middle East. &quot;For 
            the first time in the Middle East, professional and amateur 
            photographers can produce print quality previously only achieved 
            through traditional silver halide processes or high cost 
            professional printers. In addition, the benefits of digital 
            photography mean that photographers can now have total control Ñ 
            from capture through to final print Ñ and reprints and enlargements 
            can be achieved at the click of a &quot;print' button. The introduction 
            of UltraChrome Hi-Gloss pigment ink into the photo inkjet market 
            sets a standard that other manufacturers will aspire to match.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            The Stylus Photo R800 cartridges feature cyan, magenta, yellow, 
            matte black, photo black, red, blue and a new gloss optimiser. The 
            addition of red and blue ink ensures that the Stylus Photo R800 
            offers the widest colour gamut available from an inkjet photo 
            printer Ð bringing life to sky, seas, sunsets and autumn scenes. The 
            UltraChrome Hi-Gloss pigment ink is also designed for unsurpassed 
            print permanence in an A4 photo printer, with a lightfastness 
            estimated at over 80 years for glossy papers and over 100 years on 
            matte medias; a flexibility and durability that truly rivals silver 
            halide.</font></p>

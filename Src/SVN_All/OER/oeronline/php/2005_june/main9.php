            Ghosn, the exceptionally talented and remarkably industrious 
            President and CEO of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd will be in town on June 4, 
            2005, to mark the inauguration ceremony of the flagship showroom of 
            Nissan at Qurum. That the worldwide CEO of Nissan Motor has decided 
            to personally honour the occasion is testimony to the fact that this 
            is not your run-of-the-mill auto-showroom inauguration. <br>
            <br>
            To be sure, it is being touted as the world’s largest showroom for 
            Nissan – right here in Oman. And the world’s best will be here to 
            acknowledge the world’s largest. Nissan Motor Co. is a global 
            automotive company with 140,000 employees and $80 billion (RO30.77 
            billion) in revenue. Ghosn—pronounced ‘Gohn’—joined the company as 
            its chief operating officer in June 1999, became its president in 
            June 2000, and was named chief executive officer in June 2001. <br>
            <br>
            On April 29, 2005, Ghosn was named president and chief executive 
            officer of Renault S.A. in addition to his responsibilities at 
            Nissan. As head of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, he is responsible 
            for two separate companies with combined annual global sales of 5.7 
            million vehicles. If that wasn’t enough, he also currently serves on 
            the board of directors of Alcoa. That’s enough responsibility to 
            make mortals snap. <br>
            <br>
            But Ghosn is no mortal. The 51-year-old Brazilian-born Ghosn is an 
            engineer by qualification, but he earned his stripes the way many 
            white-collar types do, by his smarts and by investing many 
            exhausting hours for Michelin and Renault. From his humble 
            beginnings in 1981 as a plant manager of Le Puy Plant in Michelin, 
            France, Ghosn scrambled his way up to be come executive vice 
            president of Renault in 1996, being responsible for advanced 
            research, car engineering and development, car manufacturing, 
            powertrain operations, purchasing and supervision of Renault 
            activities in Mercosur.<br>
            <br>
            He was named commander of Nissan, however, for his ability to do 
            things no executive before him had tried: executing difficult and 
            life-changing decisions, the kind of radical surgery that ultimately 
            pulled Nissan away from a looming demise.<br>
            <br>
            In five years as Nissan’s COO and in the three years since becoming 
            CEO, Ghosn turned the company’s $22.9 billion (RO8.81 billion) debt 
            into a $7 billion (RO2.69 billion) profit. The corporate scalpel was 
            swift and decisive; he first alerted all interested Nissan parties 
            that nothing was more important than the company’s survival and 
            nothing—no relationship, no product, no person—was sacred. Then he 
            disemboweled the industry supplier caste system—known as 
            keiretsu—that awarded sweetheart contracts to interconnected firms.
            <br>
            <br>
            He focused Nissan on building fewer, better products on a narrowed 
            range of platforms and drivetrains. He huddled the talents at his 
            disposal, some from Japan, some from America, some from the French 
            headquarters of new stakeholder Renault, and set them to the task of 
            fixing things; he listened to their suggestions.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Nissan 180</b><br>
            When Ghosn was COO in 1999, he rolled out the three-year Nissan 
            Revival Plan, which put the company back to profitability after 
            years of accumulated debt in the late 1990s and saved the company 
            from bankruptcy. He followed that in 2002 with another three-year 
            plan, Nissan 180, which brought the company to the top rank of 
            profitability. <br>
            <br>
            The numerical figures in 180 are actually the company’s targets<br>
            1 - Additional sales of 1 million cars.<br>
            8 - Achieve operating margins of 8 per cent.<br>
            0 - Zero automotive debts.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Nissan ME</b><br>
            Nissan Middle East achieved record sales during the first half of 
            Nissan 180 period, with a growth up to 37 per cent on GCC sales 
            between October 2004 and March 2005. The results confirm that Nissan 
            and its regional dealers are on track towards achieving their 
            contribution towards Nissan’s global target of achieving an 
            additional 1 million vehicle sales by September 2005. <br>
            <img border="0" src="auto_news.jpg" width="100" height="128" align="right"><br>
            Introduction of new models such as the Armada and Murano joining the 
            SUV line up, the new Altima that was a distinct addition to the 
            sedan passenger cars and the full introduction of the luxurious 
            Infiniti line up contributed at large to this boost in sales. Proper 
            marketing of the products highly in demand in the Gulf market 
            seeking design and performance was also essential in the success 
            equation. <br>
            <br>
            <b>After 180</b><br>
            Nissan 180 ends September 30, but Ghosn has already announced the 
            first details of the next plan, called Value-Up. Value-Up’s goals 
            are to keep operating margin in the double digits and to keep the 
            company’s return on capital invested at 20 per cent or better. 
            Another goal is to reach an unprecedented 4.2 million vehicle sales 
            in 2007. The current plan, Nissan 180, still has one goal to go: 1 
            million more cars sold in model year 2005 than in fiscal 2001, or 
            3,597,000 units worldwide.</font></p>

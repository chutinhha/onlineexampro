            <b>By Ken Blanchard &amp; Sheldon Bowles<br>
            HarperCollins Business<br>

            </b><br>
            I have always loved books, especially the ones packed with practical 
            advice. And Big Bucks! is one such book, which provides inspiration 
            rather than a road map. This book isn’t about investing or squeezing 
            money you already have. It’s about making serious money in the first 
            place. <br>
            <br>
            Through a series of easy to follow steps and powerful strategies, 
            the authors unlock the secrets of making serious money for both you 
            and your company. They boil down a lot of data and research into a 
            few non-negotiables.<br>
            <br>
            What really struck me as I leafed through this book is its parable 
            style. In Big Bucks! I met Len who doesn’t just want more money; he 
            wants to be a millionaire. Under the direction and guidance of a 
            group of mentors, he goes on a journey to discover the secret to 
            becoming rich and meets three wise (and successful) people who 
            present simple truths: among them, you can’t make money unless you 
            are having fun; instead of trying to cut costs, companies should 
            devote themselves to increasing sales; and those who want to make a 
            lot of money need to make sure the firm they work for believes in 
            paying employees a lot.<br>
            <br>
            Simple messages are powerful, because we can remember them. I 
            subscribe to the themes in this book, and enjoyed reading how they 
            were articulated. Packed with practical advice, it’s a must-read for 
            any individual or business professional seeking wealth. It has 
            totally reinforced my personal belief that having fun while making 
            money is essential. About my only criticism is that it is somewhat 
            derivative of other motivational types such as Lou Tice (Reticular 
            activating systems); Ivan Meisner (Givers gain); and the granddaddy 
            of them all: Napoleon Hill (Think and Grow Rich).<br>
            <br>
            <b>
            <img border="0" src="im22.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="122"></b>One final Point: Big Bucks! also provides a conceptual 
            frame-of-reference within which to evaluate other books on wealth 
            accumulation. For that reason alone, it is a ‘must read.’ And is 
            definitely well worth the bucks!</font></p>

            <b>By Ken Blanchard, Bill Hybels and Phil Hodges<br>
            HarperCollins<br>
            Pp 189<br>
            RO5.600<br>
            </b><br>
            While Scores of books and articles have been written on the concept 
            of Leadership, treated by most, as “heavy reading stuff”, here is a 
            book which emphasises on the leadership concepts through a story or 
            a dialogue between three professionals, where Ken Blanchard becomes 
            ‘the professor’ who teams up with ‘the minister’ (Bill Hybels) to 
            coach a young manager (Phil Hodges) on leadership skills using 
            biblical principles. <br>
            <br>
            The book brings out the concept of Servant Leadership, which is best 
            described in the book as “The Paramount Aim of Servant Leaders is 
            the best interests of those they lead”. Blanchard employs his 
            easy-flowing style and minimal text per page to keep even the most 
            easily distracted reader on task. The topics are well organised and 
            numerous summaries and listings give the reader ample opportunity to 
            revisit important information.<br>
            <br>
            In fact, this book is a perfect prescription for managers/ leaders 
            of today who are overstressed and cannot maintain a work–life 
            balance, therefore facing the unpleasant consequences arising out of 
            it. The authors have given an overdose of Jesus and his teachings 
            but should not lead to be construed that this book is a discourse on 
            Christianity – in fact, Jesus has been exemplified as a true leader 
            and what is inspiring is the 12 steps to faith-walk leadership which 
            can really drive peace into the worked up and frenzied minds of 
            managers of today!<br>
            <br>
            Finally, the book concludes with three lists of checkpoints focusing 
            on leadership character, leadership methods and leadership behaviour. 
            These checkpoints summarise
            <img border="0" src="im23.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="122">the key messages and, in my opinion, can 
            be used as a ready-reckoner for today’s managers/leaders. The 
            practical value of Leadership by the Book cannot be overstated, and 
            I believe that this book, while being inspirational, can also serve 
            as a valuable and informative guide.</font></p>

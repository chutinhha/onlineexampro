Associates legacy renewal solution enters general availability</b><br>
Computer Associates, one of the world’s largest management software companies 
announced the availability of its Legacy Renewal Solution, a knowledge-based 
service that automates the conversion of legacy COBOL applications to J2EE, .NET 
and Web services without rewriting source code. <br>
<br>
According to Tactical Strategy Group, 75 per cent of the world's business data 
is still processed in COBOL, so a major challenge for IT organizations is to 
retain and extend the value of these legacy investments through migration to 
modern <br>
environments. <br>
<br>
CA's Legacy Renewal Solution captures code-based business rules and stores them 
separately from any specific implementation technology. It automatically 
extracts the rules and data into CA's AllFusion Gen, which generates 100 percent 
of the new code from diagrams that mirror the customer's business requirements. 
Converted business rules can be easily augmented and enhanced to support an 
organization's current business practices. </font></p><hr size="1">

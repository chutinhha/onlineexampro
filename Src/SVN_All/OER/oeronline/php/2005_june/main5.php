Trade ties<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The GCC countries are of prime economic, 
political and strategic importance to India, and are now India’s second largest 
trading partner after the US with the trade turnover of about $6,802 million 
annually. Both India and GCC have to realise that in view of the intense 
international competitive environment, time is not necessarily on their side. An 
overview by Salem Al Ismaily, Executive President of OCIPED</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>
<img border="0" src="bilate1.jpg" width="200" height="118" align="left"></b><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>I</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ndia 
and GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries, viz. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have close cultural and economic 
relations. The GCC countries are of prime economic, political and strategic 
importance, and are now India’s second largest trading partner after the US with 
a trade turnover of about $6,802 million (RO2,616 million) annually. <br>
<br>
Over 3.3 million Indians, the largest expatriate community in the region, live 
and work in the GCC, annually repatriating nearly $5 billion (RO1.92 billion). 
Two-thirds of India’s oil imports are from this region that not only has the 
advantage of geographical proximity, but also has the quality of crude oil to 
suit Indian refineries. Cooperation in the energy sector has been the hallmark 
of India-GCC ties, and India stands to be one of the largest markets for GCC 
energy products in years to come.<br>
<br>
The liberalisation of Indian economy has yielded substantial benefits to the 
GCC. According to the Ministry of Commerce, Government of India, GCC exports to 
India have increased from $1,565.95 million (RO602.29 million) in fiscal year 
2001-02 to an estimated $1889.25 million (RO726.63 million). Indian exports to 
GCC countries during the same period have increased from $3798.05 million 
(RO1460.79 million) to $4913.03 million (RO1889.63 million). <br>
<br>
The UAE has the distinction of being the largest trading partner of India in the 
GCC followed by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. The GCC’s largest 
export to India appears to be oil, and main product groups imported from India 
to GCC are textiles, precious metals and food products. <br>
<br>
<b>Bilateral trade ties</b><br>
Indian visitors and Indian residents of the GCC constitute one of the largest 
groups of travellers between India and the Gulf. As per the data available, 
Indians have made substantial investments in the GCC. Expatriate Indians 
constitute a major business community with investments in trade, manufacturing, 
retailing and services. India too is a significant business and tourism 
destination for citizens of the GCC countries.<br>
<br>
India has a satisfactory track record in the GCC in terms of the contribution 
made by Indian industry. Indian companies have handled major construction 
projects – international airport at Abu Dhabi, crude/gas treatment plant in 
Zirku Island, UAE, transmission tower project – UAE, Urea Hydrolyser – Qatar, 
Gathering Centre – Kuwait, Salalah Power Project – Oman, and Formaldehyde 
Expansion Project, Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
Indian companies continue to supply Critical equipment to the GCC countries as 
Evaporator Modules and Ammonia Converter Baskets (UAE); Waste Heat Recovery 
Boilers, Stripper Columns, Slug Catchers and Polypropylene Reactors (Saudi 
Arabia) – and are respected for the quality of the equipment. <br>
In addition, India has considerable experience in industrialisation and 
expertise to offer to GCC nations that are in the process of diversifying their 
industrial base to reduce dependence on the oil sector.<br>
<br>
<b>GCC initiative for economic progress</b><br>
GCC countries have also initiated measures for economic liberalisation. These 
include a move towards permitting foreigners to own business and properties. The 
Free Zones are attracting overseas companies to establish their bases in these 
countries, and Indian companies constitute the largest groups. The UAE has a 
lead in this regard over other GCC countries. <br>
<br>
This trend is expected to continue. The existing international political and 
economic environment is motivating the GCC countries to look at India for 
investments, for which there are excellent opportunities. Earlier, destinations 
in the West were favoured. This is a noticeable change that augurs well for 
strengthening the economic and industrial cooperation between GCC countries and 
India.<br>
<br>
The economic indicators for the region are encouraging. Total GDP of the region 
stands at about $321 billion (RO123.46 billion). The regional average per capita 
is about $10,380 (RO3992.31) at current prices with $8,000 (RO3,076.92) in Saudi 
Arabia, $8,200 (RO3,153.85) in Oman and $21,000 (RO8,076.92) in Qatar. The World 
Bank classifies the region as High-Income Group category. The region witnessed 
an average growth rate of six per cent per annum, at current prices from the 
1991 to 2000. <br>
<br>
GCC countries continue to rely extensively on hydrocarbons for their revenues. 
The region contains almost 45 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, 
accounts for 20 per cent of the world’s oil production and 23 per cent of 
world’s total exports.<br>
<br>
The realisation of the European common market, emergence of North American Free 
Trade Agreement, far reaching changes in the former USSR, and the economic 
resurgence in the Asian continent, especially in India and China, have impacted 
the GCC countries. Such initiatives are not limited to developed countries 
alone. Damascus Declaration for the greater Arab free market has been signed and 
is being implemented ahead of original schedule allowing free trading among 
member states by the end of 2005.<br>
<br>
GCC countries have accepted globalisation with an open mind. Annual tariff 
reduction, which started in 1998, is being carried out so that full trade 
liberalisation for goods of Arab origin can be achieved by end-2005. For 
centuries the region has been active in international trade and commerce and all 
but one GCC countries are members of WTO. GCC countries have witnessed 
significant developments in terms of adoption of Joint Agricultural Policy, 
Unified Industrial Development Strategy, the general framework of the GCC 
population strategy and the long-term comprehensive development strategy (2000 
to 2025). <br>
<br>
The unified economic agreement stresses the establishment of GCC joint projects 
in industry, agriculture and services using public, private or mixed capital in 
order to achieve economic integration with productive interface and common 
development on sound economic basis. It also encourages the private sector to 
set up joint projects linking the economic interest in all fields. Within this 
framework, a number of joint projects in industry, insurance, airline services, 
animal and fisheries have been set up.<br>
<br>
Trade integration is a priority. GCC Countries are unifying their industrial 
regulations and legislations to facilitate distribution of industries all over 
the GCC by encouraging establishment of basic projects according to the 
comparative economic advantage. To fulfil this objective, GCC countries have 
ratified the unified industrial strategy. The unified economic agreement has 
exempted all industrial products of GCC origin from Customs Duties and other 
such charges.</font></p>
<p align="center" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<img border="1" src="map.jpg" width="476" height="302"></font></p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The GCC has also 
unified a number of trade regulations such as the Unified Guiding Regulation of 
Commercial Agencies, The Model Regulation of Trademarks, The unified Law of 
Commerce, the unified Commercial Registry Law and the unified Law of Customs. 
Several preliminary initiatives would ultimately result in the creation of the 
Gulf Common Market.<br>
<br>
The GCC Customs Union, formed in January 2003, provides for a unified Customs 
tariff of only five per cent on goods imported into any of the GCC countries and 
their subsequent movement within the region. Not only the import needs of 
manufacturing industries have been kept in view, but over 400 items have been 
included in the unified exemption list. Creation of a monetary union with a 
common currency is on the agenda as well. Other regional initiatives include a 
common GCC electricity grid and pipeline network to carry natural gas to 
consumers in the region.<br>
<br>
The GCC has agreed to permit national banks of member states to open branches in 
other member countries. Gulf Network of the National ATM Networks has been 
established and improved the centrality of Risks Law, the efficiency of capital 
and risks of Assets Law and the credit concentration in the GCC Banks Law. <br>
<br>
There is now a unified approach at the Annual Meetings of IMF and the World 
Bank. The Gulf Investment Corporation aims at supporting and developing GCC 
economic and financial resources. Model regulation for promotion of foreign 
investment in the GCC has been endorsed along with unified policies in the areas 
of agriculture and water leading to joint projects.<br>
<br>
There is coordination in setting up infrastructure projects such as seaports, 
airports and highways. There is a unified treatment to passenger and cargo 
movements within the GCC territory with exemption from all duties and taxes. An 
agreement has been reached to allow steamers, ships and boats and their cargoes 
belonging to the member states to freely use the port facilities. National 
airlines are able to sell directly in the GCC countries without the need for 
general agents of local sponsors.<br>
<br>
GCC countries have a population of 31 million, with 70 per cent under the age of 
25, 60 per cent under the age of 21 and about 50 per cent under the age of 15. 
The demographic structure is both a challenge and a provider of unprecedented 
opportunities in the region, which include issues pertaining to education, 
housing, availability of food, and ever-growing requirements of infrastructure. 
Social policy change is an important area. The demand for quality education and 
training, healthcare, and entertainment is expected to go up immensely.<br>
<br>
The population also constitutes a potential reservoir of human resources, which 
can be highly productive through the skills in information and communications 
technology to which they would be exposed at a young age. If it is to be looked 
at as a market potential, then it is a population with the highest disposable 
income in the developing countries. Other areas that would see substantial 
growth are food, beverages and pharmaceuticals.<br>
<br>
There is a coordinated approach in the area of science and technology, with 
stress on joint programmes and centres covering various scientific and technical 
spheres. A patent regulation has been ratified and GCC Patent Office 
established.<br>
<br>
Education and social fields have seen changes as well – curricula in the fields 
of mathematics and science have been unified. The Arab Bureau of Education for 
the Gulf States has been established in Riyadh and Arab Centre for Educational 
Research in Kuwait. Their objective is to achieve educational equality for all 
GCC citizens. <br>
<br>
There is promotion of social care, security, aid and development. The Executive 
Bureau of the Ministers of Labour and Social Affairs Council has been entrusted 
with the responsibility of designing a comprehensive social strategy for the GCC.
<br>
Preparatory steps have been initiated to adopt a unified modern legislation for 
rehabilitation and employment of the handicapped.<br>
<br>
There is a strategic framework – General Policies and Principles for Environment 
protection that aims at formulating proper scientific formulae to protect the 
environment and maintain the natural resources in the member states. A unified 
regulation for protection of Wild Life, Environment Impact Assessment, Handling 
Radio-active materials, Waste Recycling and transfer of hazardous waste through 
GCC borders has been ratified.<br>
<br>
<b>Indian economy on the move</b><br>
The Indian economy has made great strides in the last few decades and is now 
termed as one of BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) economies—fastest 
growing economies of the world—by renowned economist Goldman Sachs, according to 
whose report, India will be one of the largest economies in the world by 2020 
and an economic super power by 2050. <br>
This view is shared by leading economists and policymakers in the world. There 
have been positive developments in several areas, which is reflected in the 
increasing growth rates in the last few years, besides the forecast of over 
eight per cent growth per annum. Positives of the Indian economy are: </font></p>

</ul>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Investment 
opportunities in India</b><br>
India offers attractive opportunities to GCC countries for investment. The 
industrial policy reforms have eliminated industrial licensing requirements 
except for select sectors such as defence (opened up recently to a limited 
extent). Restrictions on investment and expansion have been removed and the 
policy facilitates easy access to foreign technology and direct investment.<br>
<br>
The entire gamut of exploration and production, refining, transportation and 
distribution of retail marketing activities in the oil &amp; gas sector presents 
opportunities for foreign direct investment. The mining sector has potential for 
exploration ventures in gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, 
molybdenum, lithium, tin, tungsten, silver, platinum and other rare metals – 
chromite, manganese ore and fertiliser minerals. Manufacturing units for 
value-added mining products too can be set up.<br>
<br>
Power and telecommunication sectors have major opportunities for foreign 
investment. Infrastructure needs major investment: </font></p>
<ul dir="ltr">
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Roads: $50 billion 
  (by 2010)</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Airports: $12 
  billion</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Ports: $18 billion</font></p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Urban 
  infrastructure: $59 billion.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Special Economic 
Zones (SEZs) offer a variety of incentives and benefits including 100 per cent 
FDI inthe manufacturing sector permitted through automatic route barring a few 
sectors, 100 per cent income-tax exemption for a block of five years and an 
additional 50 per cent for two years thereafter, exemption on Customs duties on 
import of capital goods, raw materials, consumables, spares and other such 
facilities.<br>
<br>
<b>Investment opportunities in the GCC</b><br>
Food processing, chemicals, electrical, mechanical and civil engineering, 
textiles and garments, information technology, telecommunications, education and 
training would continue to be the key areas for investment. Full ownership is 
now permitted in industries and services. There is no insistence on a local 
partner, though it would be realistic to go in for joint ventures with local 
investors in view of the special characteristics of this market.<br>
<br>
The ongoing cooperation in the energy sector can be strengthened further, with 
India providing the management skills and the technological innovations. GCC 
countries are keen to diversify the non-oil sector and provide employment 
opportunities to the new generation. Local SME development is a priority, as it 
would create gainful employment. India with its enormous experience in the 
development of SMEs can assist young GCC entrepreneurs to set up facilities in 
manufacturing, services and hi-tech areas. GCC governments are keen to assist 
such a development.<br>
<br>
<b>Challenges</b><br>
Despite the major investment programs undertaken within the GCC states over the 
past 30 years, all Gulf countries remain vulnerable to international pressure as 
their economies continue to depend on one source of income with full economic 
diversification remaining an elusive goal so far. <br>
<br>
The positive aspect is the growing maturity of the indigenous private sector and 
its leaders recognising their role and responsibilities. But as the private 
sector is not involved in decision-making it hampers economic performance. In 
some cases, the public sector acts as a competitor to the private sector.<br>
<br>
To meet the challenges created by demography, the threats and opportunities of 
increasing globalisation, the need for enhanced educational and human resource 
programmes for the knowledge-based economy, the private sector needs to develop 
more effective vehicles to communicate with governments, with private sector 
driven policy approaches and solutions to meet the emerging challenges.<br>
<br>
It is to be recognised that with increasing cohesion and consistency of approach 
within the six GCC countries, there is continuing isolation from the three 
important neighbours – Iran, Iraq and Yemen, which have varying interest and 
linkages to the GCC both in the past and at present. Iran, the largest in terms 
of size and population with its own economic capabilities but with major 
economic challenges, can derive benefits from the experience of GCC’s 
development process.<br>
<br>
Iraq, the second largest country, with the overthrow of the Saddam regime has to 
be looked at with a new perspective taking into account the after-effects of war 
and the emerging instability. Yemen, though economically relatively weak, has 
the largest population of any Arabian Peninsula State and its instability would 
directly affect every Gulf state.<br>
<br>
A second area of economic interest is the emerging economies of East Africa. It 
has now emerged as a viable business partner in the global market and GCC 
countries, being major trade partners, have new opportunities. Central Asian 
Republics of the CIS, which are in the process of diversifying their economies, 
no longer operate in a vacuum and are surrounded by important regional powers 
that will impact their future.<br>
<br>
GCC can play a positive role in the process of developing the long-term 
geopolitical future for the region. A wider regional dialogue and cooperation 
with the above named countries would be necessary and useful. <br>
<br>
India can play a positive and supportive role as well. It is close not only to 
GCC, but also to Iran, Iraq, Yemen, East African and CIS countries. There is an 
excellent opportunity to develop a collaborative approach, which would help the 
entire region to build a strong future. <br>
<br>
Both GCC and India need to continuously explore and exploit opportunities and 
possibilities of mutually beneficial economic cooperation and industrial 
collaboration in the following areas:</font></p>
<ul dir="ltr">
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Ensuring secured 
  supplies of energy, oil &amp; natural gas to India.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Benefiting from the 
  Indian experience of the dynamic SME sector to build joint ventures. </font>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">From a GCC 
perspective, the need to redefine relations with India arises in view of the 
systematic deficit faced by the GCC as pointed out by the Arab Human Development 
Report. It is also pertinent that India is the energy market for them. Despite 
the prosperity, the Gulf society is still not in the global mainstream. In 
particular, its human resources and institutions are not yet evolved to face the 
rapidly changing world. Being a signatory to the WTO, the region has to comply 
with new rules and norms. It needs capacity building. It is here that the Indian 
experience is most relevant and can complement in an appropriate manner.<br>
<br>
The GCC-India Industrial Conference, held in February 2004 at Mumbai, apart from 
being the first-ever formal economic dialogue between GCC and India, was the 
beginning of the new rationale of building economic ties. The theme of the 
Conference—Opportunities and Challenges in the 21st Century—captured the new 
spirit. Its focus was on four priority areas: trade, investments, industrial 
cooperation including SMEs, and transfer of technology including information 
technology.<br>
<br>
India and GCC are on the threshold of signing a framework agreement that 
provides for signing a Free Trade Agreement, which will give a new strategic 
dimension to their economic relations. The Conference received spontaneous 
support from member countries of the GCC, demonstrated by the presence of six 
ministerial delegations, chambers of commerce, and a large number of individual 
businessmen. The Indian response was equally encouraging.<br>
<br>
In this connection, the six-point agenda for cooperation suggested by the 
President of Confederation of Indian Industry, in his address to the Conference 
was most significant.<br>
<br>
a) Adopt the route of bilateral investments with reference to following 
Industrial sectors in India:<br>
&nbsp; i) Mining and minerals.<br>
&nbsp; ii) Infrastructure<br>
&nbsp; iii) Power and telecom.<br>
&nbsp; iv) Special economic zones.<br>
&nbsp; v) Vocational training and education.<br>
<br>
b) Enhance linkages between business communities through identification of 
business opportunities and building relationship.<br>
<br>
c) Expansion of basket of bilateral trade.<br>
<br>
d) Cooperation in emerging areas – information technology, biotechnology, 
healthcare, drugs, pharmaceuticals, financial services.<br>
<br>
e) Enhance educational and human resource programs through vocational and 
continuing education and training.<br>
<br>
f) Investments in oil/gas-based industries in India.<br>
Both India and GCC have to realise that in view of the intense international 
competitive environment, time is not necessarily on their side. The future of 
the region depends on their strong and meaningful partnership. If the 
opportunity is missed now, it may not come again in the very near future. </font>

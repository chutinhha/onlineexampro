                    one could formulate a recipe to prepare this man, this is 
                    how it would read. Take a load-full of grit, add a dash of 
                    determination, throw in a tonne of perseverance, fortitude, 
                    endurance and stamina, and, of course, heaps of intellect, 
                    aptitude and business acumen, and voila! What you'll get 
                    will be Abdul Kader Askalan, the chief executive officer of 
                    Oman Arab Bank (OAB), one of the country's top banks. <br>
                    <br>
                    He lost his father, a trading merchant, in 1952, when he 
                    himself was all of 15 years old. The onus of raising a 
                    family of three came on the tender shoulders of this young 
                    boy who had barely stepped into his teens at that time. &quot;It 
                    was a big challenge for me. After all, I was so young,'' he 
                    recalls. <br>
                    <br>
                    At that age and under those circumstances, any normal person 
                    would have cracked under the pressure of being confronted by 
                    the harsh realities of life - the loss of a father and the 
                    responsibility of looking after his mother and a younger 
                    brother. But Askalan is stuff legends are made of. Not one 
                    to shy away from responsibility, he not only rose to the 
                    occasion and took over the reins of his family, but also 
                    became determined to be the best in whatever life had in 
                    store for him. <br>
                    <br>
                    Extremely fond of outdoor activities and sports, Askalan had 
                    always cherished a dream of becoming a pilot. However, his 
                    mother, fearing for his life, was averse to any kind of 
                    risk. &quot;I could have been a pilot, but my mother stopped 
                    me,'' he says. The dream of flying high in the sky that he 
                    nurtured remained unfulfilled. However, even though he never 
                    flew a plane, the heights that he has scaled are tremendous 
                    and commendable.</font></p>

                    <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>A noble laureate</b><br>
                    Askalan is a titan in his own way. Born and brought up in 
                    Nablus, Jordan, he finished his studies from Al-Najah 
                    National College. A self-made man, he has carved his way up 
                    by sheer hard work. He began his career in 1957 as a clerk 
                    in the Arab Bank in Yemen. Later on, in 1970, he moved to 
                    the UAE to join the bank's branch there. <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1973, when for the first time Arab Bank Oman set up its 
                    branch in the Sultanate, Askalan was entrusted with the 
                    administration of the branches in the country. This was a 
                    time when the bank was making losses. However, with 
                    Askalan's skills and determined efforts, the bank posted 
                    profits within a period of two years. &quot;I reversed the trend 
                    and made the branches profitable for the next 10 years,'' he 
                    beams. <br>
                    <br>
                    From 1984 till date, the equity of OAB has grown 500 per 
                    cent, and the bank has expanded throughout the Sultanate. 
                    From 5 outlets in 1984, there are 45 branches of the bank in 
                    the country today. Askalan successfully steered the 
                    loss-making bank to become one of the leading banks in Oman. 
                    In fact, Askalan proudly recollects that &quot;Arab Bank's Oman 
                    branch opened Oman government's first account to be 
                    independently operated by the Ministry of Finance.'' <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1984, Askalan convinced the management of Arab Bank to 
                    take in an Omani company as partner and offered 50 per cent 
                    of the bank's shares to Oman International Development &amp; 
                    Investment Co. (Ominvest). &quot;Thus, the Omani public got the 
                    opportunity to share up to 50 per cent of the bank's profits 
                    since then,'' he claims. In addition, shareholders of OAB 
                    have received annual dividends of not less than 20 per cent 
                    on an average since the last 19 years. &quot;Ever since, the bank 
                    has grown from strength to strength,'' he maintains. And 
                    there was no looking back for him either. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Management mores </b><br>
                    All CEOs have a different style of working. As for Askalan, 
                    he believes in taking the bull by its horns. &quot;As the captain 
                    of my team, I believe in employing a hands-on approach 
                    whenever required,'' he informs. However, he feels it is 
                    important to delegate tasks to his senior officers for the 
                    efficient functioning of the company. &quot;I believe in 
                    delegating tasks to my colleagues as the senior officers 
                    will not be able to develop themselves unless you delegate 
                    tasks to them,'' he says. <br>
                    <br>
                    While Askalan considers his bank employees as the main 
                    pillars of strength of his organisation, for him, his 
                    customers are of utmost importance. &quot;In my philosophy, I 
                    look at customers as our business partners and it goes 
                    without saying, being a partner, we should provide the best 
                    possible service to them at all times,'' he proclaims. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Banking challenges </b><br>
                    According to Askalan, the main challenge the banking 
                    industry will continue to face is maintaining strong asset 
                    quality. Here, he has a word of advice for his peers with 
                    ambitions that transcend Oman's borders and go beyond the 
                    country's boundary. &quot;Banks in Oman should not consider 
                    profit as their main motive and should not venture into 
                    unknown territories without a proper feel of that market's 
                    environment,'' he cautions.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Banks wanting cross-border exposures should be physically 
                    present in those locations for a reasonable amount of time. 
                    It is always prudent to spend some time in understanding the 
                    foreign market and then gradually sourcing funds from the 
                    same location and deploying it there,&quot; he advises. Another 
                    challenge, Askalan believes, is competition from 
                    international banks as a result of the WTO (World Trade 
                    Organisation) regulations. He feels the time is apt for 
                    local banks to improve their services if they want to retain 
                    their customer base. Those banks which do not adapt will be 
                    out of business, he foresees.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Family man </b><br>
                    Besides being a banker and the tough taskmaster he is, 
                    Askalan has a soft side as well. He is a proud father of 
                    four daughters and has a loving wife, Itedal. Each of his 
                    daughters has excelled in her own field - doctor, engineer, 
                    architect and lawyer. &quot;What more can you ask for,'' he 
                    proclaims proudly. Besides a close-knit family, Askalan has 
                    a very distinguished circle of friends. Despite his tight 
                    schedule, he makes a point to take time out for his friends 
                    at least once a week, if not more. He loves spending time 
                    with his dear ones. Besides, he is fond of reading books, 
                    listening to Arabic music and most of all, playing tennis 
                    throughout the week to keep fit. <br>
                    <br>
                    Askalan is also a great traveller. &quot;I like to diversify my 
                    geography and every destination is a favourite of mine. 
                    Every year, I try to visit different countries/ cities in 
                    the world and make the most of my holiday with my family,'' 
                    he says. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Dream for Oman </b><br>
                    Oman has come a long way from the time Askalan entered the 
                    business world decades ago. Today, Oman is moving towards 
                    its goal of being a non-oil dependent economy. In this 
                    regard, Askalan feels that more needs to be done. According 
                    to him, to become independent of oil and gas revenues, the 
                    country should move forward by developing other sectors like 
                    agriculture, industry, tourism and services. &quot;The Cabinet, 
                    under the wise leadership of His Majesty, is continuously 
                    working hard to devise ways and means to reduce dependency 
                    on oil and gas. The private sector has also demonstrated its 
                    keenness to be a part of this exercise and I am very 
                    confident this will grow manifold in the years to come,'' he 
                    says. Insha Allah!</font></p>

            Electronics recently re-iterated its global leadership position to 
            distributors at the company's 'Middle East IT Distributor' summit 
            held in Seoul, Korea. Aimed at expanding the knowledge base of the 
            Middle East technology distribution community, Samsung showcased at 
            the summit several cutting-edge IT digital products including the 
            world's largest 40-inch TFT-LCD monitor, fastest 8x DVD-RAM and 
            first-of-a-kind digital imaging solutions. ''The Middle East IT

            marketing, advertising and media portal launched</b>
            <img border="0" src="tech2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" width="125" height="141" vspace="3">Strategiy.com, 
            the Middle East's first dedicated marketing, advertising and media 
            portal has launched its operations in the region. The portal is a 
            B2B (business to business) initiative aimed at offering industry 
            professionals a one-stop resource to information and services 
            concerning the region's marketing and advertising professionals 
            across industries such as FMCG, airlines, banking, consumer 
            electronics, IT, automobiles, foods &amp; beverages, media and ad 
            agencies, among others. <br>
            <br>
            The portal - www.strategiy.com - responds to the growing need for an 
            authentic, industry-wide information archive to cover marketing and 
            advertising in the region's burgeoning industry. The interactive 
            portal's content and services include latest news, discussion 
            forums, agency databases, latest marketing campaigns, exhibition and 
            events calendar, interviews and features on Middle East business 
            leaders, appointments and recruitment services, accessible at no 
            charge. <br>
            <br>
            Explaining the concept behind Strategiy.com, CEO Farhat Rana 
            commented: &quot;The Middle East marketing and advertising market has 
            witnessed a revolutionary change in the past decade. With the entry 
            of global brands and MNCs, the market is all set to become intensely 
            competitive. The demand for advertising and marketing services has 
            also increased. This has created a parallel need for a dedicated 
            industry resource where marketers, advertisers and media 
            professionals can update themselves and analyse the latest news and 
            events in the region's business world. Strategiy.com has been 
            conceptualised to respond to this need by delivering a truly 
            comprehensive range of content and services under a single 
            umbrella.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Moreover, the site also informs Middle East professionals on what's 
            happening in marketing and advertising in various industries at a 
            global level. In a globalised world, what happens elsewhere is 
            eventually bound to influence your business here. Our mission is to 
            be the most preferred provider of news and analysis for the Middle 
            East's marketing, advertising and media professionals.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Explaining the thought behind the name www.strategiy.com, Rana said: 
            ''One cannot go far by merely copying others. To make a mark in 
            business, you have to put individualism into your strategy. In other 
            words, to excel in your profession, you have to put the &quot;I&quot; in your 
            strategy.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The region's marketing community and aspiring professionals have 
            long been looking for a dedicated platform to access the latest news 
            and focused services for this industry. Now, at the click of a 
            button, they can access up-to-date databases of advertising, public 
            relations, events or direct marketing agencies. The opinion poll and 
            discussion forum sections offer valid insight on current advertising 
            and marketing–related issues, helping strategists identify current 
            trends in the industry. We also feature award-winning international 
            campaigns and specialised industry analyses to provide 'intellectual 
            food for thought' and help marketers and advertisers improvise their 
            strategies to suit the Middle East's multi-cultural audiences,&quot; 
            continued Rana. </font></p>

            healthcare industry</b> <br>
            <img border="0" src="tech1.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="125" height="138" vspace="4">As 
            the healthcare industry in the Middle East is growing rapidly, there 
            is a critical need among healthcare institutes and government health 
            organisations to adopt integrated IT solutions capable of supporting 
            their increased operations. Healthcare Solutions (HCS), a leading 
            provider of healthcare information solutions in the Middle East, and 
            part of the Al Babtain Group, has recently introduced the ASP 
            Healthcare Model, an end-to-end back office Web-based solution that 
            can take care of the clinical, administrative and technological 
            aspects of patient services. ASP Healthcare is the first healthcare 
            portal in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council). <br>
            <br>
            Amr Mostafa, general manager, Healthcare Solutions, stated: &quot;Today's 
            highly competitive, resource-tight healthcare market has 
            necessitated the increased deployment of technology among healthcare 
            institutes in order to gain competitive edge in the time- and 
            cost-effectiveness of health services delivery. Progressive 
            organisations are fast realising that they need a sound and scalable 
            IT infrastructure to support their operations and minimize costs.&quot;
            <br>
            <br>
            Until recently, IT solutions available in the region were too 
            fragmented and diversified to meet the multiple needs of healthcare 
            services provided by healthcare organisations and institutes. The 
            partitioning and incompatibility of existing systems made fast 
            access to integrated information almost impossible. In order to make 
            informed decisions in this environment, health organisations need 
            real-time access to reliable and relevant information. <br>
            <br>
            Commenting further on the solution, Mostafa added: &quot;The ASP 
            Healthcare model operates as a one-stop healthcare service portal by 
            optimising the administrative and clinical management of the 
            healthcare institute and creating an integrated information network. 
            It provides managers and clinicians with information essential to 
            making effective decisions, which in turn will result in better 
            services to their patients. The solution is economical, scalable, 
            flexible and adaptable.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Given the sensitive nature of the information, data security is 
            also taken care of. By being a part of the ASP Healthcare Community, 
            the Middle East health sector will benefit from the power of a 
            proven solution with access to a local and regional support centre,&quot; 
            he concluded. </font></p>

            mobile phones</b> <br>
            <img border="0" src="tech3.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" width="100" height="315">Panasonic, 
            the leading global manufacturer of consumer electronics and home 
            appliances, has recently unveiled a range of innovative mobile 
            phones targeted especially at women. The line-up includes the tiny 
            clamshell X66, compact X70 and trendy-looking, G51 and A100 models, 
            all innovatively designed and packed with handy features. Commenting 
            on the new range, Shigeru Uno, GM (Systems Products), Panasonic 
            Marketing Middle East FZE stated: ''Panasonic's new range of mobile 
            phones such as X66, G51 and A100 cater to the rising demand for 
            functional, yet feminine phones for the next-generation woman. The 
            mobile phone is increasingly being seen as a fashion accessory, 
            especially among female customers, a trend that has caught on the 
            Middle East market as well. Our new mobile phones are not only sleek 
            and stylish, they also make use of Panasonic's prowess in digital 
            technology by delivering superior sound and high-resolution colour 
            display. In fact, we believe that our proven strengths in the 
            innovative design and technology aspects will help Panasonic drive a 
            larger share in the competitive regional mobile phone markets.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            The new phones are also optimised to take advantage of the latest 
            mobile technologies such as GPRS that are now available in some 
            countries in the region. For example, the compact 'clamshell' style 
            X66, the latest in the range, is MMS and GPRS-enabled, while its 
            stylish and compact appearance is designed to draw attention to the 
            user. <br>
            <br>
            This sleek 82-gm device can be worn around the neck as a fashion 
            accessory or can fit snugly into the slimmest handbag. Besides its 
            attractive appearance, the phone has a built-in 110K pixels 
            resolution, high-speed camera with a side-key that lets the user 
            take pictures even when the phone is closed. The phone has another 
            handy feature: it has a vivid colour display alert every time the 
            phone rings that changes for incoming messages. The 65,536 colour 
            display phone is MMS and GPRS-enabled, with a hands-free speaker and 
            16-polyphonic ring tones. <br>
            <br>
            The clamshell X70 takes advantage of Panasonic's famous digital 
            imaging and zooming and is fitted with a large colour display of 132 
            x 176 pixels for enhanced image display. Super stylish and 
            ergonomically designed, the X70 neatly folds up to just 87x47x24 mm 
            making it small enough to fit in the palm of the hand like a jewel. 
            The X70 offers a 16-tone polyphonic ringer with tones that sound 
            almost as good as the original song. The phone has a built-in 110k 
            pixel digital camera and full multimedia functions enables users 
            take rich colour photos. It is also equipped with MMS, Bluetooth and 
            IrDA to exchange richer content.</font></p>

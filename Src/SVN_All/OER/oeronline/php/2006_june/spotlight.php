<br>
<img border="1" src="spotlight1.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="86">Auto accessory market in Oman is sailing smoothly at a steady pace. The growth 
of the accessory market segments such as tyres, batteries, lubricants and 
sunshades is in direct proportion to the growth in the vehicle volume. In the 
present scenario, the tyre-trading sector in Oman is experiencing a healthy 
growth over the last couple of years while the lubricant and battery segments 
are witnessing a moderate growth. And when it comes to sunshades, there is a 
perennial demand the world over. The overall market scenario in the Middle East 
mirrors a similar trend.<br>
<br>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have traditionally been a 
profitable market for pan-nation auto car manufacturers and its accessory 
makers. European manufacturers have always dominated the lubricant industry 
world over with very few originating from Japan, and Middle East like the UAE 
and Oman. Similarly, the battery segment has brands coming in mainly from Europe 
and lately from countries like Indonesia, South Korea or Saudi Arabia with an 
indigenous brand from Oman. Unlike the above two, Oman has only tyre-trading 
industry as there is no rubber production in the country. Neither does the 
country have indigenous sunshade makers. <br>
<b><br>
Wheels of fortune</b><br>
Fortune on the wheels rolls in with a delay in any given international 
automotive market. A brand new car will need its first change of tyre only when 
it has travelled the initial distance of about 50,000–80,000 km depending on the 
model, the quality of the battery and brand of tyres installed and the purity of 
the lubricant running the engine. <br>
<br>
The growth rate of the tyre trading industry can be gauged only 2-3 years after 
an increase in car volume. In 2004, the registered car park figure stood at more 
than 500,000. By the end of 2005, the number has gone up by more than 30,000 
cars since then. According to the market estimates, the figure will go up 
further by about 10,000 cars in 2005-2006. <br>
<br>
The speculation is that it will maintain the upward curve for some more time to 
come. Demand definitely is double the supply both in the Middle East region as 
well as in Oman specifically. International tyre brands rule the roost in Oman 
with no indigenous brands. The consumer has a wide choice from top brands like 
Michelin, Pirelli, Hankook, Yokohama, Bridgestone, Good Year, Toyo, Falken, 
Kumho and Continental among others. Other GCC countries viz., Qatar, Kuwait, 
Bahrain and Dubai are also experiencing a similar growth trend. <br>
<br>
Besides being influenced by the increase in car volume, tyre consumption is also 
affected by the usage and maintenance. Middle East being the hot seat for a 
longer duration of summer season than the rest of the world, tyres are one 
accessory that bear the brunt of burning temperatures. A few good thumb rules 
can take care of the untimely change of the accessory ensuring good value for 
money to the consumer.<br>
<b><br>
Reducing friction</b><br>
In the Middle East, the lubricant industry has more than 30 international 
players. A few major companies are Shell, BP/Castrol, Mobil, Total, Elf, Caltex, 
Valvoline, Gulf Oil, ADNOC, Veedol, Crown, Fuchs, and National among others. 
Undoubtedly, Shell Oman has the largest market share in terms of total 
production. While Shell Rotella leads the market in Diesel Engine Oil segment, 
BP’s Visco 2000 rules the game in the Petrol Engine Oil segment. All of them 
cater to the Omani market, which stands at 28,000–30,000 Metric Tonnes per 
annum. With more vehicles on the road and new projects coming up, lubricant 
demand has seen a steady increase in the last couple of years.<br>
<br>
Lubricants market has three major user groups — commercial and industrial 
sectors top the list with consumption standing at 60 per cent, next in line is 
the automotive sector consuming about 35 per cent of the lubes and a mere 5 per 
cent is utilised by the marine sector.<br>
<br>
All the branded engine oils meet the high standards and best performance ratings 
that the new generation of car engines promise. But with the crude oil prices 
shooting up in 2004, the base oil prices experienced a direct impact hitting the 
lubricant sector badly. Not only did the profit margins shrink for the major 
brands, the segment was flooded with a steady inflow of spurious and low-quality 
brands from countries like Indonesia and UAE. Priced at less than half the cost 
of the premium brands, the low-specification brands and look-alikes managed to 
grab an undue albeit small share in the market. Major brands had no choice but 
to cut down on the prices. Brands like Camel, Stanley, and Euro Oil resort to 
using false quality stamps for an entry. <br>
<br>
Sadly, these brands find takers not only in the individual customers but also in 
big organisations many a time, which are cost-conscious. Low-grade oil has 
insufficient additives effecting engine’s functionality and life resulting in a 
potentially high performance car working under par. Branded oils go through 
stringent quality tests to ensure longer engine life and reduced costs on 
maintenance. Sub-standard oils fail on both the counts.<br>
<br>
In mid-2004, the Directorate General of Specifications and Standards under the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry announced a decree as an effort to contain the 
spread of bad oils. The grade set for the import of a lubricant was decided at 
API SJ Quality for petrol engine oil and CF Quality for diesel engine oil. While 
the law is in existence, slack approach in its execution is allowing the 
low-grade lubes to find their way into the country. But the majors in the 
segment are hopeful that soon the loopholes would be identified and plugged 
boosting a healthy market again.<br>
<br>
Apart from the battle with spurious brands, the biggies also have to contend 
with the lubricant re-use market in Oman. The oil that is dumped at the auto 
workshops and service stations is recycled and sold at a cheaper price to the 
cost-sensitive consumers owning handed-down cars or even worse to the people who 
do not care what grade oil goes into their cars. Not only does the recycled lube 
affect the engine’s health, it also causes environmental pollution. Cross 
checking at the user end acts as the best deterrent in the usage of recycled or 
sub-standard lube.<br>
<b><br>
Cranking it up</b><br>
Another important auto accessory is the battery. If cared for properly, 
batteries last a long time offering higher drain intervals to the car. Sadly, 
this accessory remains the most ignored part of the car, unlike the market 
segment itself. <br>
<br>
In the last couple of years, the vehicular volume has seen a steady growth at 
4-5 per cent and the growth of battery market segment is hand in hand with it. 
The European giants have dominated the battery market segment in Oman 
traditionally. The worldwide biggies in the field viz., Exide, AC Delco, Yuasa, 
NBC, GS and Rocket among others, share an almost equal footing in the Omani 
market. The market boasts of only one brand Reem Batteries (Antara) that is 100 
per cent local product. <br>
<br>
A few brands coming in from countries like Indonesia and South Korea offer good 
competition but there are many others that manipulate the market price by 
introducing low-quality gear. Low price is enabled with reduced lead layers in 
the batteries. Moreover, incentives like wider margins to the dealers and auto 
electrical shop owners help them to push their product in to the hands of those 
unsuspecting customer who are more cost-sensitive than quality-conscious. On the 
other hand, many consumers realise the worth of a good battery and pay a bit 
extra to get a fine product.<br>
<br>
But the major brands have a two-fold advantage over the low-quality names. First 
is the reach and the second is the range of products. The premium brands 
invariably build their brands through strong distributor network. The product 
range that standard batteries can afford to manufacture is difficult for the 
sub-standard brands to match. Then there is also brand-loyalty aspect that plays 
a significance role. For example, Reem Batteries (Antara) being an Omani company 
commands a tremendous goodwill among the locals and the brand boasts of the 
widest range of batteries for every kind of a need reaching the customer through 
its strong distributor network. <br>
<br>
Battery care in a hot climatic region like Oman is as important as caring for 
the engine itself. The most common failure on part of the consumer is checking 
the water level in the battery. Even the auto experts are at fault in this 
aspect. In peak summers, batteries need to be checked for the water level at 
least once a month, so that it does not drain half way through its lifetime or 
midway to an important meeting in the searing heat. While buying a new battery, 
especially the dry charge cell, the consumer should wait for the mandatory 
period of thirty minutes before installation. This is because the lead acid that 
has been added to it requires time to charge the battery. This way the drain is 
increased minimizing falling rate. Another most common failure witnessed is 
ignoring company specification to use a suitable size of the battery. It should 
match the ampere requirement of the vehicle giving you value for money. If a 
consumer finds his car refusing to crank first thing in the morning, it is an 
indication that either the battery or other electrical parts need to be checked 
for their functionality immediately. <br>
<b><br>
Cool Effect</b><br>
Globally and in Oman, the market leader in sunshades is Germany-based V-Kool. 
With a presence in more than 25 countries, the premium brand claims to block 
infra-red by 94 per cent, UV rays by almost 99 per cent while keeping visibility 
clear at 73 per cent. Locally, the brand competes with names from India, USA and 
China; like Teejan, Ziebart, Solar Guard, Johnsons, Amcool and Emcool. The 
low-grade brands work on the concept of absorbing the heat and harmful rays 
while the premium brand reflects, cutting out on the root cause itself.<br>
<br>
Total glass surface area of a car and the type of film chosen dictate the cost. 
For a standard-size full car, a good sunshade will cost minimum RO 100 while a 
low-quality film can be as low as RO 3. The market leader offers five types of 
warranty on car sunshades. With zero maintenance and Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 
at 230+, V-Kool is tested and approved by Directorate General of Specifications 
and Measurements under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. <br>
<br>
A little care and attention to your car and its valuable innards go a long way 
in ensuring a cool and comfy ride. Who then cares if the sun chooses to beat it 
down hard! Come summers, we are ready for you.<br>

best practices on car-care</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
By RITWIK SINHA <br>
</b><br>
<b><img border="1" src="spotlight2.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="100"></b>Going by the popular perception, your car or vehicle is just like any other 
inanimate object of utility which is the prime function of engine, battery, 
radiator, carburetor, tyres, hundreds of other small components and most 
importantly the command of your hands on its steering. But scratch the surface 
and one can well notice the trends wherein a car or a vehicle could display the 
trends of an animated object — at least, when it comes to care and maintenance.
<br>
<br>
Like human beings, cars do respond to change in climatic conditions differently 
(for instance, battery could drop low in winters and summers can adversely 
affect the cooling system of the vehicle) and like them they also require 
adequate care to stay in top shape and gear. Needless to say, like for human 
beings, there are also globally tested prescriptions to keep cars in fine 
fettle. Following are some of the finer points of this prescription: <br>
<b><br>
Engine should be properly tuned</b><br>
One of the basic rules to keep a car in top gear is that its engine should 
always be properly tuned. For this, the car needs to be regularly checked. An 
out of tune engine can adversely affect the performance of a car especially when 
it comes to the consumption of the fuel. For instance, a simple misfiring plug 
can cause a reduction in the mileage of the car by a whooping 30 per cent. An 
out of tune car also reduces the life of the engine which simply is the heart of 
the vehicle. Therefore, this point should not be missed at any cost. <br>
<b><br>
Periodic replacement of air filters</b><br>
This is another important clog of auto maintenance process. Engine air filter 
often clogs with dirt, dust and bugs putting unwarranted pressure on the car 
engine. It can also make the vehicle less fuel-efficient. Several studies have 
demonstrated that replacing a clogged air filter improve the fuel efficiency of 
the vehicle by over 10 per cent. It is, therefore, <br>
<br>
advised to get your car’s oil and air filter replaced as specified in the 
owner’s manual (normally after 3000 miles). Moreover, engine air filter should 
be checked at each oil change and if it is showing signs of erosion, then it 
should be replaced immediately. <br>
<b><br>
Always use right oil</b><br>
Studies reveal that a car stays in top shape if its owner were to use the oil 
manufacturer’s recommended grade of motor oil. For instance, because of some 
misconception many car owners opt for premium gasoline when the advised fuel for 
their vehicle is lower-octane gasoline. This only results in loss of precious 
money without making any difference to the performance of the car. The best 
remedy therefore is to use oil specified by the vehicle manufacturer. Another 
option is to opt for motor oil with the words “energy conserving” on the API 
performance label as this grade of oil contains friction-reducing additives. <br>
<b><br>
Keeping a constant tab on air pressure</b><br>
This is a small but crucial exercise. Driving on under-inflated tires is not 
good for your car as it puts unnecessary pressure on several other important 
components including the engine. It also reduces the fuel efficiency of your 
cars by as much as 15 per cent. Furthermore, tires’ life get affected in a major 
way. It is, therefore, advised to check the air pressure of your vehicle’s tires 
at least after every fortnight and if the pressure is on the lower side, then it 
should be immediately taken care of. It is recommended to check tire pressure 
when tires are cold. An ideal time to do it is in the early morning after the 
car has been lying idle in the night. <br>
<b><br>
Fixing the fuel cap</b><br>
Not attaching enough importance to the task of tightening of fuel cap after the 
tank has been filled is a common mistake which majority of car owners make. But 
it has some very serious consequences. It results in the loss of a staggering 
147 million gallons of gas annually on global basis. The rationale is simple: 
fuel and especially gas fuel evaporate if the cap has not been tightened. It is 
recommended that all car owners should lay the required emphasis on this point 
or else they will be contributing that colossal loss pool. <br>
<b><br>
Proper parking space</b><br>
It’s a must for all car users that they should make provision for proper parking 
space for their vehicles. The ideal way would be to have a garage to park your 
vehicles. If the car is parked in a garage, it will stay warm in winter and cool 
in summer. But in case, you are space starved and can’t have a proper garage for 
your vehicle, then the alternative is to <br>
park the vehicle in the shade of a building or a tree. If the car is left 
exposed to sun light, then there are chances that fuel may gradually evaporate 
because of the heat. Also, excessive heat of the sun can affect the cooling 
system of the car.<br>
<b><br>
Cleaning of fuel system</b><br>
Fuel system deposits accumulated over a period of time often result in lowering 
the performance capability of an engine. The mileage of the vehicle also goes 
down. But it can be taken care of by adding a fuel system cleaner to gas tank 
after every oil change (or after every 5,000 kms) which enhance engine 
performance and fuel economy.<br>
<br>
The above-mentioned seven tips are applicable for all seasons and are basic 
rules which should be always followed. However, there are other sets of 
supplementary prescriptions as well to keep your car in fine shape. For 
instance, its maintenance during summers when many of us prefer to go out on 
vacations but summer heat pose several problems. Following are some tips to 
ensure that car continues to deliver smooth performance even during those 
scorching summer months: <br>
<b><br>
Check the coolant</b><br>
To check the coolant, wait until the engine is cool before unscrewing the 
radiator cap. If the rubber gasket inside the cap is cracked or brittle, it 
should be replaced immediately. Top off the coolant at the overflow reservoir, 
not at the radiator. <br>
<b><br>
Inspecting radiator hoses</b><br>
For this also, wait until engine is cool. Carefully check the ends of hoses to 
find out cracks or corrosion because they can result in leaks. In extreme summer 
situations, spongy hoses are advised. However, if any crack is noticed in 
radiator hoses, then it should be replaced immediately. <br>
<b><br>
Battery Inspection</b><br>
Contrary to popular belief, summers can inflict greater damage to a car battery 
than winters. Therefore, before embarking on a long trip in summers, one should 
minutely judge the battery condition. If its in a rusted condition, then it 
should be cleaned by applying a mixture of baking soda and water. One should 
also ensure that the battery terminals and hold downs are tight. <br>
<b><br>
Examining starting and charging system</b><br>
This again is a vital element of auto care during summers. If the under-hood 
temperature is on a higher side, then it can result in short-circuiting of car’s 
starter and alternator. But this is a test which can’t be done at home by an 
average car user and therefore it is advisable to visit a car station where it 
can be checked in a few minutes. This examination, however, is a must and can be 
ignored only at the peril of inviting troubles in a remote location. <br>
<br>
Going by the suggestions of several auto experts, the above-mentioned remedies 
on a cumulative basis are capable enough to keep your vehicle in a top shape 
irrespective of season variations and give you what you solely desire from it — 
the utmost moving comfort on the road. On second thoughts however, there is this 
parting word of advise — always pack an emergency kit that includes water, 
jumper cables, flares, a flashlight, equipment to change a tire, and a first aid 
kit whenever you decide to get behind the wheels irrespective of the fact 
whether you are going for a short or a long trip.<br>

Few tips to enjoy a safe &amp; comfortable journey<br>
With the onset of summer, we get to see a lot of concerned motorists scampering 
for tyres in order to avoid getting stranded in the sweltering heat with a flat 
tyre. Given below are a few do-it-yourself tips<br>
• Select tyres with correct speed rating and load capacity<br>
• Maintain recommended tyre pressure — even in spare tyres<br>
• Inspect your tyres periodically for foreign objects like glass, gravel etc.<br>
• Always check tyre pressure when tyres are cold. <br>
• Timely removal of tyres from service (Tread wear indicators on the tyres serve 
as a guide)<br>

<b>By Monalisa Nayak </b><br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="spotlight3.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="129">Majority of modern day vehicle owners today are aware of a vehicle requiring 
proper maintenance for functioning well but yet very few of them are conscious 
of certain vital subjects of maintenance like lubricants. Not many know what 
lubricants are, what its main functions are and what kind of lubricants they 
should use. <br>
<br>
Different types of engines require different types of lubricating oil depending 
on the age of the car, the type of car, the driving conditions and whether the 
car has a diesel or petrol engine. Car lubricants play four major roles — they 
control friction and wear in the engine, they protect the engine from rusting, 
they cool the pistons, and they protect the engine oil stored in the sump from 
combustion gases. Moreover it also helps to absorb some of the harmful 
by-products of combustion, and to transfer heat from one part of the engine to 
another. <br>
<br>
Using good lubricants will provide the motorist with the following benefits: <br>
• Easy starting <br>
• Better fuel consumption resulting from lower friction <br>
• A cleaner engine as a result of high-disperancy detergents <br>
• Reduced oil oxidation and resultant oil thickening <br>
• Lower oil consumption<br>
• Reduce wear protecting against scuffing<br>
• Excellent rust and corrosion protection for your engine <br>
<br>
A modern contemporary three box car has thousands of parts and well over 1,000 
parts of them are synchronised to move together within extreme tolerances. Under 
such demanding conditions the role of lubricants can never be ignored or over 
emphasised. <br>
<br>
For many of a vehicle’s components, the lubricant plays a vital role as a design 
element. Because wherever there is relative motion between machine components in 
contact, specialty lubricants reduce wear and tear, alleviate friction, and 
enhance the functioning of the component concerned. Some 75-95 per cent of a 
typical engine lubricant is made up of a base oil - a mineral oil that has come 
directly from a refinery. These base oils can naturally contain straight or 
branched chains of hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon molecules with aromatic rings 
attached, or these chains can be produced by further chemical reactions of the 
base oils. Of all lubricants, engine oil is the most important. It keeps all the 
deposit forming material in suspension and gets rid of them by oil filter, or 
draining out at proper intervals. <br>
<br>
The remainder of the lubricant comprises a variety of additives, which are used 
to improve performance. Typically these include anti-wear additives, corrosion 
inhibitors, antioxidants, detergents, dispersants, antifoam additives, and large 
polymer molecules known as viscosity modifiers, which are added to improve the 
viscosity variation of the lubricant with temperature. <br>
<br>
Indeed, the viscosity is the most significant physical property of a lubricant. 
The way in which it varies with temperature, shear rate and pressure determines 
to a great extent how the lubricant performs in an engine. But the chemistry of 
the lubricant is also important: it must be resistant to oxidation and it must 
be able to “lay down” a protective film to combat wear and tear where metallic 
contact is inevitable. Lubricants fall into two broad categories — monograde and 
multigrade — depending on whether their viscosity changes significantly with 
temperature or not.<br>

Summer heat is on and we take all possible care against the fiery sun with 
expensive and efficient sunscreens and ultra cool sunglasses. But what about our 
vehicles? Especially, in a hot region where most people travel by car? Taking 
care of your car during summer is of primary importance. Moreover, because AC is 
on high most of the time the car engine takes a toll. The sun also makes the car 
interiors seem like a hot sauna bath and zaps fuel from gas tank. The best way 
to avoid burning up of the fuel and also all inconvenience is by using a good 
quality sunshade.<br>

Love your tyres!</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>

<br>
<img border="1" src="spotlight4.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="74">When did you last check your car tyres? Can’t remember? Well, it is pertinent to 
remember that the only contact that your car has with the road are the four 
pieces of tyre. No matter how good you are as a driver or how good the 
performance of your vehicle is, your tyres will always affect your vehicle’s 
traction to the road. <br>
<br>
Tyres, like any other part of your car, need to be looked after. Apart from 
saving time and money, if your tyres are sub-standard in any way, they can 
severely affect your cars stopping and handling ability in emergency situations. 
All cars are different. Whether it needs high performance tyres for greater 
handling or smooth and silent tyres for the family car, one should go for tyre 
care on regular intervals.<br>
<br>
These tips are simple things that you can do to make sure that you get the most 
out of your tyres in terms of safety and longevity.</font></p>
<ul dir="ltr">
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Tyres should have a 
  minimum of 1.6mm of tread across the central three-quarters of the tyre.
  </font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Check the correct 
  pressures against the manufacturer’s recommendations given in the vehicle 
  handbook. Different driving conditions require different pressures.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Adjust tyre 
  pressures as necessary — including the spare.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Clean dirt from 
  around the valves and fit valve caps all round. Always ensure that dust caps 
  are applied tightly to each tyre valve. Dust caps prevent dirt and moisture 
  entering the valve mechanism causing damage and also prevent sudden tyre 
  deflation through the valve. </font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Remove stones and 
  other foreign objects from the tyre tread.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Have the steering 
  wheel alignment corrected if front tyres show signs of excessive or uneven 
  wear.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Examine brakes if 
  tyres show signs of wear through wheel locking.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Have front wheels 
  and tyres rebalanced if there are signs of vibration, wheel wobble or patchy 
  tyre wear.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Do not check 
  pressures while the tyres are warm. Tyre pressures should only be checked when 
  the tyre is cold this is due to the tyre heating up when in use and causing 
  increased air pressure, which in turn will give an incorrect air pressure 
  reading.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Do not overload 
  your vehicle as this puts excessive strain on the tyres.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">When undertaking 
  long journeys, especially at speed on motorways, examine the tyres both before 
  and during the journey.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Avoid harsh 
  braking, fierce acceleration and fast cornering.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The steering wheel 
  of cars with power-steering should not be turned while stationary.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Avoid driving over 
  or scraping against sharp edgings or other raised obstructions</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">After driving on 
  rough, uneven, unmade ground or over ground littered with debris, check the 
  tyres to ensure that no foreign objects have become trapped in the tread and 
  examine the sidewalls for cuts or bulges. <br>
  • Ensure you have the correct tyres for your car. Avoid “mixing” tyres.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Tyres may wear 
  quickly if consistently subjected to hard braking or rapid acceleration.
  </font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Be careful when 
  parking to avoid tyre damage.</font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Have your tyres 
  fitted by a qualified tyre technician. </font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Do not use sealants 
  to repair punctures. The use of sealants may invalidate tyre warranties.
  </font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Don’t forget the 
  spare tyre. </font></p></li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Another main 
  contributor to reduced tyre life is speed. When a tyre spins the sidewall 
  flexes generating heat. The faster you drive the faster the tyre flexes, thus 
  generating more heat.</font></p></li>

By MONALISA NAYAK</b><br>
<br>
<b><img border="1" src="spotlight5.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="143"></b>Imagine yourself stranded in deserted area because your car battery has given 
up? A battery problem is probably the last thing one can dread off while 
driving. Though not much is required to do when it comes to battery care if not 
properly handled or taken care of, car batteries can cause serious injuries and 
damages. Batteries require simple and
routine maintenance in order to work properly over their lives. <br>
<b><br>
Battery HygiEne</b><br>
Keep the top of the battery clean. Dirt becomes a conductor, which drains 
battery power. Further, as corrosion accumulates on battery terminals it becomes 
an insulator, inhibiting current flow. It is advisable to check the condition 
and charge of the battery. Always replace the battery with one that has a higher 
rating than the original. Dispose your car battery properly. Car batteries are 
highly recyclable items with their plastic and lead components. Batteries also 
contain large amounts of harmful lead and acid solution which call for proper 
disposal in order to protect our environment. <b><br>
<br>
Battery Safety</b><br>
Charging a battery releases hydrogen — this gas is explosive and the slightest 
spark can cause the battery to explode, Therefore give the right mixture of gas 
and air. Ventilate it well. The sulphuric acid of the battery can severely 
injure eyes and skin. Never tip or drain a battery. Batteries are heavy always 
be careful while lifting or replacing. <br>
<br>
Do not jumpstart a vehicle by connecting its battery with a different voltage 
battery from another car. There were also occasions where fires and explosions 
were caused due to short-circuiting of the batteries. Start the car with the 
good battery and let it continue to run at high idle for a while to allow the 
dead battery to be recharged and to warm its electrolyte. Check and make sure 
that the “terminals” of your car battery are protected with insulating caps. 
This is to protect your car battery from short-circuiting. Moreover, to ensure 
that your battery lasts long, make sure the electrical system is charging at the 
correct rate; overcharging can damage a battery as quickly as undercharging. If 
your battery is the type that needs to be topped off, check it regularly, 
especially in hot weather. Add distilled water when necessary. <br>
Tips to keep your car battery going If you get behind the wheel only to discover 
that your car’s battery has given up you may be able to get your vehicle started 
by dropping two aspirin tablets into the battery itself. The aspirin’s 
acetylsalicylic acid will combine with the battery’s sulfuric acid to produce 
one last charge. But after this don’t forget to rush to the nearest car station.<br>
<br>
A mixture of baking soda and warm water can also help eliminate the corrosive 
buildup on your car’s battery terminals. Take 3 tablespoons baking soda and 1 
tablespoon warm water scrub them clean using an old toothbrush and wipe them off 
with a wet towel and dry with another towel. Once the terminals have completely 
dried, apply a bit of petroleum jelly around each terminal to deter future 
corrosive buildup. <br>
<br>
If your car battery showing sign as if there is no more life in it give it a 
little more life try this out . Dissolve about an ounce of epsom salt in warm 
water and add it to each battery cell. This can help.<br>
<br>
Why is that in a winter morning the car battery gives up? Low temperatures 
increase electrical resistance and thicken engine oil, making the battery work 
harder. Before winter starts, disconnect the terminals and clean them&nbsp; with 
a wire brush. Reconnect, then smear with petroleum jelly. The jelly will prevent 
corrosion and help keep the battery cranking all winter long.</font></p>

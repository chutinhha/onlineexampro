                        Oman Football Association’s (OFA) signed its first-ever 
                        corporate sponsorship deal with Gulf Air. As per the 
                        multi-million dollar sponsorship deal, the airline will 
                        be the official sponsor for the national senior, 
                        Olympic, Under-19 and Under-17 teams. “As part of our 
                        smart airline, successful business strategy, we are 
                        already helping to build a better future for Oman by way 
                        of our financial contribution to the country’s economy,” 
                        said Gulf Air President and Chief Executive, James

                        <br>
                        “This has been achieved by increased flights through 
                        Seeb Airport and initiatives such as the new maintenance 
                        centre and the worldwide call centre in Muscat. Now we 
                        want to turn to more leisurely pursuits and build 
                        something that is even closer to the heart of most 
                        Omanis — the national football teams.” Hogan added that 
                        football is the national sport of Oman. “What better way 
                        to fulfill one’s commitment as the national airline than 
                        to put significant financial and logistical support 
                        behind the OFA? We hope that we can help the senior team 
                        climb the world rankings and at the same time foster 
                        exciting new footballing talent across the Sultanate.”

                        advanced project, Omantel adopted the MPLS through the 
                        BankNet, which guarantees the safety and confidentiality

                        with sales touching over US$100 million. Half of the

                        townhouses and villas and expected to be completed in

                        bought by the expatriates mostly based in the Sultanate, 
                        according to company officials. The first release 
                        witnessed buyers from 24 different nationalities. The 
                        construction of units in the first release is expected

                        our development. While we were always confident about 
                        the success and the interest it would generate, to

                        facilities and easy access to other locations, besides

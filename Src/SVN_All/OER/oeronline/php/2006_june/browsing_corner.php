            most other business books that analyse or theorise about business 
            strategies and empires, it’s very important to understand, at the 
            very beginning, that this book is not about all those aspects! ‘Pour 
            Your Heart Into It’ by Howard Schultz and Dori Jones Yang is a book 
            that reads quickly. When you finish reading it, you sit back and 
            wonder what indeed was it all about then. That’s when you will need 
            to go back to the Prologue and you’ll get the entire message in a 
            nutshell: <br>
            <b>“Care more than others think wise.<br>
            Risk more than others think safe.<br>
            Dream more than others think practical.<br>
            Expect more than others think possible.”</b><br>
            This is exactly what the Chairman and CEO of Starbucks did to build 
            his company, literally, one cup at a time. It is the story of the 
            progression of a coffee house started by two teachers and a writer — 
            three people passionate about coffee and a chance meeting with 
            Schultz who dreamt about turning this passion into an international 
            business enterprise. He persuaded them to rope him in despite their 
            initial reluctance to let their small enterprise grow. Later, they 
            dropped out to remain more in line with what they had originally set 
            out to do while Schultz dreamt even more to make Starbucks the way 
            we see it today.<br>
            <br>
            Initially, Schultz dreamt and persuaded people but then to make it a 
            reality, he risked a steady job in a large firm to move to something 
            he felt was his calling — his destiny. As he went along the road to 
            pursue the vision he had brought to life, he took care of the people 
            who helped him make it all happen — from the topmost executives whom 
            he hired to the ‘baristas’ who actually linked him with his 
            customers, who in turn appreciated and savored every cup that was 
            brewed at Starbucks. As a result, he expected nothing but the best 
            from himself, his staff and business. <br>
            <br>
            The bottom line was quality at the cost of everything else - quality 
            of the product, service and ways of doing business. Nothing was 
            spared when it came to looking after his people. He is even candid 
            about hiring people better than himself to do the jobs he couldn’t, 
            and then, leaving it entirely to them.<br>
            <br>
            He narrates in detail how he maintained the standard during testing 
            times when the market was hit by frost in Brazil and how he had to 
            hire the best in the business to help him make coffee drinking seem 
            pleasurable and romantic. What seems effortless is indeed hard work 
            round the clock — read the book and find out what a host of 
            professionals had to contribute to build the Starbucks brand that 
            has created a revolution in the coffee business. <br>
            <br>
            Problems such as growth versus quality - inevitable to every 
            business — were tackled carefully. Starbucks steered from its core 
            business of serving coffee only brewed by their own home-trained 
            baristas to hotels, airlines and fast food chains — all initially 
            against its main principle of brewing coffee one cup at a time and 
            that too on home turf alone. Now, music, ice cream and more is made 
            available at Starbucks. Dogmatic thinking proved disastrous and 
            flexibility was valued to eventually please the customer.<br>
            <br>
            For a book that rambles along, and doesn’t claim to be a 
            conventional business book, nevertheless illustrates the story of a 
            phenomenal company and its constant goal to balance passion with 
            profit. Budding entrepreneurs, sales and marketing teams as well as 
            companies on the threshold of expansion plans can greatly benefit. 
            So, go ahead and pour your heart into it!<br>

                  Orin’s approach couldn’t be more different than mine. Orin is 
                  quiet and reserved and almost always in his shell, like a 
                  tortoise, and he works steadily and faithfully at problems 
                  until they get solved. He always carries a pen and notebook in 
                  his pocket, and when he wears his big-framed glasses, he looks 
                  as wise as he is. When a dilemma arises, I tend to make a snap 
                  judgment and want to take action immediately, while Orin 
                  listens calmly, gathers all the information he needs and 
                  ponders carefully until he comes up with a logical, reasoned 
                  response. <br>
                  <br>
                  When Orin came to us in 1990, Starbucks was not a 
                  professionally managed business. We were totally 
                  entrepreneurial with an approach Eric Flamholtz, one of our 
                  consultants, characterizes as “Ready, Fire, Aim.” To his 
                  credit Orin didn’t make a big show of turning Starbucks into a 
                  professionally managed company. If he had, it probably would 
                  have spooked me and many others inside the company. Instead he 
                  led by example. Thanks to his equanimity and his leadership 
                  skills, the organization began gravitating naturally towards a 
                  more balanced approach- just as we got big enough to need it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Very subtly, he created an environment in which there was for 
                  the first time a strong appreciation of the disciplines 
                  necessary to run a large and profitable business. He built an 
                  organization by recruiting seasoned professionals in the key 
                  areas that had to be strengthened in the company: management 
                  information systems, finance, accounting, planning, legal 
                  affairs and supply-chain operations. <br>
                  <br>
                  However warily I began to recognize that in building 
                  discipline into a company, its possible to not only honor the 
                  creative process but also make it stronger and more dynamic. 
                  By strengthening the foundation and structure of the company, 
                  we can stop wasting time reacting to small problems and 
                  instead devote our attention and resources to new products and 
                  new ideas. With a clearer strategic direction, we can focus 
                  our creativity on issues that matter for Starbucks in the long 
                  term.</font></td>

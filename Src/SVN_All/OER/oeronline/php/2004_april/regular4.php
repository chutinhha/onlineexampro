            </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>By Joseph E. Stiglitz<br>
            Price: RO5.500<br>
            (Paperback) 288pp<br>
            Penguin Books</b></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The author surely 
            needs no introduction, former Vice-President of the World Bank, 
            Chief Economic Advisor in the Clinton Administration and a Nobel 
            laureate. When you pick a book written by such an intellectual and a 
            luminary, you are in for a seriously good read.<br>
            <br>
            Globalization &amp; its Discontents is an insiders view on the major 
            economic decisions that have influenced the financial system and 
            markets around the world. From Bretton Woods to the WTO, Stiglitz 
            traces the flawed economic policies and system, a part of which, he 
            was himself. How International institutions like the IMF and the 
            World Bank operate, their priorities and the clout the US treasury 
            holds, as the largest shareholder of the IMF. From the limited 
            successes of economic policies in Uganda, Ethiopia and Botswana, the 
            vulnerable position of East Asia on its capital and financial market 
            liberalizations, the turmoil in post-Yelstin Russia moving from 
            communism to a market economy. Stiglitz criticises the IMF, giving 
            the many dimensions of Globalization, its problems and shortcomings. 
            He suggests immediate reforms and putting in place a strong global 
            financial institution to avoid the economic disasters of tomorrow.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is truly wonderful work by Stiglitz, an authority on 
            international
            <img border="0" src="bookglobal.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="120">finance 
            and its institutions, with his first person account on what actually 
            happened. Definitely a highly recommended read to one with a 
            penchant for economics and anyone in the financial services sector. 
            At 250+ pages Globalization &amp; its Discontents is absolutely 
            top-drawer stuff! </font></p>

            Managing Change<br>
            </font></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">By Robert Heller<br>
            72 pp (paperback)<br>
            Price: RO4.100</font></b></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">You can learn all 
            you need to know about change from Robert Heller's book Managing 
            Change. Change is inevitable. It is the same as Darwin's theory of 
            evolution. In today's competitive world, people and organisations 
            have to constantly adapt and evolve to the business demands else 
            they face the threat of losing their customers/profitability. 
            Employees should support and encourage change while management 
            should listen to staff needs and provide solutions to the best 
            possible level. <br>
            <br>
            In most cases, change is brought about by young blood. Those who 
            come in with new ideas have to contend with older staff that tend to 
            resist management changes. The changes should be introduced to staff 
            with care and proper training /orientation should be given so they 
            accept the changes with an open mind. <br>
            <br>
            Rewarding employees that are performing well combined with 
            organising workshops and informal gatherings can go a long way in 
            boosting morale and building team spirit. Management should 
            implement change if they do not undertake such activities often. 
            However, sometimes organisations introduce processes and systems 
            that hinder the development of staff. Change should not be unbiased 
            and not favour a select few and transparency should be maintained. 
            In the unfortunate event of retrenchment, the organisation should 
            empathise with the affected employees and assist them in searching
            <img border="0" src="bookreview.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="120">for 
            alternative employment/sources of income. <br>
            <br>
            These and many more important tips are contained with the book 
            Managing Change, which is worth reading.</font></p>

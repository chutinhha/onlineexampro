                    When Qtel, the Qatari telecommunications company, began its 
                    expansion plans its first stop was the Sultanate of Oman, 
                    where the telecom sector was opening up. Two of Qtel’s trusted 
                    lieutenants – Khalid Ibrahim A Al Mahmoud and Ross Cormack 
                    – were sent to Oman as COO and CEO respectively. Their express 
                    brief was to compete against a well-entrenched incumbent operator. 
                    In December 2004, Omani Qatari Telecommunications Company 
                    was registered in the Sultanate and in March 2005, Oman’s 
                    second mobile operator was launched under the name Nawras 
                    and the rest as they say is telecom history.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Making a mark</b><br>
                    Says Mahmoud, “I joined Nawras in February 2005. It was a 
                    good opportunity for me as I grew from being a senior manager 
                    in Qtel to the rank of a COO. But it was also a challenging 
                    responsibility. We were taking on an existing mobile operator 
                    and my only experience was with a monopolistic company (in 
                    Qatar). Here, it was a new team, different country and a new 
                    culture. It was a completely different learning experience.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Mahmoud’s voice doesn’t betray the tough initial days at Nawras 
                    where he had to prove the trust reposed in him. Speaking matter 
                    of factly he says, “Today, Qtel has operations in 17 countries 
                    but in those days, Nawras was its first foray outside Qatar 
                    and all the energies and focus of the parent company was on 
                    us. Ross and myself were the only connection to Qtel and we 
                    had to fit the factual information into a business plan and 
                    communicate it to the group in Qatar. Trying to strike a balance 
                    between their expectations and the challenges here was a tough 
                    ask, but we managed it.”<br>
                    Over the past three years, things have changed dramatically. 
                    The Qtel Group expanded its geographic footprint from two 
                    to 17 countries within the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. 
                    The parent company has over 57 million customers and Qtel 
                    directors no longer have the bandwidth to focus solely on 
                    Nawras.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Vast experience</b><br>
                    Mahmoud began his career with Qtel in 1989 after getting an 
                    information technology degree from the US. Since then, he 
                    has garnered more than 16 years <img border="0" src="images/img53.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="5" width="147" height="250">of 
                    well-rounded experience in the telecom sector assuming positions 
                    of increasing responsibility, ranging from IT, ISP and data 
                    management to product management and marketing in Qtel. Mahmoud’s 
                    diverse experience has stood him in good stead at Nawras. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As senior manager, product management and marketing at Qtel, 
                    Mahmoud’s responsibilities were to oversee management, development 
                    and marketing of all wireline services including international, 
                    national, data, Internet and many other ancillary products. 
                    After the Emir of Qatar signed up with a number of American 
                    universities in the late 90s to establish their campuses in 
                    Doha, and with the oil and gas sector experiencing a boom, 
                    the pressure was on Qtel to establish a world class telecom 
                    network both fixed and mobile and to put Qatar on the world 
                    map, recalls Mahmoud.<br>
                    <br>
                    “With my education background in IT, I worked as IT divisional 
                    manager at Qtel and was responsible for the IT strategy and 
                    introduced significant improvements in critical IT areas such 
                    as billing and customer care. Later, as the head of the Internet 
                    and data services business unit, I oversaw the implementation 
                    of Internet services and overhauling the data network operations,” 
                    says Mahmoud. <br>
                    <br>
                    Corporate business was part of Mahmoud’s profile in Qtel and 
                    as such he was exposed to understanding and segmenting corporate 
                    consumers – the most demanding segment in the business. Segmenting 
                    of the market, means getting more details and knowing what 
                    really drives demand. From a supporting role it means knowing 
                    the technologies and the financial aspects and packaging of 
                    services according to market demands. His experience in this 
                    key role played a big role in his nomination as COO of team 
                    Nawras by Qtel. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Team work</b><br>
                    In Nawras individual roles are not exactly boxed. It’s true 
                    teamwork here informs Mahmoud while saying that members of 
                    the executive committee share their views about strategic 
                    elements and operational management of the company. As per 
                    the brief from Qtel, they have to meet their targets and these 
                    could be financial, operational or HR driven. Sometimes it 
                    is very challenging to meet all of these because of a number 
                    of factors like market forces, tough regulatory environment 
                    and the constant need to keep abreast with the latest technology, 
                    all of which weigh in and have to be delicately managed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Usually mobile operators have a very short term focus and 
                    this is a common pitfall that many of them fall into due to 
                    the pressure of meeting short term objectives. “As such most 
                    mobile operators are driven by efficiencies and commercial 
                    strategies. But if you don’t have a long term vision you will 
                    have to do major technology shifts that are very costly and 
                    they hit your business.” Fortunately, says Mahmoud, Nawras 
                    has got the latest mobile network and is constantly adopting 
                    new technology. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Convergence imperative</b><br>
                    Being a technology man at heart, Mahmoud forecasts the convergence 
                    of mobile and fixed line services. With Nawras having bagged 
                    the second fixed line operator licence, he says that Nawras 
                    has already gone through the technology shift, adopting what 
                    is known as soft core switches which can handle fixed and 
                    mobile services seamlessly. <br>
                    <br>
                    The 3G and wimax (fixed wireless service) are merging into 
                    what is known as LTE (long term evolution). This technology 
                    means that voice and data will converge into one element and 
                    your mobile phone, fixed line and EPABX systems will all function 
                    as one. When you are in the office, you will use your landline 
                    and when you are out, it will be your mobile. The roadmap 
                    is there for all this and it will be out within three-to-five-years. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Talking about the fixed line services, Mahmoud underscores 
                    the unique working culture at Nawras saying it has resulted 
                    in exemplary performances. The company has always achieved 
                    its targets much ahead of schedule. “We have managed to have 
                    a successful operation and we plan to replicate it with our 
                    fixed line services as well,” he says. Qtel and Nawras are 
                    both driven by the overall group vision and reflect the local 
                    vision of their respective countries. In Oman, His Majesty’s 
                    Vision 2020 is the roadmap and Nawras wants to make sure that 
                    the Sultanate is not lagging behind in the telecom sector.<br>
                    <br>
                    Referring to the fixed line launch, he says, “All the projects 
                    are in place and a lot of investments have gone in. I think 
                    we will be rolling out our fixed line services in mid-2010. 
                    We will be having a separate building for the technical and 
                    IT staff somewhere close to our present office. We are of 
                    course expanding and growing our mobile segment as well.”<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>No time to steer</b><br>
                    His skills as a trained pilot may have played a part in steering 
                    a company like Nawras. Mahmoud holds a flying licence for 
                    a small plane. His cherishes the desire to fly a plane from 
                    Doha to Muscat someday. “One of things that I would like to 
                    do is to come to Oman in one of those small planes. But it 
                    is very tedious as you cannot fly in a straight line through 
                    Abu Dhabi and Al Ain. A small plane cannot travel at a very 
                    high altitude and flying close to the mountains is very dangerous. 
                    If you have to avoid those mountains, it may take more than 
                    four hours,” he says in jest.<br>
                    <br>
                    Presently, he commutes every week between Doha and Muscat 
                    over weekends. While in Doha he lavishes time and attention 
                    on his seven children. He specially cherishes the moments 
                    spent with his youngest two children who are twins. When asked 
                    whether he has any other leisure activity, Mahmoud avers that 
                    he has hardly any time for himself. The only time he gets 
                    is, when he goes to the gym to unwind after a stressful day 
                    at work.<br>

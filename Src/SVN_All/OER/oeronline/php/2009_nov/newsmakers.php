                    It is not everyday that one comes across a banker, who has 
                    bridged the gap between business and art. Akshay Kumar Parija, 
                    board member and executive director, Blue Lines Shipping Pte 
                    and a banker of repute for over two decades in Oman and Kuwait 
                    has managed to close this chasm successfully. The Living Ghost 
                    a movie produced by Parija has been winning accolades on the 
                    international film festival circuit. At the 6th Independent 
                    South Asian Film Festival, in Seattle, Washington it made 
                    it to the final 16 movies which were selected for screening 
                    from 105 submissions. It went onto win an award for being 
                    the most thought provoking movie at the festival. Prior to 
                    this it received a seal and certificate of appreciation for 
                    taking on the sensitive issue of tribal exploitation at the 
                    32nd Cairo International Film Festival.<br>

                    <b>Showing gratitude </b><br>
                    Says Parija, “I have a background in promoting art and culture 
                    from Orissa, my native state in India. This movie is a way 
                    to express my gratitude for my state.” The movie is also an 
                    effort to highlight the sensitive issue of tribal exploitation 
                    and to expose Oman on the film making market. Parija’s views 
                    found an instant c<img border="0" src="images/img76.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="180" height="232">onnect 
                    with Prashanta Nanda, a veteran film personality, who has 
                    produced and directed Oriya, Bengali and Hindi movies over 
                    a 50 year old career. Nanda was on the lookout for a script 
                    that dealt with a meaningful subject. Moreover, he needed 
                    a producer who would be committed to such a project. Ashok 
                    Suvarna, executive director, NPA events came on board to take 
                    care of the marketing and distribution aspects of the movie.<br>
                    <br>
                    The meeting of minds led to swift action – the movie went 
                    on the floors in January 2008 and was canned by September. 
                    “We applied to seven film festivals and got selected for three. 
                    The movie was not included in the New York Art Film Festival 
                    and the Los Angeles Asian Film Festival due to a single day’s 
                    delay,” says Parija. The impact created by the movie at Seattle 
                    won it a DVD contract of 250,000 copies. Out of these 200,000 
                    DVD’s will be sold in the US and the remaining 50,000 would 
                    be marketed in Europe. The proceeds of the sales will go to 
                    the people whose cause has been showcased in the movie. Parija 
                    is working on a second venture which would showcase Oman. 
                    Having worked in BankMuscat and National Bank of Oman for 
                    19 years, Parija feels that one should be passionate about 
                    ones work and strive for complete satisfaction of one’s customers. 
                    Having swapped customers for viewers, Parija is bringing the 
                    same zeal to movie making now.</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>

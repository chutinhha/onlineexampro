                    <b>The property market in Oman has found the balance it needed 
                    after being rocked by the global financial crisis, says Christopher 
                    J Steel, Managing Partner, Savills Oman. A report by Visvas 
                    Paul D Karra</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Oman’s property market has turned around quicker than expected. 
                    And as it becomes cle<b><img border="0" src="images/img65.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5" width="179" height="217"></b>ar, 
                    that Oman’s general economic stability will attract more businesses, 
                    the likelihood of continued expatriate arrivals is very sure 
                    – with several larger multinational companies in the UAE now 
                    actively looking at Oman as their alternative regional base. 
                    Consequently, the property market in Oman is looking at an 
                    upward curve with demand for housing – residential and commercial 
                    – being strong. It is in such a positive climate, that Savills 
                    Oman is consolidating its position as the leading player in 
                    the Sultanate’s real estate market and opened its office in 
                    mid 2009.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>International service</b><br>
                    Christopher J Steel, managing partner, Savills Oman, is confident 
                    that the company in Oman will replicate the success seen in 
                    other countries. He says: “By bringing some of Oman’s most 
                    experienced real estate professionals under the umbrella of 
                    the Savills global network, we strive to provide international 
                    quality service levels with a personalised and local flavour.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Says Steel, “Savills, in my mind, is the most appropriate 
                    real estate agent for Oman because it has an international 
                    department that does nothing other than coordinate all international 
                    enquiries and referrals and things like that. If a person 
                    comes to Savills Oman and says he wants to buy a house in 
                    New York or elsewhere, the international department will help 
                    him.” Savills in Oman provides a range of agency and advisory 
                    services including property sales and leasing, valuations, 
                    research and development consultancy and operates under the 
                    strict codes of conduct of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
                    Surveyors (RICS).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Dealing properly</b><br>
                    Steel, was with Hamptons for over 11 years in Oman, before 
                    he joined Savills, which is globally ranked as the number 
                    four real estate company in the world. “There is a need for 
                    a good old-fashioned company like Savills to operate in Oman. 
                    Moreover, the company is publicly listed and has 18,000 people 
                    working in 244 offices all over the world. But the most attractive 
                    thing of Savills is the company ethos, “We deal with property 
                    – properly”.<br>
                    <br>
                    Talking about the challenges amidst the market dynamics in 
                    the context of the global downturn caused chiefly by the US 
                    sub-prime crisis, Steel observes that property market went 
                    through a period of boom from 2007-08 and it was entirely 
                    speculation-driven. A combination of greed factors by the 
                    buyers and over-ambition and overpricing by sellers brought 
                    down the market.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, Steel points out that property prices are inching 
                    upwards but you cannot generalise it everywhere as prices 
                    will vary from place to place. Ultimately, the recovery is 
                    led by end-users, he avers. As far as business is concerned, 
                    he says it is the best time to begin. The market is down but 
                    it is back to where it was before the speculative period of 
                    2007 and 2008. It is back to normal. During that period, you 
                    could sell 200 units in just under half an hour. Now, you 
                    don’t wait for people to buy but you have to go and sell. 
                    You don’t wait for the phone to ring. But you have to call, 
                    says Steel while underscoring the need for companies to change 
                    their working strategy to get people into the buying mode 
                    once again.<br>

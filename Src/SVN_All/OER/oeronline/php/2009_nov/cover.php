                Fund were being c<img src="images/img35.jpg" width="250" height="250" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">autious 
                about reentering the market in a big way till May 2009, but then 
                as the market kept on posting gains they realised that the MSM30 
                had hit its tipping point. “Sitting on cash would have meant losing 
                out on opportunities,” says Sankar Kailasam, senior vice president, 
                asset management, GBCM. The fund deployed back its funds on the 
                Muscat Securities Market (MSM), giving subscribers a 30 per cent 
                return till September 2009. The sprint in the market is unmistakable 
                – the MSM 30 index closed on September 30 at 6,572 points – a 
                year-to-date gain of 20.8 per cent. The month also saw the index 
                touching a yearly high of 6,737 on September 27. Contrast this 
                with the low of 4,223 points recorded on January 21 and one gets 
                a feel of how the tables have turned.<br>
                <br>
                Says Nabeel Sultan, director, Jawad Sultan Enterprises and a chartered 
                wealth manager, “The worst is definitely over, the markets have 
                bottomed out and are going higher.” Better oil prices and aggressive 
                government spending have been the fundamental drivers of the stock 
                market rally. The impact of oil prices on the fortunes of GCC 
                economies can hardly be overstated. GCC stock markets have a 0.86 
                – 0.92 per cent correlation to oil prices. So when the price of 
                black gold fell from a high of<img src="images/img36.jpg" width="250" height="234" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left"> 
                $147 per barrel in July 11, 2008 to $31 per barrel on December 
                23, 2008, markets across the region took a beating. The Abu Dhabi 
                Securities Market (ADX) fell by 47.4 per cent, Bahrain Stock Exchange 
                (BSE) by 34.5 per cent, Kuwait Stock Exchange by 38 per cent, 
                Dubai Financial Markets (DFM) by 72.4 per cent, MSM30 by 39.72 
                per cent, Doha Stock Market (DSM) by 28.1 per cent and Saudi Arabia’s 
                Tadawul index by 57 per cent in 2008.<br>
                <br>
                As oil prices hit new lows, there were doubts about the long term 
                viability of carrying forward all the mega development projects 
                that were being implemented. The price of oil also cast a shadow 
                on the revenue generating capability of these economies. Says 
                Mustafa Ahmed Salman, chairman – CEO, United Securities, “The 
                panic that was created by the crash in developed markets accelerated 
                selling pressure and caused foreign funds to withdraw their money 
                from the markets.” This over reaction saw stocks falling to multi-year 
                lows during the year.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The turnaround</b><br>
                As oil prices recovered from the 30’s to the high 60’s and 70’s 
                by mid 2009, confidence in GCC economies returned slowly but steadily. 
                On October 21, 2009, oil touched a yearly high of $82 per barrel 
                – a scenario that few could predict three months back. Contrast 
                this with Oman’s yearly budget estimate of oil prices at $45 per 
                barrel and the comfort zone for the economy becomes clear. The 
                fact that oil production for the January-August period at 802,300 
                barrels per day was 6.8 per cent higher than the corresponding 
                period of the previous year added to government revenues. The 
                average price of oil for the period works out to $49.90 per barrel, 
                higher than the budgeted price. “The persistent weakness in US 
                dollar and higher demand for heating oil in the winter months 
                in the west are likely to keep oil prices firm. “Demand for oil 
                continues to remain strong in Asia led by China and India,” says 
                N Anil Kumar, vice president head of research, corporate research, 
                FINCORP. Oil prices continue to hold firm at around $70 per barrel 
                which augurs well for the average price in the months ahead.<br>
                <br>
                The additional revenues have helped the government to continue 
                spending o<img src="images/img37.jpg" width="250" height="311" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">n 
                infrastructure and development activities, giving a fillip to 
                the economy. In all, the government awarded contracts worth RO2.3bn 
                by mid-October 2009 compared to RO2.9bn awarded for the year 2008. 
                Analysts expect another RO3.2bn worth of projects to be awarded 
                in the next few months, taking up the value of such projects to 
                RO5.5bn by the end of 2009. This figure is the highest amongst 
                GCC economies. “Considering that bulk of these contracts would 
                still be a mobilisation phase, Oman as an economy would start 
                2010 with a healthy order backlog,” says K Gopakumar, general 
                manager, head of wholesale banking, BankMuscat.<br>
                <br>
                As the private sector grapples with a slowdown due to the global 
                financial crisis, the government has been providing the requisite 
                stimulus to the economy. It has followed an expansionary fiscal 
                policy with investment expenditure for the first seven months 
                of the year going up by 18 per cent year-on-year (yoy) and total 
                expenditure by 4.4 per cent. This has been achieved despite a 
                24.7 per cent drop in total net revenues during the same period 
                in 2009. Says Mustafa Ahmed Jaffer, executive director, Vision 
                Investment Services, “Unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus 
                and quantitative easing were announced and markets reacted positively 
                to the efforts. Investor sentiment improved remarkably and markets 
                grew increasingly immune to the flow of bad news as governments 
                across the board carried out concerted effort to stem the rot 
                in financial markets.”<br>
                <br>
                In a direct intervention the government established a RO150mn 
                Market Stabilisation Fund in February 2009. As investors developed 
                cold feet, the fund injected liquidity into the markets. Says 
                Hassan Ali Jawad, managing director, United S<img src="images/img38.jpg" width="400" height="184" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">ecurities 
                and chairman of the board, MSM, “The mandate of the fund was to 
                stabilise the market, by rotating liquidity. It helped brokerage 
                companies which in turn helped the stock market, proving to be 
                a win-win situation.” The fund has played its part in soothing 
                frayed nerves on the MSM.<br>
                <br>
                As a flanking strategy, pension funds also started taking positions 
                in the market. The price support provided by the these agencies 
                encouraged retail investors and institutions to re-enter the market. 
                Once oil prices touched $70 per barrel, foreign investors too 
                started investing on the GCC markets. The share of foreign investors 
                during the January-September 2009 period stood at 23.14 per cent. 
                The value of shares bought by foreign investors during the first 
                nine months of 2009 reached RO441.6mn comprising 25.11 per cent 
                of the total value.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Striking ba</b><b>ck</b><br>
                The signs of a strong recovery are underway – cement sales continue 
                to be robust indicating strong construction activity. Oman Cement 
                sales during the first six months of 2009 grew by 17.5 per cent 
                to 1.13 million metric tonnes (mt). Raysut Cement’s sales stood 
                at 1.58 million mt, a yoy increase of 13.3 per cent. Imports through 
                Port Sultan Qaboos has been improving sequentially indicating 
                enhanced demand and the continued inflow of expatriates indicates 
                job creation in the economy.<br>
                <br>
                The corporate sector’s numbers took a beating in Q4’08 and Q1’09 
                thanks to the sub-prime crisis and its aftermath. As the Sultanate’s 
                economy gains strength the ru<img src="images/img39.jpg" width="300" height="223" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">b-off 
                effect on companies is unmistakable. Consolidated profit of the 
                MSM30 companies stood at RO126mn in Q2’09 – 13.4 per cent higher 
                compared to Q1, 2009. Analysts expect these numbers to improve 
                during Q3’09, due to sequential gains and the base effect of a 
                poor Q3’08. For instance – profits of the MSM30 in the second 
                half of 2008 stood at 24 per cent of the first half of 2008 and 
                33 per cent of the profits reported in the first half of 2009. 
                Better balance sheet has strengthened customer confidence in the 
                index. Says Jaffer, “Second quarter results aided the recovery 
                as companies saw their earnings stabilise after dropping precipitously 
                in the earlier quarters. Investors who were on the sidelines entered 
                the market on initial signs of recovery and institutions adopted 
                a more aggressive asset allocation strategy.” Anticipation of 
                better corporate earnings is bringing back investors to the market.<br>
                <br>
                An additional factor shoring up corporate profits is the fact 
                that most listed companies have their own portfolios on the MSM 
                and as the stock market recovers, these gains are getting reflected 
                on their balance sheets. Says Ritesh Jesrani, head of research, 
                Al Madina Financial and Investment Services Co, “In 2008 several 
                companies had portfolio investments on the MSM, when the crash 
                happened it eroded their profits, but now as the markets recover 
                such investments are generating secondary sources of income for 
                these companies.”<br>
                <br>
                As the MSM hit new lows in Q4’08 and Q1’09, the prices of various 
                stocks saw a steep revision. A number of investment holding companies 
                started trading well below their book value. For example, Transgulf 
                was trading at a price-to-book value (P/BV) of 0.3 times, Oman 
                Emirates Investment Holding Company hit a P/BV of 0.4. Stocks 
                like Oman Cables fell to as low as RO0.380. The average volume 
                of daily trade on the MSM was down to RO3mn-4mn a day in Q1’09 
                (from RO10-12mn a day). And the index started trading at a price 
                earnings ratio (P/E) of six compared to 11 times earnings during 
                the first half of 2008. Says Kailasam, “With inflation expected 
                to rise and the asset revaluation that happened on the MSM, investors 
                have started coming back to the stock market.” The rerating of 
                stock prices made valuations more attractive. A fall in share 
                prices inadvertently gave a fillip to high dividend yielding stocks 
                like Oman International Bank (OIB), Oman Flour Mills etc.<br>

                &nbsp;As the markets lost steam, the monthly trading volume fell 
                from RO197.4mn in September 2008 to RO55.1mn in December 2008. 
                The fall in volumes saw a reversal in January 2009 and picked 
                up momentum from March 2009. Says Lo’ai Badie Bataineh, DGM – 
                Investment and Development, Head of Investment Management Group, 
                Oman Arab Bank, “We have seen new investors coming back to the 
                market. A number of them were attracted by dividends as Oman has 
                historically been one of the best dividend yield markets” The 
                return of investors helped market capitalisation to increase by 
                2.68 per cent to RO9.3bn in September 2009.<br>
                <br>
                Says Kumar, “The industrial sector started the recovery during 
                the first half of 2009. Whenever an economic recovery materialises, 
                commodities tend to rally first.” The trend manifested during 
                the first half of the year as cement, copper and aluminium prices 
                skyrocketed. For example copper prices shot up from $3000 per 
                tonne to $6500 a tonne. The boomerang in commodity prices coupled 
                with better demand helped the industrial sector. The industrial 
                index of the MSM now trades at a P/E ratio of 16 times, compared 
                to the MSM’s average of 12.8; banking sectors: 12.7 and services: 
                10.7 times.<br>
                <br>
                The banking sector which boasts of a number of bellwether stocks 
                has been through a rough patch. Large cap banks suffered as they 
                became risk averse and cut down on <img src="images/img43.jpg" width="300" height="224" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">corporate 
                loans. Their international portfolios took a hit as global markets 
                plummeted. If these were not bad enough came the news of BankMuscat’s 
                RO66mn ($171mn) exposure to Saudi Arabia’s troubled Saad Group 
                and Ahmad Hamad Al Gosaibi Group &amp; Brothers. Says Gopakumar, 
                “That (Saad and Gosaibi exposure) was a bit of a setback to us, 
                but we are well provisioned for any such bad debts.” NBO and BankDhofar 
                were the other banks which suffered impairment loses due to loans 
                given to the Saudi groups. Adds Riyad Ammar, brokerage manager, 
                Al Madina Financial and Investment Services Co, “The margins of 
                bigger banks have been under pressure due to conservative lending. 
                If the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) insists on more provisioning 
                due to their recent exposures then their net profits would be 
                affected further.”<br>
                <br>
                The limited exposure of the Sultanate’s banking sector to overseas 
                borrowing though proved to be a silver lining. This coupled with 
                CBO’s regulatory initiatives like opening up of two windows worth 
                $2bn ensured that there was enough dollar liquidity available. 
                While the first window was in the form of a swap, the second window 
                did direct lending against eligible promissory notes. The Central 
                Bank also reduced the reserve requirement from eight per cent 
                of deposit liabilities to five per cent and eased lending ratios 
                from 85 per cent to 87.5 per cent from January 1, 2009. These 
                measures ensured that there was no liquidity crisis in the local 
                market. Government deposits in the commercial banks in September 
                stood at RO1.2bn.<br>

                There is enough money in the economy for short term lending (three-to-six 
                months), but medium to long term lending (over a year) is still 
                difficult to come by. As governments in developed countries increase 
                their regulatory requirements, calling for bigger provisioning 
                in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the lending capability 
                of banks is expected to be under pressure. As dollar borrowing 
                has just started bankers feel that it will take six months to 
                a year for things to stabilise. So the banking sector is still 
                not completely out of the woods and this finds an echo in their 
                market multiples.<br>
                <br>
                Says Kailasam, “Banks need a productive asset and so they have 
                to lend.” Aware of this banks are scouting for credible parties 
                to lend to. A consortium of six local banks – BankMuscat, National 
                Bank of Oman, BankDhofar, Bank Sohar, Ahli Bank and Oman Arab 
                Bank alongwith State Bank of India inked a project financing deal 
                with Italy-based international engineering contractor Saipem and 
                AFCONS, an Indian infrastructure firm for a contract to design 
                a deepwater bulk jetty at the Port of Sohar, in September 2009. 
                The total investment in the project, including a dredging component 
                to be undertaken by Van Oord of the Netherlands amounts to RO95mn.<br>
                <br>
                Despite the downturn, the banking sectors clout on the MSM is 
                apparent – in terms of the total number of shares traded during 
                the nine months of 2009, the banking and investment sector was 
                the most active reaching 2.6bn shares which represents 53.5 per 
                cent of the securities traded and RO733mn in turnover. This was 
                followed by the services and the insurance sector with 1.3bn traded 
                shares and RO584mn in turnover. The industry sector stood at 944mn 
                shares and RO415mn in turnover.<br>

                Oman has been able to weather the global financial whirlwind with 
                equanimity as it was largely decoupled from international markets. 
                Says V Gowribalan, portfolio manager with a reputed holding company, 
                “If one is trying to justify the fall in the Oman market by linking 
                it to the global market, such an argument is not tenable. Oman’s 
                correlation to the developed markets is only 0.7 per cent. In 
                2008-09 the correlation was 0.87 per cent.” In terms of oil exports, 
                57 per cent of GCC exports goes to developing countries like China, 
                South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. As these countries are still on 
                a growth mode, the Sultanate does not have much to be concerned 
                about.<br>

                The Asian markets rally started in March 2009 as commodity prices 
                recovered. China started buying commodities in a big way and that 
                helped sentiment all across. The commodity build helped equity 
                markets to move up and genuine buyers came back. Big stimulus 
                measures deployed by governments across the globe helped almost 
                all asset classes t<img src="images/img44.jpg" width="280" height="274" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">o 
                rally back. This is vindicated by the positive economic numbers 
                that has been seen in the recent times – Q2’09 GDP data shows 
                that Japan grew by 3.7 per cent; India 6.1 per cent; China 7.9 
                per cent; Brazil 6 per cent. Positive industry expansion data, 
                rising consumer confidence and fall in equity volatility are some 
                of the factors that are aiding this recovery. Emerging markets 
                especially Asian markets have rallied more due to their structural 
                stability. US and the EU though slipped by -1.0 per cent and -0.1 
                per cent respectively during Q2’09. US with its record unemployment 
                of six million (10 per cent of the workforce) will take longer 
                to recover. “Though economies may be decoupled, financial markets 
                are correlated and so one cannot become solvent till the markets 
                become rational,” adds Gowribalan.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;Looking ahead analysts and corporate captains are confident 
                that the MSM will remain positive in 2010. Markets in the region 
                are still trading at 13-16 times earnings, compared to emerging 
                markets which are well above 20 times FY’09 earnings. This offers 
                a good buying opportunity in the GCC markets. Given the positive 
                outlook, equities are expected to generate superior returns vis-à-vis 
                other asset classes and investors <img src="images/img46.jpg" width="270" height="225" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">with 
                a medium to long-term investment horizon could consider buying 
                equities to benefit from the current up-cycle.<br>
                <br>
                They should however weigh their risk-return objectives before 
                investing in equities as they generally suffer from higher volatility 
                over a short time frame. Says Jaffer, “We recommend retail investors 
                to take advantage of the mutual fund route for getting exposure 
                to the market and avoid speculating on individual stocks. Additionally 
                they can spread their investment over a three-to-six months period 
                to take advantage of dollar cost averaging.” If you are still 
                sitting on cash, it may be a good time to re-enter the stock markets.

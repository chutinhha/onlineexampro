                    IT automation proces</b><strong><img src="images/img34.jpg" width="250" height="376" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right"></strong><b>s 
                    in the Sultanate. How much ground has been covered by the 
                    system?</b><br>
                    There has been a strong learning curve that has gone into 
                    the one-stop-shop. We developed the idea a few years back 
                    but since it involves business process reengineering and coordination 
                    between various ministries, procedures, looking at documents, 
                    we took it step-by-step. As a start we posted people from 
                    six different agencies which are involved with approvals and 
                    permits – the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI), the 
                    Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Manpower, 
                    Royal Oman Police, Muscat Municipality and the Ministry of 
                    Environment at the MOCI.<br>
                    <br>
                    From the experience we worked on simplifying the process, 
                    enhancing the data, digital intervention and put in place 
                    a new business process mapping that would reduce the time 
                    taken. Instead of getting approvals sequentially we are now 
                    getting them simultaneously. Those activities in which foreign 
                    investors come and ask for approvals have been classified 
                    according to international ISSAC standards. We devised a single 
                    window clearance with a front office and a back office. The 
                    front office communicates with the investor, it’s the channel 
                    through which an investor comes and submits his applications 
                    with the relevant documents. This data gets captured on a 
                    digital platform, gets scrutinised and then gets passed on 
                    to the back office. The six agencies then simultaneously look 
                    at the information and process their approvals.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What have been the major achievements in the process till 
                    date?</b><br>
                    We have succeeded in doing various things. Capturing the da<img src="images/img91.jpg" width="150" height="173" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">ta 
                    electronically (and immediately) was a big milestone for us. 
                    Second, we have been able to cut down on the time and process 
                    taken. Classifying the information according to ISSAC standards 
                    was another great milestone. We have created a communication 
                    link between these various agencies. In the second phase of 
                    development we are looking at the possibility of outsourcing 
                    some of these activities to third party agencies. As a start 
                    we will be outsourcing some of these activities to kiosks 
                    run by young Omanis or by Sanad clearance officers in 2009-10. 
                    We have identified ten kiosks or clearance offices and have 
                    started by giving them one kind of transaction pertaining 
                    to reserving commercial names and this has been going on for 
                    a year. For example, the front office could be given to them 
                    and they would capture the data, scrutinise it and process 
                    it to the back office on behalf of the government or the one-stop-shop. 
                    The other is to have some sort of a self service, wherein 
                    one can apply online.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How much of the process time has been cut short?</b><br>
                    The one-stop-shop serves the mass audience and everyday investments 
                    that come in. This constitutes 85-90 per cent of the investments 
                    that come to Oman or are generated by local investors. Out 
                    of this 72 per cent of the applications get processed the 
                    same day, 13 per cent get approved within two days and the 
                    rest takes more than that because they involve a visit by 
                    a government agency. Earlier this would take a week to ten 
                    days, moreover it was a cumbersome process. </font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><b>

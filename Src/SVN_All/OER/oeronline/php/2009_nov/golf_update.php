                    Singh, nicknamed “The Big Fijian”, is a Fijian professional 
                    golfer who was number one in the official World Golf Rankings 
                    for 32 weeks in 2004 and 2005. He has won three major championships 
                    (The Masters in 2000 and the PGA Championship in 1998 and 
                    2004) and was the leading PGA Tour money winner in 2003, 2004 
                    and 2008. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame 
                    in 2006. He won the FedEx Cup in 2008.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Looking back </b><br>
                    An Indo-Fijian of Hindu background, Singh was born in Lautoka, 
                    Fiji and grew up in Nadi. A resident of Ponte Vedra Beach, 
                    Florida, he is known for his meticulous preparation, often 
                    staying at the range hours before and after his tournament 
                    rounds working on his game. Growing up, he played snooker, 
                    cricket, football, and also the island’s most popular sport, 
                    rugby. He is the son of Mohan Singh, an airplane technician 
                    who also taught golf. Growing up, he admired the swing of 
                    Tom Weiskopf, using it as an early model for his own. Two 
                    years after turning professional, in 1984, Singh won the Malaysian 
                    PGA Championship. However, his career was plunged into crisis 
                    after he was suspended from the Asian Tour in 1985 over allegations 
                    he doctored his scorecard. It was alleged that he lowered 
                    his score from one over to one under in order to make the 
                    cut, but Singh denies this, saying that in any case, it should 
                    only have resulted in disqualification from the event rather 
                    than a ban. He then saved the money he needed to resurrect 
                    his career and began to re-enter tournaments.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Big league</b><br>
                    In 1989, Singh won his first European Tour title at the Volvo 
                    Open Championship in Italy and <img src="images/img67.jpg" width="147" height="262" hspace="8" vspace="6" border="0" align="right">finished 
                    24th on the European Tour Order of Merit, putting his early 
                    struggles firmly behind him. He won four times in 1989, at 
                    the Volvo Open di Firenze, Ivory Coast Open, Nigerian Open 
                    and Zimbabwe Open. He also finished tied for 23rd at the British 
                    Open. He won on the European Tour again in 1990 and did so 
                    twice in 1992. He also won several tournaments in Asia and 
                    Africa in this period. Singh entered the PGA Tour in 1993, 
                    winning his first PGA Tour event, the Buick Classic in a playoff 
                    over Mark Wiebe. That victory led to his being named the 1993 
                    PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. After being hampered with back 
                    and neck problems in 1994, he came back to win the Buick Classic 
                    again in 1995 as well as the Phoenix Open. After playing well 
                    in 1996 (but with no victories), he won both the Memorial 
                    Tournament and the Buick Open in 1997. In 1998, Singh was 
                    victorious at the PGA Championship at Sahalee in Sammamish, 
                    Washington. He followed this up by winning The Masters in 
                    2000, with a three-stroke victory over Ernie Els.<br>
                    <br>
                    Singh has won 22 times on the PGA Tour since turning 40 - 
                    beating the record previously set by Sam Snead. He is the 
                    second man to reach $60 million in PGA Tour career earnings, 
                    after Tiger Woods. His 34 career victories are the most on 
                    the PGA Tour by a non-American player and place him 14th on 
                    the all-time list. He has spent over 500 weeks ranked in the 
                    top 10 of the Official World <br>
                    Golf Rankings.</font></p>

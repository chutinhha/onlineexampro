                    within the kingdom. it also helped saudi arabia’s accession

                    <br>
                    Saudi Arabia has reasons to celebrate economic achievements 
                    on regional and international levels. Two global reports issued 
                    by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
                    (UNCTAD) and the World Bank awarded Saudi economy the best 
                    points amongst Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Middle 
                    East and North Africa (MENA) at large. Also, the kingdom’s 
                    own statistics point out to outstanding budgetary results 
                    and economic activities.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Growing inward investments </b><br>
                    According to World Investment Report 2009, issued by Unctad, 
                    inward foreign direct investments (FDI) into Saudi Arabia 
                    amounted to $38.2bn in 2008. This translates into an increase 
                    of $13.8bn or a growth rate of 36 per cent in a single year.<br>
                    <br>
                    Much to its credit, Saudi Arabia stands out in the region 
                    when it comes to attracting FDI. The figure of $38.2bn represents 
                    42 per cent of total FDI attracted by West Asian countries, 
                    which include GCC states, Turkey and Iran. The other top regional 
                    recipients, namely Turkey and the UAE attracted FDI worth 
                    $18.2bn and $13.7bn, respectively. To be sure, the size of 
                    FDI has increased substantially over the last few years, amounting 
                    to $24.3bn in 2007, $18.3bn in 2006 and $12bn in 2005. Conversely, 
                    inbound FDI averaged merely $245mn for the period spanning 
                    1990 to 2000.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Welcome FDI</b><br>
                    The extraordinary progress partly reflects sustained economic 
                    reforms, which were strengthened by the official drive to 
                    join the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Saudi Arabia acceded 
                    to WTO in December 2005 following a decade-long protracted 
                    negotiation. In particular, credit must be extended to liberal 
                    measures encompassing foreign investment law (FIL) that was 
                    enacted in April 2000. The FIL grants foreign firms the right 
                    to own majority stakes in companies within the kingdom. The 
                    law also allows foreign banks to operate in the form of locally 
                    incorporated joint stock companies or as branches of international 
                    financial institutions. In addition, Saudi Arabian General 
                    Investment Authority (Sagia), which looks after foreign investments, 
                    has put in place a one-stop-shop application process. Also, 
                    Sagia offers a 30-day deadline for decisions on investment 
                    applications.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Doing business</b><br>
                    Such practices partly explain the outstanding result that 
                    Saudi Arabia achieved in World Bank’s Doing Business 2010 
                    report. The report ranks Saudi Arabia at number 13 amongst 
                    183 economies, the best within the entire Mena region. In 
                    fact, the report ranks Saudi Arabia as the best country in 
                    the world on the variable of registration of property. Clearly, 
                    this reflects ease of registration process. However, the report 
                    notes that Saudi Arabia has difficulty with regards to enforcing 
                    contracts, ranked as 140 globally. Certainly, Saudi authorities 
                    must overcome enforcement of contracts problem in order to 
                    send a positive signal to prospective investors. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>GDP growth</b> <br>
                    In addition, the kingdom’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 
                    by a hefty 22 per cent in 2008 in current terms on the back 
                    of exceptional rise of oil prices in the first seven months 
                    of the year. GDP at current prices or market exchange rate 
                    include effects of oil price rise but exclude inflationary 
                    pressures. Oil price had reached a record $147 per barrel 
                    in July 2008. The petroleum sector, which includes crude oil 
                    and processing plus gas, is uniquely significant in the Saudi 
                    economy by virtue of comprising three quarters of exports, 
                    two thirds of treasury revenues and more than one third of 
                    the GDP. To be sure, Saudi Arabia is largest oil exporter 
                    in the world followed by Russia. One such negative point here 
                    is that Saudi economy is over-dependent on the petroleum sector. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    According to figures released by Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency 
                    (Sama), the country’s GDP reached a record $468bn in 2008, 
                    undoubtedly the largest in the Arab world. However, estimates 
                    by the Economist Intelligence Unit put the GDP in purchasing 
                    power parity rates at $591bn. In short, Saudi Arabia’s GDP 
                    is second to none in the Arab world. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Budgetary surplus</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="images/img69.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="5" width="250" height="167">Still, 
                    there are other extraordinary economic results. Saudi Arabia’s 
                    budget posted a record surplus in 2008. Actual revenues increased 
                    by a hefty 144 per cent from $120bn to $293bn. Also, real 
                    total expenditures rose by nearly 25 per cent to $136bn. As 
                    a result, the kingdom posted a record $157bn surplus. In retrospect, 
                    Saudi Arabia registered surplus of $47bn in 2007 and $71bn 
                    in 2006, regarded the highest at the time. For good reasons, 
                    Saudi authorities made proper use of the surplus to reduce 
                    outstanding debt to 14 per cent of the GDP, down from 19 per 
                    cent in 2007. Often times, debts limit economic freedom of 
                    nations. In addition, the year 2008 produced other outstanding 
                    results notably that of per capita income rising by 19 per 
                    cent to $18,847. Still, the EIU put per capita income on PPP 
                    basis at $23,692. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia has a long way 
                    to go to attain per capita on par with Qatar, a fellow GCC 
                    member state. EIU estimates put Qatar’s per capita income 
                    in 2008 at $67,348 in market prices but $58,635 in market 
                    and PPP basis, reflecting inflationary pressures.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Addressing unemployment</b><br>
                    Yet, the authorities are expected to capitalise on the outstanding 
                    economic results notably budgetary surplus to address a pressing 
                    problem, namely unemployment. Total jobless figure stands 
                    around 11 per cent. By one account, unemployment rate is close 
                    to 25 per cent amongst females.<br>
                    <br>
                    Undoubtedly, the government cannot overlook the unemployment 
                    problem amongst locals not least due to critical demographics. 
                    Some 38 per cent of Saudis are below the age of 14 and thus 
                    many youths would enter the job market in the years to come 
                    looking for suitable employment opportunities. The challenge 
                    relates to ensuring availability of job opportunities that 
                    meet the expectations of locals notably females with regards 
                    to working conditions and remunerations. Saudi authorities 
                    need right economic choices in order to address outstanding 
                    challenges.</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>

                    <b>AOFS has been rated as the No.1 non-banking financial company. 
                    What has made it achieve this?</b><br>
                    It is not just one simple factor but a collection of factors. 
                    You cannot build such quality in a business model over a short 
                    period of time. It is our entire philosophy which includes 
                    our belief and value system, the kind of transparency we have 
                    and how that then translates into technical things like – 
                    how your capital structure should be and what kind of manpower 
                    and HRD policy you should have. It is also not the first time 
                    that we have been rated No.1, in fact we have been consistently 
                    been rated as the best, so I believe that it has more to do 
                    with our philosophy; our management processes; the structure 
                    of our capital; the quality of business and service that we 
                    provide; the customer service that we have and also the honesty, 
                    transparency and new value added products that we bring. <br>
                    Unless you provide value, a customer will not be interested. 
                    And even if he walks in he will not do so for the second time. 
                    You cannot build a top quality business if your customers 
                    are not coming back and new customers are not walking in. 
                    It is the sum and substance of all these factors as a whole 
                    that determine the success of a business, not just one. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Considering the recent downturn in the automotive industry 
                    and Al Omanya’s reliance on the sector, what has been the 
                    effect of the slowdown on the company?</b><br>
                    There has been an impact but it has been limited, simply because 
                    we anticipated the downturn. We knew that the economy works 
                    in cycles – anything that goes up must come down. You should 
                    structure your organisation efficiently and have the flexibility 
                    to manage this volatility without sustaining a severe impact; 
                    this is the hallmark of a good organisation and it is the 
                    same with us. So, while there has been an impact, it hasn’t 
                    been so great that it destabilises the organisation. Since 
                    we have provided for these contingencies, we will maintain 
                    consistent dividends and earnings.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Has the recent downturn affected the way in which you provide 
                    financing to people?</b><br>
                    Not to a substantial level – business volumes were lower because 
                    people were buying less but this was not severe enough that 
                    the organisation would need restructuring. If we had not anticipated 
                    this scenario and made serious errors in the product lineup, 
                    distribution methods and capital structures then as a consequence 
                    we would have had to make serious amendments. But, we had 
                    a very well developed and well defined product lineup and 
                    we already had a contingency plan for such a situation. As 
                    a result we did not have to make any serious changes in the 
                    way we approach customers.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What is the main purpose of your recent RO20mn bond issue?</b><br>
                    There are three main reasons for it. The first being that 
                    all financing companies have to maintain a capital of RO20mn 
                    by June 2012 and this will help us to achieve the required 
                    paid-up captial. Secondly, what we are issuing is a long term 
                    bond, since we mainly finance long term. Technically this 
                    is called matching the maturities. Thirdly this would help 
                    us augment our long term resources for the company as we believe 
                    there is enough demand in themarket to deploy this kind of 
                    funds. We have a strategy in place which will reduce the down 
                    side risk to the minimum.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What are your fail-safes to prevent problems with money 
                    not being paid back on time?</b><br>
                    <b></b> In <b></b>any business that deals with lending money, 
                    there are certain precautions to be taken. When you take into 
                    account the environment that you are operating in – legal, 
                    financial and cultural; and if you are careful you will acquire 
                    the book of quality assets. In spite of this there will always 
                    be some cases where such contin<b></b>gencies can happen and 
                    when the need arises, these problems will be handled. We pay 
                    particular attention to the business that we write and we 
                    have systems, processes, internal control and credit scoring 
                    systems in place, therefore such problems of delinquency are 
                    at minimum and usually legal recourse is available to recover 
                    such loans. As a matter of abundant precaution, the company 
                    anticipates and provides for such contingencies. The company 
                    is therefore very well positioned to address such issues. 
                    The fact that we have completed several cycles of business 
                    validates our business models.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What is your anticipation of the market next year?</b><br>
                    I believe that, Oman in particular, should be on a growth 
                    trajectory soon. We have not been impacted as much as other 
                    markets outside the region, simply because the country as 
                    a whole is conservative and careful. Economies like these 
                    follow an anti-cyclical fiscal policy which means that in 
                    times when the revenues are low, when the private sector capital 
                    expenditure and consumption falls, it is substituted by much 
                    higher government spending. This is why we have seen projects 
                    of several billion dollars being awarded and as such the sentiment 
                    has improved. We didn’t have any problems with our banking 
                    and financial systems, in fact the government did not have 
                    to come and guarantee the deposits like was done in other 
                    countries. So, as you can see we have had several positive 
                    factors and I believe that at least by the end of next quarter 
                    we should see a moderate growth. It is very hard to state 
                    that the growth of 2008 might occur because for such a growth 
                    the entire world economy has to grow in tandem. In my opinion, 
                    as the oil prices are at a very healthy level, our reserves 
                    are good and there is a lot of construction and infrastructure 
                    spending happening, I think that at least in Oman the worst 
                    seems to be over. <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CC3300">

                    A genuine life-saver<br>
                    </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman recently received 
                    its first batch of the H1N1 vaccine but there have been some 
                    concerns about its safety. Malcolm Xavier Crasta speaks to 
                    Jihane F Tawilah, WHO representative in Oman, to see if these 
                    rumours hold any ground<br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/img28.jpg" width="280" height="310" hspace="8" vspace="3" align="right"> 
                    Since our last article on the H1N1 pandemic (OER, July issue), 
                    the virus has spread quite rapidly worldwide. The latest records 
                    show that more that 2,428 people were infected, with 24 deaths, 
                    as a result of H1N1 in Oman alone. However, major advancements 
                    have taken place in finding a vaccine for the pandemic. Oman 
                    was among the first countries in the region to receive its 
                    share of the doses with more on the way. The vaccination is 
                    an important step in the Sultanate’s strategy to control the 
                    virus before it peaks in the northern hemisphere this winter 
                    around the month of February.<br>
                    <br>
                    Immunisation is one of the most successful methods for preventing 
                    communicable diseases. Risks from intractable diseases that 
                    took millions of lives like smallpox, diphtheria and poliomyelitis 
                    have been reduced as a result of the development of respective 
                    vaccines. Still, there are some communicable diseases such 
                    as AIDS and malaria that represent a challenge to health systems 
                    due to the lack of an effective vaccine against them. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Unwarranted fears </b><br>
                    Says Jihane F Tawilah, WHO representative in Oman, “Unfortunately, 
                    there have been rumours regarding the safety of the vaccine 
                    but the reality is that these are not based on anything scientific 
                    and is simply not true. This unwarranted scare about the safety 
                    of the vaccine is because people don’t have the knowledge 
                    from the right sources.” <br>
                    <br>
                    The process of vaccine production is well established and 
                    in not new, furthermore it is being manufactured by the same 
                    companies that produce other influenza vaccines. “This influenza 
                    vaccine and other vaccines are primarily the same – we are 
                    dealing with the same companies, same methods of manufacturing 
                    and the same production procedure. The only change is that 
                    they have tried to remove one particle which is specific to 
                    seasonal influenza and replaced it with a particle which is 
                    specific to H1N1 for this vaccine to become capable of giving 
                    you the protection required specifically against the disease” 
                    says Tawilah.<br>
                    <br>
                    “We are confident about the safet<img src="images/img29.jpg" width="216" height="209" hspace="8" vspace="3" align="left">y 
                    of all components that are in this new vaccine because all 
                    these have been tested and used for years and we know that 
                    there are no major side effects that result from it,” she 
                    adds. So far there have been 15-20 countries that have started 
                    administering the vaccine since September. China was the first 
                    country to start inoculations followed by others in Europe. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thousands of doses have been given out so far but not a single 
                    case of serious side effects as a result of the vaccine has 
                    been reported to the WHO. “Administering this vaccine should 
                    not cause any adverse side-effects besides what you might 
                    expect from any regular vaccine that you may take – such as 
                    some redness at the region of the injection, some indurations 
                    or tenderness and in rare cases it may give you a headache 
                    or slight fever for one or two days and Panadol is all that 
                    is needed to relieve you of this,” says Dr Tawilah. “This 
                    vaccine doesn’t warrant any worries because even if we know 
                    of potential serious side-effects, these will be very rare 
                    and may occur at a rate of only one-to-two per million, that 
                    is, if it happens at all.”<br>
                    <br>
                    The Ministry of Health decided to start the vaccination campaign 
                    only after receiving the necessary licenses and approvals 
                    ensuring the effectiveness and safety of these vaccines. As 
                    such, it is imperative that the vaccine be taken when required 
                    for two primary reasons. Says Dr Tawilah, “Firstly to grant 
                    yourself immunity from this disease and secondly to prevent 
                    further spread of the disease through you,” says Tawilah. 
                    Do the right thing – protect yourself, your family and your 
                    neighbour.</font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><b><br>

				<b>The announcement that Oman is to invest $5bn in building up 
				its steel industry looks a wise move. The focus on a growing 
				sector in which Oman has some particular strategic advantages 
				could prove an important part of the Sultanate’s diversification 
				programme<br>

				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="economy.jpg" width="125" height="148" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">On September 29, the authorities outlined the investment 
				package, part of broader plan to expand the manufacturing sector 
				that it will eventually account for 15 per cent of GDP by 2020. 
				The export-orientation of the steel production programme fits 
				well with the Sultanate’s broader industrial programme. The 
				government has classified most steel products (including tubes 
				and bars) as “medium value”, the second of its four export 
				categories. This indicates that the sector is “likely to grow 
				rapidly”, and has been targeted for potential support 
				initiatives.<br>
				<br>
				Steel billet production (that is, manufacture of semi-finished 
				cast products such as coils and ingots) is currently in the 
				third category. This means that exports currently earn the 
				country less than RO5mn annually, but that the segment has been 
				earmarked for development and making a larger contribution to 
				earnings in the future. The rationale behind developing the 
				steel sector further is clear enough. Global demand is strong, 
				hence the export focus, but the domestic market is also growing 
				quickly, with the Sultanate expected to consume upwards of one 
				million tonnes by 2010.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="economy1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Strategic advantages</b><br>
				Furthermore, Oman has several competitive advantages on which it 
				aims to capitalise. Not least amongst these are a very 
				favourable business climate and a growing pool of skilled labour 
				(both national and, thanks to the country’s openness, 
				expatriate). Also important is the abundance of energy 
				resources. “Steel production is an energy-intensive industry, so 
				the availability of relatively cheap gas in Oman contributes to 
				the location’s attractiveness,” says Suresh K Goswami, CEO of 
				Sohar Steel.<br>
				<br>
				Given the fact that other Gulf countries also have huge energy 
				reserves and strongly pro-business economic policies, location 
				is perhaps Oman’s trump card. With its major ports outside the 
				crowded Strait of Hormuz and troublesome Bab al Mandib, the 
				Sultanate has unrestricted access to the Indian Ocean and the 
				huge steel markets of South and South East Asia, as well as the 
				smaller but fast-growing economies of Africa. The Sultanate is 
				also building up a transport infrastructure to complement its 
				geographic position and long-term ambitions. <br>
				<br>
				The extension of the Port of Salalah’s current capacity of 
				around 2.5mn twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) to 9mn TEU, the 
				proposed extension of a railway line from Sohar to the 
				industrial centre of Al Duqm, and a motorway from Barka through 
				Sohar to the border with the UAE are three other key projects 
				facilitating transport to and from steel plants and other 
				industrial centres and beyond to external markets. Oman’s 
				growing number of trade deals also makes the country an 
				attractive location for the export-oriented steel sector. 
				Indeed, Rizwan Sajan, Chairman of Danube Building Materials, 
				cited, “The Sultanate’s excellent relations with potential 
				importing countries” as a key reason for his firm’s $13.6mn 
				investment in a new steel plant near Mabella, which was 
				announced the same day as the government’s package for the 
				sector. Dubai-based Danube will import raw materials from a wide 
				range of countries, including China, Turkey, Taiwan and South 
				Korea, to its 4750sqm mill.<br>
				<br>
				Sajan is bullish about the domestic steel market, which he sees 
				as the ideal launch pad for Danube. He said in a statement: “We 
				consider Oman as a key market for our high quality building 
				materials, and with more construction and real estate projects 
				emerging within the Sultanate, this is truly the perfect time to 
				invest significantly in expanding our operations there.”<br>
				<br>
				The Mabella mill is one of a range of steel projects in the 
				Sultanate. Another is Sohar Steel’s new plant near the Port of 
				Sohar. This made headlines earlier in May when it was 
				commissioned to produce 200,000 tonnes per year of continuous 
				cast mild steel billets for Sharq Sohar Steel Rolling Mill, the 
				country’s largest steel rebar producer. Its capacity is scalable 
				to 500,000 tonnes per year, giving Sohar ample scope to meet 
				future demand.<br>
				<br>
				Another project that is central to putting Oman on the world 
				metallurgy map is Shadeed Iron and Steel, the Sultanate’s first 
				fully integrated iron and steel plant. Located at Sohar 
				Industrial Port, this should be producing 1.5mn tonnes of steel 
				after the completion of its first stage later this year, and 
				2.6mn tonnes once the second phase has been brought on stream.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

				<b>Nose diving prices</b><br>
				The outlook for the steel sector remains positive, even after a 
				sharp recent drop in the steel price from around $1630 a tonne 
				in July to $950 in late September (for Turkish steel in the UAE, 
				a fair measure for the region). The fall caused producers across 
				the Gulf, including Sharq Sohar, to scale back production to 
				lower operating costs as well as to reduce inventories and 
				tighten the supply side to bolster the price.<br>
				<br>
				There are several reasons for the fall in steel, including 
				concerns about a slowdown in the global construction industry as 
				projects come on stream and as lending conditions tighten due to 
				the credit crunch. In the Gulf specifically, fears have been 
				raised that a real estate bubble has been created that may soon 
				burst – though the reality seems to be that oversupply may be 
				occurring in some parts of the market while there is strong 
				demand in others (particularly at the lower end – Saudi Arabia 
				and the UAE in particular have substantial affordable housing 
				deficits). There is also considerable evidence that the price 
				fall is in large part attributable to speculators who had pumped 
				up commodities such as steel and then dumped them – demand has 
				certainly not dropped by 40 per cent. The knocking of 
				speculative wind from steel is, in the long run, good news for 
				producers and it should put the industry on course for steadier, 
				more realistic growth rather than a boom-bust cycle. Analysts 
				suggest that regional demand will start to climb steadily again. 
				Imports of rebars are expected to hit 8 million tonnes next 
				year, up from 6.75 million in 2008, indicating that there is 
				plenty of room for Gulf-based producers to expand.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				With India’s economy expected to grow by 6 per cent this year 
				and Africa’s by 6 per cent, according to IMF forecasts, markets 
				overseas also look robust in the medium term at least. Finally, 
				it should be noted that $5bn, while a significant sum, hardly 
				represents Oman hurling all its resources into one industry. 
				Overproduction from a large number of plants seems unlikely, 
				even if demand was to slow down unexpectedly. The Sultanate is 
				not going to flood the market against its own interests. Overall 
				the announced $5bn looks to be a substantial but sound and 
				strategic investment in a sector in which Oman has several key 
				advantages – and private sector players have voted with their 
				feet to support it. </font>

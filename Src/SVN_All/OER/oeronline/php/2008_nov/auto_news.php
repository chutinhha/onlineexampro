				commenting on the all new Pilot Grand-Comfort Cruiser which has 
				recently arrived in Oman. “Honda has a reputation for excellence 
				but this vehicle really does set an exceptional new standard,” 
				Turner adds. “Its key features are comfort, design, power, 
				safety and technology and these are certainly being appreciated 
				not just by the reviewers in the international motoring press, 
				but more importantly by the customers in our showrooms in Oman.” 
				Hamed Al Balushi, salesman at the Wattaya Showroom is in 
				complete agreement. The ride is surprisingly smooth, more like 
				that of a luxury saloon car than the SUV that it actually is. 
				The Pilot has a bold design with powerful front-end styling and 
				its flexible 3.5 litre i-VTEC VCM engine ensures power and fuel 
				efficiency, as well as lowering emissions.<br>

					motoring website for women – evecars.com has named the 
					Jaguar XF ‘Best Executive Car’ in its 2008 honours list. The 
					panel of women responsible for putting the XF and its 
					competitors through their paces were, evecars.com editor 
					Alex Jenner-Fust, Eve magazine’s Rachael Ashley and Jessica 
					Gibson, Autocar’s Vicky Parrott and Eve reader Sarah Thane. 
					Each appraised the cars using five key criteria: Comfort 
					(driving position, space in the rear), Practicality (getting 
					in and out, positioning a child seat), Space (boot volume 
					and ease of loading) Parking and of course the Drive. 
					Commenting on the award, Alex Jenner-Fust, editor of 
					evecars.com said: “For a car that will take you seamlessly 
					from school gates to boardroom, look no further. The Jaguar 
					XF combines cutting-edge technology with a classic British 
					feel. Driving it is a real pleasure, whether you’re on the 
					school run or cruising to the south of France. The stereo 
					system is easy to use, while the seats are so comfortable 
					you won’t want to get out.” This is the second major award 
					the XF has received this week, having earlier been named the 
					Auto Express ‘Car of the Year’ 2008. This latest accolade 
					brings the XF’s tally of awards to 17 since its global debut 
					in Frankfurt last year. Other awards include the prestigious 
					‘Car of the Year’ title from evecars.com’s sister 
					publication What Car?<br>

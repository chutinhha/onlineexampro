					impressive numbers for the first nine months of 2008. The 
					company’s focus on delivering consistent and sustainable 
					growth through its existing operations has resulted in a 
					strong performance for the nine months under review. In 
					comparison with the same period last year, net profit 
					without capital gain has increased by 57 per cent. Operating 
					margins at 15.6 per cent are up on last year’s margins of 
					14.3 per cent in spite of severe inflationary pressure on 
					costs, in particular affecting employment and living costs 
					across all businesses and food consumable costs in the 
					contract services business. The better margins, growth in 
					operations and capital gains resulted in higher earnings per 
					share (EPS) which is up by 91.5 per cent compared to the 
					same period last year. The net profit of RO22.4mn includes a 
					capital gain of RO4.8mn arising from the divestment of the 
					group’s technology businesses as announced in the first 
					quarter (Q1). EBITDA of RO46.5mn also includes RO6mn from 
					this divestment. Samir J Fancy, Chairman, Renaissance 
					Services commenting on the nine-month results of 2008 says, 
					“The fundamentals of the Renaissance business model remain 
					sure and sound. We are alert to the challenges of an 
					unstable global economy ahead likely to feature high 
					interest rates, lower oil prices and a stronger US dollar. 
					We are calmly confident that we have the liquidity and

                    of November to register to participate in the Middle East 
                    version of its global Best Employers study. Through this research,

                    Middle East Consulting Business Leader, Hewitt Associates, 
                    said that if they receive 100 entries it is a good number 
                    considering the eligibility criterion that a company has to 
                    meet in order to participate in the study. Mishra also pointed 
                    out to the fact that many companies would be unable to participate 
                    in the study for the simple reason that their policies would 
                    not be exactly employee-friendly.<br>
                    <br>
                    “But for those companies who are participating in the study 
                    The Best Employers study provides a credible benchmark to 
                    create a competitive advantage because they would become the 
                    most sought-after companies in the future,” said Mishra. He 
                    also said that data will be collected using three tools developed 
                    by Hewitt which include the Employee Opinion Survey; the People 
                    Practices Inventory; and the CEO Questionnaire. Any company, 
                    whether government or private is allowed to participate in 
                    this study by registering online.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mishra adds and says that for the participating organisations, 
                    the study is not about winning or losing but it is about how 
                    good you are as an employer. It will be one of the best brand

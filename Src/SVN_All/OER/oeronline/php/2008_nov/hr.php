			<b>There are various tools and methods in successful implementation 
			of an effective performance management system and it is imperative 
			to redefine the entire purpose clearly and effectively<br>
			</b><br>
			Ask any organisation on the existence of a performance management 
			system within their organisation and chances are that the answer 
			would be a resounding “yes” and that may well be the truth. However, 
			a deeper look into the organisation will reveal the true chinks in 
			the armour in that while the system exists, its efficacy and the 
			adherence to its principles is found lacking. Top executives often 
			wonder why the organisation is bleeding (man and money) even though 
			the best performance management systems are in place; the best 
			incentive schemes have been implemented and the organisation holds 
			its annual get-together at the plushest hotels in the city.<br>
			<br>
			To focus on the need for Performance Management Systems in 
			organisations and what steps corporates in the country are taking 
			towards building their human capital, the Performance Factory (PerFact), 
			a leading Performance Management and HR Training and Consulting 
			organisation, is all set to host an exclusive event The CEO Conclave 
			in December 2008 that brings together top CEOs of corporates in 
			Oman. PerFact, with its headquarters in India and a presence in 
			Oman, has partnered with Infoline Oman’s leading BPO and call centre 
			service provider.<br>
			<br>
			The most probable reason for the inadequacy in a system or a revamp 
			in the system is because it begins in the middle. A lot of effort 
			and time is spent in modifying existing forms or choosing a 
			different method to managing performance or even choosing to 
			implement a system that was found successful in some other 
			organisation. However the quintessential question to be asked before 
			embarking on such a journey is “What do we want this system to 
			achieve?” followed by “How is this system going to contribute to the 
			well-being of the company, management and the staff?”<br>
			<br>
			It is imperative that organisations go back to the drawing board and 
			begin from the beginning where senior executives are willing to 
			redefine the entire purpose clearly and effectively. And to do that 
			there are some very serious questions that need answers. <br>
			<br>
			There are various tools and methods in successful implementation of 
			an effective performance management system. These include 
			performance appraisals (annual or bi-annual), employee ratings, 360 
			degree feedback amongst others. The balanced scorecard is an 
			effective performance management system and is widely used in 
			organisations globally and was propounded by Robert Kaplan and David 
			Norton. <br>
			<br>
			According to the Balanced Scorecard to establish a performance 
			management system an organisation must answer four key questions or 
			have four perspectives that drive the overall strategy.</font></p>

			<font face="Verdana" size="1">Once answers to these questions are clear, it forms the purpose or 
			the strategy that underlines the measurement of the performance of 
			various departments and in turn the employees of the organisation.
			<br><br><b>Steps in Performance Management System<br></b>1. <b>Determination of Organisation goals and vision</b>: Understanding 
			the organisation goal and vision, what it sets out to achieve, based 
			on the four perspectives is the first step. This effort must include 
			members of the management, the departmental heads and the employees 
			to ensure there is absolute clarity in what the organisation sets 
			out to achieve. Lack of clarity here could lead to different 
			employees working for different goals. For example, an insurance 
			company may focus on improving their gross underwritten premium and 
			therefore the profits or could focus on ensuring that they will 
			provide the best service in the industry. To achieve either, the 
			strategy will have to be specific and employees need to understand 
			those specifics.<br><br>2. <b>Creation of Job Descriptions</b>: The next step is to create clear 
			and specific job descriptions so that the elements being measured 
			are realistic and clear to the employee. In organisations where job 
			descriptions are available it is best to ensure that they are 
			updated and that any additional responsibilities that the role has 
			evolved into are captured. Care must be taken to ensure that job 
			descriptions encourage employees to work beyond their roles.<br><br>3. 
			<b>Competency Mapping</b>: Once the job descriptions are complete and 
			updated, competencies required to fulfil the role must be mapped. 
			This has dual effects. For starters, it helps the HR department in 
			assessing the credentials of new recruits. It also helps in 
			competency deficiency assessment of existing employees which in turn 
			leads to the creation of an objective and structured training 
			calendar.<br><br>4. <b>Determination of Key Performance Indicators for internal 
			departments</b>: Based on the organisational goals, the Key Performance 
			Indicators or KPIs for the various departments are created. This 
			step requires all departmental heads to sit together and bring in 
			synergy to the goals set out. Example, the IT department must 
			compliment the Customer Service department in ensuring that systems 
			and technology backs the goal of ensuring faster turn around time 
			for the delivery of a service to the customer.<br><br>5. <b>Determination of the Key Result Areas for employees in the 
			department</b>: Now that the KPIs for the department are clear, the 
			ground has been set for the Key Result Areas or KRAs for employees 
			in the department. The KRAs must measure and monitor the performance 
			of an employee on the tasks delegated to him/her and must also have 
			an element of futuristic planning so that the employee is encouraged 
			to take on tasks that can further his/her career in the organisation. 
			A sales executive while ensuring to meet the business targets 
			assigned to him/her must also be encouraged to present MIS reports 
			on market conditions and sales techniques to overcome the 
			challenges.<br><br>6. <b>121’s and Personal Development Plans</b>: Measuring and monitoring 
			performance of an individual on his/her KRA enables the supervisor 
			to have a clear one to one (121) meeting with the employee and 
			feedback on his/her performance. This then leads to the Personal 
			development Plan or PDP’s that tracks the areas of success and areas 
			of improvement and with a quick reference to the competency guide 
			the employee is nominated for training programs that helps in 
			building skills and thus increase the productivity of the department 
			and the organisation. This effort can also be effective as a Talent 
			Management system where the organisation is able to identify and 
			groom the leaders of tomorrow.<br><br><b>Consequences of a Performance Management System<br>
			</b>The consequences of implementing the Performance Management 
			System must be made clear to all in the organisation and managers 
			must ensure that processes mentioned and adopted are adhered to.<br>
			<br>While the HR department is the business owner of the Performance 
			Management System, it is imperative that all department managers and 
			the top management adhere to timelines and processes set out in the 
			system. Most Performance Management Systems fail over a period of 
			time primarily due to lack of adherence by managers leading to low 
			motivation among employees.<br><br>
			<img border="0" src="hr.jpg" width="150" height="228" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>What to watch out for<br>
			</b>1. <b>Performance Management System is punishing</b>: Most employees 
			may feel that the introduction to a system is punishing and is 
			introduced to monitor their work. This is far from the truth. 
			Instead a good system ensures employees are encouraged to over 
			achieve, to learn new skills and create career pathways for their 
			growth all the while ensuring the organisation grows.<br><br>2. <b>Performance Management System only has monetary impact</b>: While 
			many organisations use the system to determine annual pay increments 
			and bonuses, the system is also a tool for a comprehensive Talent 
			Management System that determines the future leaders of the 
			organisation. This helps in that every time senior staffs leaves, 
			the organisation does not have to hire from the outside and can look 
			for internal talent.<br><br>3. <b>We were doing things well, so where’s the issue</b>? This is a 
			perennial problem and one that must be addressed right up front when 
			taking on a project of this sort. Introduction of a robust 
			Performance Management System does not only objectively measure 
			employee performance and growth, but also provides valuable data for 
			the organisation to re-look at its processes and maybe, modify them 
			to suit the employee and the customer further. </font></p>

				<img border="0" src="browse.jpg" width="175" height="288" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">In the foreword of this book Tom Peters says, “If you take time 
				to read only one business book this year, I strongly encourage 
				you to read NUTS!” We wholeheartedly agree! Between the covers 
				of this entertaining book Kevin and Jackie Freiberg have 
				captured the essence of the “Southwest Spirit” that has made 
				Southwest Airlines one of the top companies in America. Although 
				Southwest served over 90 million bags of peanuts in 1999, there 
				is nothing “nuts” about the way they run their company. 
				Southwest topped the list of Fortune magazine’s Best Companies 
				to Work For in 1998, and since then has been in one of the top 
				four slots every year.<br>
				<br>
				This book is a must read for anyone who wants to see how the 
				concepts of servant leadership are actually put into practice in 
				a real company of over 30,000 employees. You will learn about a 
				company that practices the golden rule as corporate policy – and 
				has paid quarterly dividends for 97 consecutive quarters doing 
				it! The “Southwest culture” described at length in the book 
				gives this company its strategic advantage. Southwest Airlines 
				has turned a profit every year since 1973, yet it maintains the 
				lowest fares in a highly competitive industry. It is one of the 
				most admired airlines in the world, regularly ranks best in 
				customer service, and has a consistently high safety record. 
				Southwest was the first airline to establish a home page on the 
				Internet and was named by BusinessWeek as a “Web Smart 50” 
				company.<br>
				<br>
				Business trainers and principals of their own consulting 
				company, the Freibergs draw from personal interviews, surveys, 
				and extensive research in telling the story of Southwest 
				Airlines. The authors discuss Southwest’s philosophy under the 
				leadership of its dynamic and charismatic CEO, Herb Kelleher, 
				who attributes the company’s success to its outstanding customer 
				service; low fares and maintenance (no meals are served, only 
				nuts); short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point service; and a 
				belief that employees come first.<br>
				<br>
				Southwest’s primary operating philosophy is low fares and lots 
				of flights. To make this formula work, Southwest management has 
				created a culture where employees are treated as the company’s 
				number one asset. The Freibergs list a number of things the 
				airline management does to benefit its employees, including such 
				programmes as profit-sharing and empowering employees to make 
				decisions. Southwest also mixes in new age management 
				techniques, such as celebrating different milestones, and 
				letting love play a part in running the airline (the company’s 
				stock ticker symbol is LUV). We could not agree with Peters more.

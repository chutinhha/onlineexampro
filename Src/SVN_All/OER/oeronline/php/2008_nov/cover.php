			<b>The worst financial crisis in the world since the Great 
			Depression is having a visible impact on the countries in the GCC 
			region. Mayank Singh and Akshay Bhatnagar report<br>
			</b><br>
			In September 2008, 11 months after the financial storm struck, the 
			US government made its most dramatic interventions in financial 
			markets since the 1930s. In two tumultuous weeks the Federal Reserve 
			and Treasury between them nationalised the country’s two mortgage 
			giants – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; took over AIG, the world’s 
			largest insurance company; extended government deposit insurance to 
			$3.4trn in money-market funds; temporarily banned short-selling in 
			over 900 mostly financial stocks and most dramatic of all pledged to 
			take up to $700bn of toxic mortgage-related assets on to its books. 
			The landscape of the US finance industry has been radically changed. 
			Lehman brothers has gone bust, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch have 
			been swallowed by commercial banks themselves. In little more than 
			three weeks America’s government, had expanded its gross liabilities 
			by more than $1trn. In late September the turmoil spread and 
			intensified. Money markets seized up across the globe as banks 
			refused to lend each other. Five European banks failed and European 
			Union governments fell over themselves to prop up their banking 
			systems with rescues and guarantees.</font></p>

			<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tracing its roots</b><br>
			The crisis has its roots in the biggest housing and credit bubble in 
			history. House prices in the US are on average down by almost a 
			fifth since their peak in 2007. The credit losses on the mortgages 
			that financed these houses and on the pyramids of complicated debt 
			products built on top of them are still mounting. In its latest 
			calculations the IMF reckons that worldwide losses on debt 
			originated in the US will reach $1.4trn, up by almost half of its 
			previous estimate of $945bn in April 2008.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover6.jpg" width="175" height="234" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="5">Globally banks alone have reported just under $600bn of credit 
			related losses and have raised some $430bn in new capital. It is 
			clear that many more write downs lie ahead. According to IMF 
			estimates, without government action along the lines of the US’ 
			$700bn plan, credit could shrink by 7.3 per cent in America, 6.3 per 
			cent in Britain and 4.5 per cent in the rest of Europe. Much of the 
			rich world is already in recession, partly because of tighter credit 
			and partly because of the surge in oil prices earlier this year. 
			Output is falling in Britain, France, Germany and Japan. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Closer home</b><br>
			The contagion effect seems to have arrived at the shores of the 
			Middle East as well. Though the region may avoid the worst case 
			scenario, it is sure to feel the heat. And the signs are already 
			there. The capital markets across the region have been in free fall. 
			Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul Index is down by over 48 per cent since its 
			high of 2008 (see Box). The MSM index has fallen by over 41 per cent 
			since its high of 12,164 points on 12 June 2008. The total value of 
			erosion on the MSM from June 12 to October 23 has been worth 
			RO3,779.79mn. Says Rajeev Singh, partner, transaction advisory 
			services, Ernst &amp; Young, “The biggest concern at the moment is 
			liquidity. And it is not about liquidity at the retail level, but 
			rather the big ticket financing on infrastructure development.”<br>
			<br>
			UAE’s Central Bank in September announced the setting up of a 
			Dhs50bn (RO5bn) emergency lending fund for the country’s banks to 
			tap into. Central banks in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman have also 
			pledged their support to their respective banks in case of a funding 
			shortfall. Says Singh, “The important thing here is for investors to 
			remain confident about the economy and the government should do all 
			it can to maintain and improve investor confidence. This sentiment 
			is more important than ever.” In the following pages we zero in on 
			the impact of the meltdown on a number of frontline sectors in Oman 
			and see how they are copying with the situation.</font></p>

			<font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robust 
			liquidity situation</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
			<b>The credit squeeze is having an insignificant impact on domestic 
			banks due to their limited exposure to global finance</b><br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover7.jpg" width="221" height="273" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="7">If you look at the certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates of the 
			Central Bank of Oman (CBO), it still stands at one per cent, this 
			indicates that there is no concern about liquidity in Oman,” says H 
			V Sheshadri, senior deputy general manager – risk, Bank Sohar. CD’s 
			are instruments used by the CBO to maintain liquidity levels in 
			banks. The fact that the CBO has not revised CD’s interest rates 
			shows that it does not feel the need to inject more rials into the 
			market. Commercial banks held CBO’s CD’s and government development 
			bonds worth RO770mn at the end of September 2008. Banks can repo 
			(borrow from CBO) this amount from the CBO at any time and add to 
			their liquidity. Macro numbers too underline the health of the 
			industry. At the end of September 2008 the core capital and reserves 
			of the banking system stood at RO1.54bn. Profits stood at RO209.3mn 
			as against RO145.4mn during the corresponding period in 2007.<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover8.jpg" width="226" height="479" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Local accruals</b><br>
			“We have not been impacted because banks in Oman have predominately 
			local cash deposits,” says Sheshadri. Bank Sohar achieved an 
			operating profit of RO3.35mn for the first nine months of 2008 with 
			an operating profit of RO1.79mn for the third quarter ended 30 
			September 2008, a 167 per cent jump over the corresponding period 
			last year. Its customer loans and advances reached RO562.2 mn – a 
			growth of 85 per cent while customer deposits increased to 
			RO496.05mn a growth of 104 per cent during the year. The risk of 
			non-performing assets has been kept at bay largely due to the good 
			quality of lending. For large scale projects like Sohar Aluminium, a 
			number of banks come together and lend as a consortium. The 
			inability of a single bank to fund such dollar denominated loans has 
			proved to be a blessing in disguise as it limits the exposure of 
			each bank.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Regulatory intervention<br>
			</b>The CBO has been taking a pre-emptive stance to mitigate any 
			visible impact of the slowdown. It has reduced the cash reserve 
			ratio (CRR) for banks by allowing CBO’s CD’s and cash portfolio of 
			banks under the eight per cent reserve requirement upto three per 
			cent. This is expected to inject RO270mn into the banking system 
			allowing banks to meet their short term liquidity needs. The lending 
			ratio norms (how much a bank can lend) which was supposed to be 
			tightened from 85 per cent to 82.5 per cent from November 2008 to 
			contain the fast growth of credit in the banking system, has been 
			deferred till restoration of normal conditions in the international 
			markets.<br>
			<br>
			The results speak for itself. Domestic inter-bank interest rates 
			which touched a high of about 2.6 per cent on October 2007, dropped 
			to two per cent in the second week of October, indicating a 
			softening of the liquidity situation. Credit growth in the banking 
			system was a healthy 51.4 per cent higher than last year. The CBO 
			avers that banks may find it difficult to access external funding 
			for sometime due to the severe global credit squeeze and 
			increasingly restricted access to international money markets. Since 
			this is a global problem no single country can do much to improve 
			the international market conditions.</font></p><hr size="1">

			Construction</font><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
			What 
			Slowdown?<br>
			</font></b>
			<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>For 
			the construction and engineering industry it is business as usual 
			with a few minor pinpricks</b><br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover9.jpg" width="221" height="282" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">We have won projects worth RO50mn in the last six months, the amount 
			and projects in the market are at an all time high and we have a 
			long list of projects that we are tendering for in the coming 
			months,” says Hans Erlings, CEO, Galfar Engineering and Contracting. 
			The Muscat Highway, a gas plant in Harweel, an ODC contract in 
			northern Oman for Petroleum Development Authority (PDO) are some of 
			the projects being executed by Galfar. The swagger in Erlings claims 
			is proof that the construction and engineering sector has remained 
			largely unscathed by the crisis. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Flip side</b><br>
			There are others who would like to strike a more cautious note – 
			Says John Steele, general manager, Douglas OHI, “If the mortgage 
			situation worsens then the question is will the clients fulfill 
			their contracts. A company has to be cautious whether the client has 
			the money as in such situations payments can get delayed.” Steele 
			points out that one of the projects that the company was expecting 
			to work on has got delayed. The big question being raised in the 
			construction and engineering industry is whether the mega leisure 
			and tourism projects like Yiti, Muriya etc will get delayed due to 
			the crisis. It is common knowledge that a number of integrated 
			tourism complexes saw a number of speculators picking up properties 
			<img border="0" src="cover10.jpg" width="222" height="284" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">to resell them at a premium, but with hardening interest rates, it 
			is going to be difficult for them to get buyers. “I would like to 
			know as to how many of these properties are back in the market,” 
			says Steele. The fall in tourist numbers may also encourage some of 
			these projects to go slow. <br>
			<br>
			Douglas OHI is partly owned by Interserve from the UK, as the 
			situation in Europe worsens it may have an impact on the company’s 
			operations in the Middle East. “If the UK and Ireland go into 
			recession, then it will put more pressure on us (in Qatar, Dubai and 
			Oman) to perform,” says Steele. The industry though has not had any 
			visible impact till now with banks more than willing to fund the 
			capital expenditure of construction companies. Douglas OHI has 
			recently purchased a 70,000 sqmtrs plot of land near Naseem Gardens 
			to set up a plant yard and a permanent labour camp. <br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover11.jpg" width="225" height="179" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Commodity concerns<br>
			</b>The erratic supply of some commodities is a definite concern 
			area for the industry. Erratic supply of cement and plastic pipes 
			are forcing companies to resort to novel measures. To ensure a 
			steady supply of plastic pipes for an off-plot facility in Qarn Alam, 
			Galfar purchased the entire caché of pipes needed for the project in 
			2007 at much higher prices. Says Erlings, “My objective is not to 
			gain money by speculating on material but to deliver projects at a 
			given budget.”<br>
			<br>
			The erosion in commodity prices has come as some relief to the 
			industry. For example the price of steel has fallen from RO620 per 
			tonne in 2007 to RO350 per tonne his year. Copper and Bitumen prices 
			have also followed suit. A strengthening dollar is inadvertently 
			helping construction companies. “The Indian rupee-rial exchange rate 
			is at an eight times high and since Galfar has 19,000 employees from 
			India, for them it is a welcome salary increase,” says Erlings.</font></p>

			<b>The meltdown on the MSM is not just impoverishing investors but 
			is also taking a toll on brokerage companies <br>
			</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="cover12.jpg" width="227" height="299" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">June 12, 2008 is a date that Sankar Kailasam, senior vice president, 
			asset management, Gulf Baader Capital Markets (GBCM) remembers 
			vividly, it was the day when the MSM index touched a high of 12,164 
			points and then started its great fall in which the index has broken 
			one resistance level after another to reach a low of 6587.93 on 8 
			October, 2008. As the global meltdown continues unabated, there 
			seems to be little respite in sight. Says Kailasam, “Even if the 
			market has to catch up with January 2008 levels of 9035 it will have 
			to jump 27 per cent from its present levels.” In financial terms 
			this translates into moving up from the current market 
			capitalisation of RO7 to RO11bn. Generating this additional RO4bn 
			seems like a distant sign post right now.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Liquidity squeeze<br>
			</b>As foreign institutional investors in the US and Europe got hit 
			by the sub prime crisis, they started withdrawing their funds from 
			global markets. Foreign investment on the MSM made up 27 per cent of 
			the total traded volumes in April 2008. Out of this GCC players made 
			up 20-21 per cent and foreign funds constituted six percent. A back 
			of the envelope calculation shows that six per cent of the April 
			2008 market capitalisation of RO10bn comes to RO600mn or the 
			equivalent of three months of trading on the MSM based on an average 
			daily turnover of RO12-15mn. “From June to September whatever was 
			being sold by FII’s was being picked up by GCC players, but from 
			September GCC funds started withdrawing due to problems in their 
			home markets,” says Kailasam. This double whammy proved to be the 
			proverbial last straw on MSM’s back. A liquidity problem in the 
			market has exacerbated the capital markets problem. Market sources 
			have told OER that around August as FII’s starting 
			<img border="0" src="cover13.jpg" width="226" height="443" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">withdrawing funds 
			from Oman, interbank lending from foreign and regional banks stopped 
			and FDI dried up most banks were faced with a glut of dollars.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Facing the brunt<br>
			</b>Broking companies have been the first ones to get hit by the 
			market meltdown. Brokerages earn their income from three sources. 
			One, investment income earned on their own proprietary fund; second, 
			brokerage income earned from carrying out transactions in the market 
			and third, fee based income from managing portfolios of clients. The 
			falling volume on the MSM has affected the fee and brokerage income 
			of firms and has led to an erosion of its assets.<br>
			<br>
			GBCM on its part has tried to weather the storm by being prudent. 
			“As a company we are under-leveraged and well capitalised. But 
			smaller companies which are not well capitalised and more leveraged 
			will be impacted,” says Kailasam. GBCM was aggressive till April 
			2008, but as values started getting impacted it became defensive. 
			“Sensing the mood of the market we cut our positions in high-beta 
			stocks and invested in defensive stocks,” he adds. The company which 
			was growing at 35-40 per cent per annumn in the last few years 
			expects a lower growth in Qtr3, 2008. Though no one is sure as to 
			how long the international financial turmoil will continue, in Oman 
			analysts expect a recovery from Qtr4 or early next year.</font></p>

			being a niche tourism destination, hotels like Shangri-La’s Barr al 
			Jissah Resort and Spa expect to remain largely unscathed by the 
			financial crisis </b><br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover14.jpg" width="221" height="305" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="5">When people do not have discretionary income the first thing that 
			they cut down is leave or leisure activity,” says Arbind K Shrestha, 
			general manager, Shangri-La’s Barr Al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa. Going by 
			the logic there is bound to be some adverse impact on tourist 
			arrivals in the sultanate, but the hospitality industry has so far 
			had little cause for concern. The Shangri-La saw 99 per cent 
			occupancy in October 2008. Its average room rates have also gone up 
			by 35 per cent this year. <br>
			<br>
			So what are the reasons behind this paradox – one, the severity of a 
			financial crisis differs from country-to-country based on the 
			quality of tourists that it attracts. There are mass tourist 
			destinations like Dubai, Phuket or Bali which attract the high, mid 
			and low income travellers and there are niche or boutique 
			destinations like Oman or Abu Dhabi which attract the well-heeled 
			tourist. As incomes erodes the mid and low end customers stop taking 
			a vacation altogether affecting mass tourism, but a boutique 
			destination continues attracting its clients.<br>
			<br>
			Second, Oman has around 1800 room nights compared to upwards of 7000 
			room nights in Dubai. And two-thirds of this capacity is in Muscat. 
			The demand for room nights far exceeds the supply giving the 
			hospitality industry a much needed cushion during a downturn. Third, 
			since in-house guests comprise 90-95 per cent of people dining out 
			at restaurants in a hotel like Shangri-La, the impact on the food 
			and beverage (F&amp;B) segment is next to negligible. Lastly, with a 30 
			per cent growth in tourists from GCC countries in 2008, the 
			hospitality industry is sure that the downturn in the western 
			hemisphere will pass without much of a hiccup. The Shangri-La 
			attracts 40 per cent guests from the UK, 18 per cent from Germany, 
			15 per cent from the rest of Europe and the remaining from the GCC 
			countries. <br>
			<br>
			<b>
			<img border="0" src="cover15.jpg" width="224" height="257" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Survival strategy<br>
			</b>The industry though is keeping a keen eye on the turmoil. Says 
			Shrestha, “Any hotel that cuts costs or compromises on service 
			during a downturn will not survive in the long run.” So contrary to 
			expectations the best way to negotiate a slowdown in the hotel 
			business is by improving the quality of service that one offers.<br>
			<br>
			For example the Shangri-La has introduced a butler service for all 
			its guests staying at the Al Husn Hotel. Thus Innovative service, a 
			better value proposition and rewarding customers is the way to go. 
			“In a business it is essential to understand what adds value (like 
			food) and what does not (expensive flower arrangements). One can cut 
			down on the latter but not on the former,” he adds.<br>
			<br>
			Instead of cutting room rates and discounts the hotel is looking at 
			offering customers value added packages for example it may throw in 
			an additional spa treatment for free or a dinner for two for 
			tourists. Cost cutting goes hand-in-hand. Says Shrestha, “With three 
			properties in operations we can look at improving our services and 
			cutting on wastages like utilities at the same time.”</font></p>

			<br>
			<b>Issues lurking below<br>
			</b>Others take a more balanced view taking into account the

			honky-dory? Doesn’t seem so. There are issues which the industry 
			needs to sort out or is going to face in the coming months. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Credit crunch<br>
			</b>The credit squeeze is expected to make it difficult for 
			developers who are yet to secure funding for their projects. Even if 
			they find investors willing to take the risk, the cost of borrowing 
			will shoot up to put pressure on their margins. To make matters 
			worse, if the government follows Dubai in introducing an escrow 
			account it may make developers scout for alternate sources of 
			funding. Those who have the funding in place may face investors 
			exercising redemption options in large numbers if they don’t achieve 
			their targets in a stipulated period. <br>
			<br>
			Overall, expectations are that the kind of price 
			<img border="0" src="cover18.jpg" width="224" height="219" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">escalation that has 
			been seen in the primary market in the last one-two years will be 
			arrested and that developers will be more prudent in their pricing 
			strategy. <br>
			<br>
			Some of the new big-ticket projects that are still on the drawing 
			board stage will get deferred. In the secondary market, the buyers 
			at a premium will be hard to get, impacting sales. However, the 
			rental market is not expected to be affected due to the steep gap in 
			demand and supply. Some analysts claim that there has been a 15-20 
			per cent of a correction in real estate prices and that more may be 
			in the offing. This is largely the result of a slowdown in off-take 
			of properties in the market as propspective buyers postpone their 
			purchase. </font></p><hr size="1">

			Hitting

			</font></b>
			<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The 
			manufacturing sector in Oman has been hit by eroding export markets 
			and wild fluctuations in commodity prices<br>
			</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="cover19.jpg" width="223" height="266" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The manufacturing sector in Oman is dependent on exports so anything 
			that happens in the international markets has an adverse impact. We 
			are not as decoupled from the rest of the world as a Saudi Arabia,” 
			says S Gopalan, CEO, Reem Batteries and Power Appliances. With over 
			90 per cent of the company’s products being exported, the company is 
			echoing a genuine concern. The company supplies batteries to 
			original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in 45 countries. Around 20 
			per cent of its production of 1.75mn batteries (350,000 batteries) a 
			year goes to the South American and European markets. <br>
			<br>
			The ongoing credit crisis and growing job losses in the US and 
			Europe is having an adverse impact on automobile production. Over 
			159,000 jobs were lost in September 2008 in the US, the highest 
			number of losses in the last five years. Ford Motor Company cut 
			automobile production by 15 per cent during the second quarter of 
			2008 and will follow this with a 15-20 per cent cut in Qtr3, 2008 
			and a 2-8 per cent cut in Qtr4, 2008. This is having a cascading 
			effect on companies like Reem Batteries. Says Gopalan, “Our 
			customers and distributors are not in a position to finance their 
			stocks.” The replacement market for batteries has also been hit due 
			to the increasing popularity of mass transport systems in the face 
			of high gasoline prices (oil prices touched an all time high of $147 
			per barrel in July 2008). <br>
			<br>
			<b>Competition comes knocking<br>
			</b>The loss of markets in the US and Europe has led manufacturers 
			from the Far Eastern countries to train their sights on the Middle 
			East market. Korean and Chinese companies have been giving regional 
			companies a tough time with rock bottom prices. “In Syria which was 
			a big market for us, we have started facing competition from Turkish 
			companies, which play on price points,” says Gopalan. The company’s 
			sales volume has gone down by 20 per cent. <br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover20.jpg" width="228" height="230" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The fluctuation in commodity prices is proving to be another major 
			headache for the company. Lead and polypropylene are the two biggest 
			inputs which go into making batteries. Lead which was trading at 
			$3800 per tonne in October 2007 fell to $3000 per tonne in April 
			2008 and has further slipped to $1560 per tonne in October 2008. The 
			company buys lead based on the average monthly price of the 
			commodity on the London Metal Exchange (LME). If the price of lead 
			falls below the average LME price during a particular month, then 
			customers are not willing to pay for the batteries at higher prices, 
			forcing the company to incur a loss. “Whether it is $1000 or $3000 
			per tonne, the industry likes to have stable prices,” says Gopalan. 
			The behaviour of the commodity market is linked to the fate of other 
			markets like stocks, energy and currencies. If a fund manager feels 
			that he can earn better returns from investing in an alternative 
			financial instrument then he shifts his money. Thus money flows from 
			stocks to currencies to commodities creating volatility. As the 
			financial crisis bites harder the flow of currency has multiplied 
			enormously leading to price fluctuations.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Taking corrective steps<br>
			</b>Reem Batteries has been working on improving efficiencies by 
			implementing a lean management initiative (borrowed from Toyota’s 
			management system). Cost control is being brought in through a 
			better utilisation
			of resources. The silver lining to the situation is that there is no 
			liquidity problem in Oman and well capitalised companies like Reem 
			Batteries have banks that are ready and willing to lend. The company 
			has recently got a term loan from Oman Development Bank (ODB) at 
			three per cent interest rates. The diverse nature of its market from 
			US to Europe to Libya and Nigeria will also help the company to tide 
			over the downturn.</font></p><hr size="1">

			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover21.jpg" width="226" height="298" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The high net worth individuals (HNIs) are in a fix these days world 
			over, more so in Oman. With the financial meltdown in all the 
			markets, their wealth has gone down drastically. Many of them have 
			exposures in western markets apart from the local and regional 
			markets. They have been hammered from all sides. Sankar Kailasam, 
			vice president – asset management, Gulf Baader Capital Markets 
			summarises the plight of HNIs as he says, “Everyone has been 
			affected. Many people in the top-end band have exposure to global 
			markets. When you have multi-market exposure especially in hedge 
			funds, you are bound to get affected in such circumstances.”<br>
			<br>
			<b>Double-whammy <br>
			</b>What about the not so sophisticated HNIs? He replies, “In many 
			cases, they have over leveraged themselves to a very high degree. 
			They have to service interest rates as high as seven per cent 
			whereas the collaterals’ value has gone down drastically. They are 
			forced to sell them or defer the payment.” <br>
			<br>
			Those who have the capacity to withstand the turmoil are holding 
			back their investments and are not going for redemption. They can 
			hold it for a period as long as next two years if required. “My 
			investments in Muscat Securities Market have depreciated by almost 
			30 per cent but I’m not going to sell my stocks. I’m here for long 
			term gains and confident that the market will recover and my shares’ 
			value will go up again. So in a sense it is a notional loss only,” 
			says Mohamed Ali A. Amir Sultan, Director, W.J. Towell &amp; Co. <br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="cover22.jpg" width="225" height="219" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Many of the HNIs are smart and doing bottom fishing with their spare 
			cash. Some are busy repatriating their investments from overseas 
			markets and ploughing it back in the Sultanate or the region. But 
			the buzzword wherever you go is ‘be liquid – though you may not earn 
			on your spare cash but you won’t lose either’. An Arab co-founder of 
			a US-based company with major interests in Oman confided that he 
			sold most of his investments sometime back before the spread of the 
			sub-prime crisis and has not re-invested his liquid money anywhere.<br>
			<br>
			Despite the temptation of acquiring assets that are grossly 
			undervalued due to the market bloodbath to make up for their losses, 
			most of the HNIs are adopting the strategy of ‘security first and 
			gains later on’. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Retail worries </b><br>
			An HNI may have deep pockets to live through the turmoil, but small 
			and medium investors have been hit hard by vanishing investment 
			options. The safety of their savings has been a paramount concern 
			for them. With Inflation in the 11 per cent range and the cost of 
			funds being around five per cent, small investors are caught between 
			the devil and the deep sea. Says Kailasam, “They have to be invested 
			in equities either through a mutual fund or directly.” As valuations 
			of shares have fallen investors can go in for a systematic 
			investment plan (SIP) or investments at regular intervals. The MSM 
			has over the last ten years given an average return of 13.2 per cent 
			every year. But for investors who have burnt their fingers these 
			numbers may be of little comfort.

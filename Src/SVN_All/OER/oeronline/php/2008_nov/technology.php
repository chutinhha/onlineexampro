				<b>Microsoft is charting a novel course in the region with its 
				business initiatives and social endeavours. Mayank Singh reports</b><br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="tech.jpg" width="350" height="347" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">We are a passionate company which believes in doing things in an 
				imaginative way,” says Charbel Fakhoury, general manager, 
				Microsoft Gulf. If passion is the leitmotif of Microsoft, then 
				Fakhoury is its best exponent. Having joined Microsoft 
				Corporation in December 1998 as the business development manager 
				for Eastern Mediterranean countries covering Lebanon, Jordan, 
				Cyprus, Syria and Malta he was promoted in January 2001 as 
				country manager for the region. In March 2002 he opened a 
				representative office in Jordan followed by the opening of an 
				office in Cyprus. In 2001 he was awarded with the MGS (Microsoft 
				Global Summit) Award for his outstanding contribution to 
				Microsoft from Steve Ballmer, CEO, Microsoft Corporation. In 
				June 2002, Eastern Mediterranean region became one of the five 
				Middle East sub-regions based in Lebanon. Fakhoury was promoted 
				as the general manager of the newly established subsidiary in 
				January 2003. His responsibilities included demonstrating how 
				Microsoft could help local economies benefit from the digital 
				evolution process. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Promoting ICT awareness</b><br>
				Having started operations in Oman in 2001 the company has been 
				working towards fostering a digital society in the sultanate. 
				The corporation is partnering the government on a number of 
				initiatives. As a part of a K12 programme, Microsoft trains 
				students from kindergarten to high school. In 2004 Microsoft 
				signed a five year old Partners in Learning agreement with 
				Oman’s government. The five-year agreement encourages school 
				teachers, staff and students to use ICT to improve the learning 
				process and it supports teachers in raising their awareness 
				level. The agreement includes programmes to help provide cost 
				effective software and learning resources for communities 
				throughout Oman. Says Fakhoury, “Microsoft is a strong believer 
				in knowledge transfer as a better skilled younger generation can 
				contribute more to industry and society.” Microsoft’s Partners 
				in Learning initiative, launched globally in September 2003, 
				recognises the educational value of technology in schools. 
				Global in scope and local in implementation, this initiative 
				provides a significant investment of software and more than 
				$253mn in cash grants worldwide.<br>
				<br>
				“We are tackling the issue of promoting ICT in higher education 
				through Imagine Cup, the competition is not a Microsoft agenda 
				but promotes a culture of innovation,” says Abdullah Nasser 
				Lootah, country manager – Oman, Microsoft. Imagine Cup 
				challenges students to imagine a better world enabled by their 
				own talent and also to contribute directly to the future of 
				technology, software and computing. Teams develop innovative 
				technological and digital media projects that offer real-world 
				solutions to real-world problems. Talal al Rahbi, chief of 
				information and awareness division, Information Technology 
				Authority (ITA) is the Omani representative and judge for this 
				years competition. The initiative has attracted 460 applications 
				from Oman this year.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="tech1.jpg" width="194" height="202" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Growth drivers</b><br>
				On the business side Microsoft’s multicore business has been 
				concentrating on four areas. One, innovation and solutions for 
				desktop products. Second, enterprise servers and solutions which 
				includes windows, virtualisation solutions, security etc. Third, 
				online services like Internet clubs, live advertising and 
				searches. Says Fakhoury, “This is an area that has been growing 
				significantly over the last ten years because of the investments 
				going into R&amp;D and we have a big marketshare in this.” Four, the 
				devices business like X-box, media player etc. <br>
				<br>
				Microsoft has been growing at over 20 per cent in Oman 
				year-on-year. The company is confident that it will continue 
				this growth in the coming years due to a number of factors. 
				Firstly, there is a commitment on part of the sultanate’s 
				government to make Oman a digital society. Second, Microsoft is 
				upgrading its capacities to meet the country’s future ambition. 
				For example, in the last one year its staff strength has grown 
				from eight to over 20 (this excludes its staff working at the 
				Innovation Centre). Says Lootah, “Our last quarter results have 
				been better than the corresponding quarter’s result in the last 
				three years. The government is doing a good job though there is 
				still room for improvement.”<br>
				<br>
				While the growth potential of the market cannot be disputed, 
				Oman has its own set of challenges. For example, the level of 
				software piracy in the sultanate according to Business Software 
				Alliance (BSA) stands at 62 per cent, the highest in the region. 
				Comparatively, in the UAE the level of software piracy is 34 per 
				cent. Says Fakhoury, “There is a good commitment on the part of 
				the government to check piracy.”<br>
				<br>
				Microsoft’s vision is to take the power of the Internet services 
				and deliver services across devices. Its Vista operating system 
				for example comes equipped with the highest level of security. 
				Vista is also conditioned to save power consumption – another 
				important idea at Microsoft. “We are constantly working on 
				making Microsoft a greener company,” says Fakhoury. In its 
				effort to reduce carbon footprints it has tied up with Dubai 
				Municipality for the Microsoft Authorised Refurbisher (MAR) 
				Programme. The MAR’s programme works with refurbishers to 
				provide legally-installed Microsoft operating systems on donated 
				computers to eligible recipients. <br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="tech2.jpg" width="190" height="219" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The primary goal of MAR’s programme is to increase the number of 
				donated and low-cost computers available to charitable 
				organisations, academic users and other Microsoft approved 
				recipients. In addition, MAR’s benefits the environment by 
				helping keep serviceable computers out of landfills. In 
				collaboration with Dubai Municipality and Mohammed Bin Rashed Al 
				Maktoum Humanitarian and Charity Foundation, Microsoft has 
				refurbished more than 2500 PCs that have been distributed to 
				different eligible organisations in the Gulf region as well as 
				in different countries like Sudan. <br>
				<br>
				On a personal level too the company encourages employees to 
				contribute to society. Every employee gets three days paid leave 
				to do community work every year. “Our effort is to encourage 
				local talent and add to their skills,” says Lootah. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Financial meltdown</b><br>
				The global financial crisis does not seem to be a major cause of 
				concern for the company right now. The company though is keeping 
				a keen eye on the way events are shaping up. “We have not seen 
				any major crisis or bankruptcies in the region, neither has 
				there been any slowdown in the number of projects taking off,” 
				says Fakhoury. The company is satisfied with the way the 
				software industry has shaped up in the region in the last 
				three-to-five years and is looking at better years ahead. </font></p>

			mobile services, two existing operators and an obliging TRA. There 
			could not be a better recipe to whip up customer appetite for an 
			exciting ‘SIM war’ ahead, writes Visvas Paul D Karra</b><br>
			<br>
			In June this year, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) 
			of Oman granted Class II licenses to five companies to operate as 
			resellers of basic mobile services in the Sultanate. Effectively, 
			these five Class II licensees will be allowed to provide basic 
			mobile services to subscribers at retail rates with their own brand 
			names and SIM cards by buying airtime from either of the two 
			incumbent mobile operators – Oman Mobile or Nawras.</font></p>
			<p align="center" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

			<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="1">Injaz International, Kalam Telecommunications, Majan Telecom, Mazoon 
			Mobile and Arabia Connect (FRiENDi Mobile) are the new Class II 
			licencees who are expected to boost the demand for mobile services 
			as they target new subscriber segments through enhanced marketing 
			strategies.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Encouraging trends</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="tel.jpg" width="200" height="256" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The opening up of the mobile telephony market by the TRA has been 
			hailed as a radical step and seemingly, it is going to be an 
			exciting time for consumers as they are going to be spoilt for 
			choice. After the hype created through a flurry of press statements, 
			conferences and advertisements in the media raising the curiosity of 
			the public, things seems to have petered off to an extent leading 
			everyone to ask the question ‘what next’.<br>
			<br>
			Understandably, customers are wishing that the new mobile services 
			resellers begin their operations immediately. A status check of the 
			Class II license holders reveals that all five of them are promising 
			to revolutionise the mobile telephony sector in the Sultanate of 
			Oman with their products and services. There are other positive 
			things that are expected in their track. More players translates 
			into more employment opportunities for the local population. 
			Secondly, more foreign investments will pour into Oman; host 
			operators will benef from selling airtime and last but not least the 
			consumers will have more alternatives. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Support system</b><br>
			But basically, as resellers of mobile services, all the five 
			companies need the shoulder of either an Oman Mobile or Nawras to 
			launch their products from. In other words, they have to sign a 
			contract with the existing operators. At the moment though, only two 
			of the Class II license operators have categorically stated that 
			they have the necessary agreements in place to begin operations.<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="tel2.jpg" width="200" height="260" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Niklas Nielsen, CEO of Majan Telecom, when asked to comment on how 
			they are going to face the competition from a total of six operators 
			including the existing two Class I operators, confidently retorts 
			back with a questioning look, “I am not too sure all are launching 
			their services immediately. They need the required permissions and 
			infrastructure in place and they need viable business propositions?” 
			Majan Telecom claims to be the only 100 per cent Omani owned company 
			out of the whole lot of basic resellers as it is backed by some of 
			the most prominent and well known players in the Omani market with 
			shareholders including the Al Yousef Group.<br>
			<br>
			Nielsen, who was previously with Nawras, is all praise for the TRA’s 
			bold move to grant so many licenses while saying that Majan Telecom 
			under the brand name ‘Renna’ will offer easy-to-use, efficient and 
			economical services by providing very competitive products through 
			alternative channels and a customer-driven approach.<br>
			<br>
			In the same vein, Antti Arponen, CEO of FRiENDi mobile, says that an 
			agreement with one of the existing Class I operator is imperative to 
			launch any reseller operations in any country, including Oman. “All 
			resellers requires a large number of various agreements, all of 
			which are necessary to provide services to customers and one of 
			those is an agreement with one of the Class I mobile operators. But 
			with FRiENDi mobile, all that a customer needs to know is that 
			he/she will get top class uninterrupted services right from day one. 
			And that is what FRiENDi mobile is going to provide.”<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="tel3.jpg" width="200" height="252" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Jamil Ali Sultan Chairman of Mazoon Mobile particularly thanked the 
			TRA, for awarding the licence to Mazoon Mobile, earlier this year. 
			Mohamed Alhashili, CEO, Mazoon Telecom in his comments says, “Our 
			entry to the market requires an agreement with one of the Class I 
			mobile operators. When this agreement materialises we will be in a 
			position to make a more realistic commitment. As far as competition 
			is concerned, we have to look at it from a customers’ point of view. 
			More competition brings better choice and value to the end user.”<br>
			<br>
			Injaz International Telecom is one of the enhanced mobile service 
			providers in Oman, it is excited about the future prospects of both 
			the Omani consumers and enterprises and welcomes the newly 
			established mobile competitive environment in the Sultanate. “State 
			of the art technologies yielding advanced and innovative services 
			will drive the market in terms of type and quality of service that 
			will benefit the end user providing them with greater choice and a 
			good level of customer service. The people of Oman deserve the best 
			attention and highest quality of service,” says Samir Saade, Injaz 
			CEO.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Slicing and dicing<br>
			</b>
			With the existing Class I operators having consolidated their 
			position in he market, the primary strategy for the resellers is to 
			identify certain segments of the mobile customers which are either 
			not served properly or have been reached by the existing mobile 
			providers. Everyone is slicing and dicing the market to find 
			segments that would be their future target groups. They would then 
			woo them by adding value added services. Over and above this, the 
			first mover advantage will always lie with the reseller company that 
			starts its operations first.<br>
			<br>
			In this regard, all the five companies have been feverishly working 
			to identify their target groups by undertaking surveys among various 
			classes of customers. The surveys apparently also take into account 
			the nationality of people who are staying in Oman, based on which 
			they will provide their services.<br>
			<br>
			Arponen maintains that there is typically a limit how fast a Class I 
			operator can grow. Jumps of 10-15 per cent in customer base growth 
			can easily be achieved by appointing resellers to act as the 
			aggressive customer acquisition company. The success of resellers’ 
			capability to acquire quickly more customers is based on focusing on 
			smaller segments. It’s all about jointly setting common goals 
			between the reseller and the host operator.<br>
			<br>
			Majan Telecom is ready to launch its services this year itself but 
			it does not want to disclose the date. But the company said it has 
			already analysed its position where it will be strong and has 
			identified its customer segments and understood where they can 
			create the value proposition. Nielsen says that since investors have 
			reposed faith in the company, they need to make a viable business 
			case which will succeed. It is important even for the host operator 
			that the buyer of airtime is going to succeed.<br>
			<br>
			Alhashili opines that overall competition is a healthy thing and it 
			brings immense benefits to the customer. But all operators will 
			operate according to their own set of business plans. He believes 
			that Mazoon Mobile would focus on how it is going to differentiate 
			itself from the current options available in the market. On that 
			note, Mazoon is going to focus on the segmented needs of Omani 
			people.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Building blocks<br>
			</b>Although, the resellers do not have the burden of setting up the 
			basic infrastructure like erecting towers for signals, but they 
			still need to have other technical equipments like billing 
			equipment, SIM cards in their own brand names etc.<br>
			<br>
			FRiENDi mobile seems to have got everything going for them at the 
			moment. Arponen stated that all the building blocks like its 
			management and marketing team and all other things are in place and 
			there are some interesting dates in the near future that would be 
			attractive for a launch (though he did not specify a date).<br>
			<br>
			“We have set up our infrastructure and all our equipments have been 
			set up by our international team of mobile experts. We also have a 
			brand new office, with a completely different setup in line with 
			FRiENDi’s work ethics, and we are ready with our products, sales 
			outlets, and even our call centre systems are up and running. While 
			we hope to be on the verge of beginning our exciting journey in 
			Oman, the truly unique advantage of FRiENDi mobile is that we can 
			flexibly exchange equipment and human resources between various 
			FRiENDi countries when needed” says Arponen.<br>
			<br>
			Majan Telecom says its forte is expected to be its extensive 
			distribution network which is being put in place at the moment. The 
			other two differentiating factors for the success of Majan and part 
			of its core strategy are going to be its communication strategy and 
			economical packages.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Cannibalisation<br>
			</b>Whatever their target group is or whatsoever value added 
			services they provide, ultimately all the players including the 
			existing two will have to be on their toes as the final result may 
			boil down to one parameter – service. As telecom operators 
			fundamentally deal with people, a company will only be as good as 
			the service it provides to its customers. Price will, of course, be 
			a major concern for everyone but most of the resellers agree that 
			this will not be a major contributing factor to their success. 
			Nielsen, matter of factly, states that they will not be a 
			‘price-destructor’.<br>
			<br>
			FRiENDi says that it is not just one element it will be changing but 
			it will be creating a totally different concept altogether by 
			building a new brand value by bringing in fundamental changes in the 
			consumer’s behaviour. FRiENDi’s products are attractively priced, 
			but they will not be competing against FRiENDi mobile’s host 
			operator, points out Arponen.<br>
			<br>
			“Our brand name is Mazoon Mobile. The name ‘Mazoon’ which has a deep 
			Arabic meaning is also a reflection of our proud Omani heritage. 
			Mazoon is entering the market with the objective to introduce a 
			positive, long-lasting and cost effective difference to the people 
			of Oman with options that will truly be beneficial in multiple 
			respects. Mazoon Mobile will be the model mobile reseller addressing 
			customer’s lifestyles and delivering value with experience,” Alhashili says.<b><br>
			<br>
			</b>Injaz, an Omani company, will focus on being a responsible 
			corporate citizen that will contribute to the growth of the Omani 
			community by providing direct and indirect work opportunities. The 
			company has an excellent approach to providing tailor-made mobile 
			services to segments of the Omani market. “Customers are our reason 
			for existence and we will do our utmost to provide them with the 
			highest possible standards of service,” the Injaz team said.<br>
			<br>
			One of the highlights of this new scenario is that it will be a 
			win-win situation for the host operator, the basic reseller as well 
			as customers. The host operator, on whom the basic reseller is 
			dependent, can focus on strengthening its their own core target 
			market while gaining additional revenue and traffic; the reseller 
			will have its own niche market; and the customer will have a wide 
			variety of choice. <br>

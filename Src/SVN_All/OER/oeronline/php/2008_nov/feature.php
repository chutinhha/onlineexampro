				<b>A large number of Omani professionals like bankers, advocates 
				and business consultants who could have made it big in foreign 
				countries have instead chosen to come to the land of their 
				fathers. Visvas Paul D Karra finds out why<br>
				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="feature.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">When Wasfi Jamshid Al Said walked into Polyglot Institute some 
				years ago, it would have been construed that he came to enroll 
				for one of the several training courses. But everyone was taken 
				aback when he expressed his desire to join the Arabic language 
				training course. The staff and students had a mixture of 
				amusement and amazement written large on their faces, because 
				Wasfi is not an expatriate but a true blue Omani, complete in a 
				flowing white disdasha and masar. And certainly their eyes would 
				have popped out had they known he is of the royal family.<br>
				Yet, there are many Omanis like Wasfi for whom Arabic would have 
				sounded like greek for a major part of their life because they 
				lived abroad. This new breed of professionally qualified 
				persons, who had a chance to make their name, fame and money in 
				the west, turned around and homed in on their roots and have 
				entrenched themselves firmly here.<br>
				<br>
				One may suspect that Oman is an obvious choice for these people, 
				simply because it is their own country. However there is more to 
				it than meets the eye.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Give more of yourself<br>
				</b>
				Wasfi came to Oman armed with several degrees in financial 
				management and worked with the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF) 
				for almost a decade before becoming the deputy general manager 
				and head of investment banking at National Bank of Oman in June 
				this year. Thirtysix-year-old Wasfi was born and brought up in 
				Portsmouth, England after his parents moved there in 1964. His 
				father was a great believer in education who always 
				<b>
				<img border="0" src="feature1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"></b>felt that 
				anyone can take everything from a man but not his education. Wasfi obtained two degrees in European Business from the 
				European Centre for Corporate Management in Spain and University 
				of Portsmouth.<br>
				<br>
				So what was ticking in Oman that made Wasfi to come here and 
				stay put. One of the things that drove Wasfi to Oman was the 
				passion for the country. “I don’t think I can say that I came 
				here thinking that I could contribute more than the next man or 
				woman but it was that I could give more of myself here than in 
				the UK,” says Wasfi. Ofcourse he misses the UK but at a more 
				primordial and emotional level, this is his place. <br>
				<br>
				Wasfi came here, virtually with a blank column in his CV, not 
				knowing Arabic and not knowing where to begin. But his gut 
				feeling was that this was the place he was going to be in. By 
				the grace of god, he met someone who was indeed searching for a 
				person with sound financial skills and that is how he landed at 
				SGRF. It was an incredible feeling waking up everyday to know 
				that he was contributing something to the wealth of a nation. 
				But it was a great responsibility which he fulfilled it with 
				élan. Wasfi recalls one of Gandhiji’s quotes to reinforce his 
				views, saying: “most of what you do will be insignificant, but 
				you must do it.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Safe grounds</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="feature2.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">His Majesty’s wise policies which have earned the country the 
				reputation of being the most peaceful state in the region is, 
				surprisingly, a key factor which has triggered an exodus to Oman 
				of Omanis. This political setup has seen the integration of many 
				cultures into one single unified patriotic nation irrespective 
				of diverse ethnic cultures, languages etc. The vision of His 
				Majesty The Sultan to ensure that the country marches into 
				modernity while retaining its tradition and culture has 
				permeated every aspect of the society. This has also paved the 
				road on which the economic policies of the country have been 
				built upon.<br>
				<br>
				Almost all the regulatory bodies that govern the nation have 
				been hailed for their far-sighted policies and strict governance 
				that have enabled the country to remain buoyant in the face of 
				the global meltdown. The economic success of Oman despite the 
				financial crisis holds an attractive premise for luring back 
				many Omanis.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Predestinated<br>
				</b>Ghalib Al Busaidi, Director, Investments Department, SGRF is 
				another individual whose dream was to become a banker on Wall 
				Street. However, looking at the present financial mayhem, he 
				declares that he would have lost his job three or four times by 
				now had he been living in the west. “In hindsight, I think that 
				my decision to come to Oman was destined by god because I 
				believe in predestiny and the package in life was acceptable to 
				me. God smiled on me by sending me to Oman,” says Ghalib.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="feature4.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Like Wasfi, Ghalib was born in England in a medical family. His 
				parents moved from Oman to England in the 1960s to work there. 
				Even though his folks wished that he take up the medical 
				profession, Ghalib indulged big time in the London stock market. 
				He says that perhaps he would have been the only 16-year-old who 
				was taken seriously by stock brokers. He dabbled in penny stocks 
				in London and bought his first sports car with the money he made 
				there at the age of 18.<br>
				<br>
				After his schooling, he went to Middlesex University and got his 
				bachelors degree in finance and accounting and went on to get 
				his certification in ACA from the Institute of Chartered 
				Accountants in England and Wales and worked with 
				PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) for articleship for four years 
				working for clients like Lloyds Bank, Chemical Bank, Hill 
				Samuels etc. Those were the days when investment banks were 
				coming into existence. In 1991, he got a call from PWC to go to 
				either Dubai or Oman before going to Wall Street which was 
				Ghalib’s ultimate destination.<br>
				<br>
				Seeing an opportunity to learn the language and the culture of 
				Oman, Ghalib chose the Sultanate naturally on a 2-year contract 
				with PWC. At that time, the world was going through a sticky 
				patch just like the present day but it was a lot less toxic and 
				young investment bankers were losing their jobs. So Ghalib 
				scanned the Omani newspapers and found a vacancy in SGRF and the 
				rest as they say is history. Coming to think of it now, Ghalib 
				says he wouldn’t have traded the Omani opportunity for anything 
				else. “I cannot monetise the quality of life I am leading here 
				now,” he confesses.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="feature5.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Values of life<br>
				</b>For some other people like Sahar Askalan, a lawyer 
				(Solicitor-Advocate); and Sami Ahmed Macki, managing director of 
				Al Mashriq Hotels &amp; Tourism the west been the place where they 
				were able to gain learning experiences and imbibe many values in 
				life like punctuality, empowerment, efficiency etc.<br>
				<br>
				Sahar spent nearly 16 years of her life in the west both for 
				studies and work. In England, she did her undergraduation as 
				well as postgraduation in law from BPP Law School in England, 
				considered as the mecca for lawyers. She then worked for Allen &amp; 
				Overy as well as Clifford Chance in France.<br>
				<br>
				Although, she had an option of staying abroad, Sahar felt that 
				she could contribute to the legal system of Oman. She feels that 
				developing the standards of the Omani laws will help in bringing 
				more foreign investments by removing ambiguities in the existing 
				regulations. “Bringing back the western efficiency of doing 
				business and being fluent in Arabic as well as English, makes a 
				great difference and I feel those are the main advantages that I 
				bring with me,” points out Sahar.<br>
				<br>
				For Macki, it was the deep-rooted cultural compulsion that made 
				him give up his career in the western hemisphere and look for 
				something at home. Born in the US in 1974, he did his initial 
				<img border="0" src="feature3.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">schooling in Oman and later went abroad for higher studies in 
				1992. He obtained his Mechanical Engineering Degree, did a 
				training with BMW in Germany and worked for Oman LNG, Shell, Dow 
				Chemical and Oman Petrochemicals Industries Company. As part of 
				these job profiles, Sami spent nearly eight years working in 
				places like The Hague, Spain and England. “As an Omani, the 
				family pull was very strong on me and I decided to steer my 
				career to be closer to the family. Moreover, having seen how 
				things work outside of Oman, you realise you can bring back a 
				lot of valuable insight. You realise you don’t need to reinvent 
				the wheel. We just need to adapt our experiences to the existing 
				system in order to continue the development of our country,” 
				says Sami.<br>
				<br>
                    Then there are diehard patriots like Omar Adli Al Sharif, 
                    Director, Assurance/ Business Advisory Services, PWC who studied 
                    and worked in London before coming back to Oman. He believes 
                    that there is nothing like the love of his own country. But 
                    having foreign exposure can give you an advantage in order 
                    to succeed in life because the knowledge you gain when you 
                    live or work abroad, be it work-specific or not, can add value 
                    to your job back home, he quickly points out. According to 
                    Omar, “The business environment is good here, the family is 
                    here and most of all this is my country. And when the country 
                    is offering youngsters good opportunities why shouldn’t we 
                    come back.”</font>

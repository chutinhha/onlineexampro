			<b>Rajat Gupta a keynote speaker at the 2008 Leaders in Dubai 
			Business Forums speaks to OER about world economics, global currency 
			and corporate social responsibility </b><br>
			<br>
			Rajat Gupta served as the Managing Director of McKinsey and Company 
			Worldwide from 1994-2003 and is now the Senior Partner Emeritus of 
			Mckinsey &amp; Company. He served as the United Nations 
			Secretary-General’s Special Advisor on UN Reform, is an independent 
			Director of Goldman Sachs, Proctor &amp; Gamble, AMR Corporation and the 
			Qatar Financial Centre, as well as the Chairman of the Board of 
			Genpact and New Silk Private Equity. He is also on the Board of the 
			Rockefeller Foundation.<br>
			<br>
			In his 34-year career in consulting, Gupta served many leading 
			companies on a broad set of topics related to strategy, organisation 
			and operations. He has played a thought leadership role in 
			organisational thinking throughout his career, and led the 
			organisation practice for the firm. during his time at McKinsey. 
			Gupta worked with over 70 per cent of Fortune Magazine’s ‘Most 
			Admired’ list and with over 90 of the worlds top 100 global 
			organisations. Gupta is a keynote speaker at the 2008 Leaders in 
			Dubai Business Forum to be held from November 16-18. He will be 
			speaking on the topic, “Surviving the Rollercoaster of Business – 
			Strategy, Style and Avoiding Disasters Worldwide.”<br>
			<br>
			<b>What are the top three challenges facing the world today (could 
			be political, economic, cultural and social)?<br>
			</b>Today’s greatest economic challenge is the need to strengthen 
			the consensus for globalisation within the world’s most prosperous 
			economies, where many voters now seem tempted to embrace 
			protectionist measures that would impede deeper globalisation. The 
			liberalisation of international markets since the fall of the Berlin 
			Wall has spurred global enterprise and has spread prosperity, thus 
			helping lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. If the 
			world’s wealthiest nations were to adopt protectionist measures amid 
			a backlash against globalisation, they could undermine the economic 
			gains of the last two decades – a period when an unprecedented 
			number of the world’s poorest citizens have risen towards a 
			middle-class standard of living.<br>
			<br>
			Today’s greatest humanitarian challenge is the danger that 
			communicable diseases will continue to spread among vulnerable 
			populations, despite humanity’s knowledge of how to contain those 
			illnesses. By deploying advanced medical knowledge and asserting our 
			organisational skills – often through public-private partnerships – 
			improved treatment has eased the plight of millions who have 
			suffered from such diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. 
			Finding ways to prevent and treat communicable diseases requires 
			cooperative approaches that combine the legitimising authority of 
			government, the human-services delivery capability of the social and 
			philanthropic sectors, and the organisational power of the business 
			community. Today’s greatest social challenge is building a consensus 
			for concerted action to confront climate change.<br>
			<br>
			<b>How will the current state of global inflation shape the world 
			economy? What can be done to alleviate rising food prices?<br>
			</b>The world’s central banks now face the complex task of 
			restraining inflation while encouraging the maximum sustainable rate 
			of economic growth. Even a modest level of inflation, if sustained 
			over time, can depress investment, discourage entrepreneurialism and 
			demoralise both those in the middle class and those who are 
			struggling to join the middle class. At the same time, if vigilant 
			inflation-fighting policies were to become excessive, they might 
			choke off the job creation that society needs. Inflation in food 
			prices – triggered in recent years not just by rising consumer 
			demand for food, but by some wealthy nations’ policies that divert 
			crops toward fuel instead of food - has affected developing nations 
			particularly intensely. Yet because there is no easy solution to 
			rising food prices, governments, food-exporting nations and 
			food-importing nations must cooperate to ensure that supply 
			shortages will not intensify hunger and malnutrition among the 
			world’s poorest.<br>
			<br>
			<b>What are your thoughts on a unified world currency? Is this a 
			viable project? <br>
			</b>The success of the Euro has shown that currency unions can 
			succeed, among nations that adopt widely agreed-upon economic 
			policies and ensure the greatest possible economic transparency. 
			However, it has taken decades for the European Union – one of the 
			world’s most productive economic regions – to move toward a single 
			currency. No other regions seem near the point of adopting a common 
			currency, and the idea of a unified world currency anytime soon 
			seems highly unlikely.<br>
			<br>
			<b>What are the primary reasons behind the soaring prices of 
			commodities? What are the long-term effects of this?<br>
			</b>The intensifying demand for raw materials in fast-developing 
			nations, such as China and India, certainly accounts for a large 
			part of the recent upward pressure on global commodity prices. Even 
			if a momentary global economic downturn temporarily eases the 
			pressure on commodity prices, the longer-term likelihood is for 
			higher prices for oil and food. It is thus all the more important 
			that governments adopt international agreements to move away from 
			oil – along with other carbon-based fuels – and move toward 
			alternative energy sources that help reduce the pressure on oil 
			prices. And it is equally important to improve the productivity and 
			sustainability of agriculture, to try to provide sufficient food for 
			an ever-more-populous and ever-hungrier world.<br>
			<br>
			<b>How much does corporate social responsibility have to do with the 
			future of globalisation and the climate crisis in general? Should 
			reducing the carbon footprint be a global law rather than a 
			commodity that can be bought and sold – allowing some countries to 
			get away with bad environmental practices?<br>
			</b>Corporations have a civic duty to society, in addition to their 
			fiduciary duty to their stockholders: Society rightly expects 
			enterprises to create jobs, provide incomes, design high-quality 
			products and serve civic needs in a responsible way that benefits 
			all their stakeholders. As a constructive and civic-minded force in 
			society, the corporate sector has a responsibility to contribute to 
			the social and political debate over the large-scale issues 
			confronting society – including such macro-level issues as 
			globalisation and climate change in order to ensure that the most 
			creative, sustainable solutions emerge from the public debate.<br>
			<br>
			<b>How can companies grow despite weak economy?<br>
			</b>Managing an enterprise through an economic downturn is one of 
			the most difficult tasks a business leader can face. Yet the science 
			of business management offers many techniques that can help 
			companies not just to survive but to thrive, whatever the momentary 
			macroeconomic environment. Devising a strategy that focuses on the 
			long term, and then executing that strategy in ways that also allows 
			for opportune investments, is one of the keys to sustaining a strong 
			enterprise throughout all the fluctuations of a business cycle.

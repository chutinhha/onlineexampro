                  Not very long ago, Gulf countries that seek diversification 
                  from oil and aspire to integrate with the world economy, have 
                  developed policies that could strengthen their tourism 
                  product. A recently released world tourism report states that 
                  these countries do stand to benefit from a recovering global 
                  economy, provided things remain stable, says OER</font></b></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anybody wishing to 
                    experience the true essence of Arabia might like to know 
                    that - it is just not Dubai anymore, others are opening up 
                    fast. Oman, with all its natural assets, has already set 
                    itself on the high growth path; Bahrain is planning comeback 
                    strategies; and closed Saudi Arabia is getting liberal 
                    towards tourists. All this, clubbed with the GCC union, 
                    means that the member countries are gearing up to carve 
                    their own niche in the market. Almost all of them are 
                    projecting growth in the coming years and have aligned their 
                    strategies in such a way that regional tourism gets as much 
                    leverage as would purely inbound tourism.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>New trends<br>
                    </b>A detailed research report produced by the World Travel 
                    and Tourism Council (WTTC) states that the travel and 
                    tourism industry in the Middle East is expected to 
                    contribute 3.6 per cent (around US$30.3 billion) to its 
                    gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002, and shall increase to 
                    4.2 per cent (US$50 billion) by 2012. Clearly, the report 
                    indicates more than 50 per cent growth for the Middle East 
                    region, and reveals that the demand for travel shall grow by 
                    4.4 per cent p.a. in real terms between 2002-2012. Also, 
                    employment within the tourism industry in the Middle East 
                    shall jump from 2.99 million in 2002 to 4.13 million in 
                    2012, an 8.4 per cent increase. <br>
                    <br>
                    The WTTC&quot;s report, developed on a concept called Tourism 
                    Satellite Account (TSA), is a comprehensive simulation of 
                    the new standards adopted by the United Nations. 
                    Essentially, TSA is based on a demand-side concept of 
                    economic activity, because the industry does not produce or 
                    supply a homogenous product or any service like traditional 
                    industries. Instead, travel and tourism is an industrial 
                    activity defined by the diverse collection of products and 
                    services that are delivered to visitors.<br>
                    <br>
                    The report, in its essence, considers the post 9/11 period 
                    as a defining moment in the history of world tourism and 
                    states that the travel and tourism industry would require a 
                    longer time to recover than expected. This is because, for 
                    most of the last year the demand for tourism was lower and 
                    spending cutbacks were associated with the global economic 
                    downturn. <br>
                    <br>
                    'However, Q4 output has been well above, therefore the 2002 
                    end does not look bleak. In fact, the relative strength of 
                    consumer spending in many countries, with expectations 
                    earlier in the year has helped maintain personal travel and 
                    tourism spending. We now expect the industry output flat in 
                    2002 rather than the declining levels. With output flat, the 
                    industry jobs have fallen this year by an estimated 1.7 per 
                    cent, leaving three million fewer jobs in 2002 than in 
                    2000,Ó says WTTC. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The past<br>
                    </b>In another report, the Madrid-based, World Tourism 
                    Organisation (WTO), had earlier in 2002 stated, 'Tourism 
                    recovery is underway. Fear is progressively fading away and 
                    business is gradually returning to normal although some 
                    destinations might be negatively influenced by the fact that 
                    operators have reduced capacity. Recovery is most visible in 
                    intraregional travel, and in the regions of the Pacific, 
                    Europe and Africa.'<br>
                    <br>
                    WTO had also said that US$463 billion international tourism 
                    receipts were recorded worldwide in 2001 (down by 2.6 per 
                    cent over 2000). Tourists shifted their travel habits during 
                    this period of time, they chose closer and less expensive 
                    destinations. Half of the receipts were collected by Europe, 
                    and almost a third by the Americas (17.7 per cent), followed 
                    by East Asia and the Pacific (17.7 per cent), Africa (2.5 
                    per cent), Middle East (2.49 per cent) and the last in the 
                    list, South Asia taking one per cent.<br>
                    <br>
                    The aforesaid figures indicate how much work still needs to 
                    be done by the Middle East countries in order to clinch a 
                    big pie.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Forecast for Oman<br>
                    </b>According to the WTTC report, travel and tourism is 
                    expected to generate RO792.9 million (US$ 2,062.1 Million) 
                    of economic activity (total Demand) in 2002, growing 
                    (nominal terms) to RO1,616.4 million (US$4,203.8 million) by 
                    2012. The demand is expected to grow by 6.3 per cent p.a., 
                    in real terms between 2002 and 2012. The industry is 
                    expected to contribute 1.3 per cent to the GDP in 2002, 
                    (RO94.5 million or USS$245.8 million), rising in nominal 
                    terms to RO151.5 million or US$394.1 million (1.3 per cent 
                    of total) by 2012. <br>
                    <br>
                    The industry's economic contribution (per cent of total) 
                    should rise from 6.7 per cent (RO490.2 million or US$1,274.9 
                    million) to 7.1 per cent (RO825.1 million or US$2,145.9 
                    million) in the same period. In 2002, the travel and tourism 
                    economic employment is estimated at 44,173 jobs or 7.3 per 
                    cent of total employment, which is one in every 13.7 jobs. 
                    By 2012, this should total 55,219 jobs, 7.7 per cent of 
                    total employment or one in every 13 jobs. <br>
                    <br>
                    The 10,910 industry jobs account for 1.8 per cent of total 
                    employment in 2002 and are forecast at 12,991 jobs or 1.8 
                    per cent of the total by 2012. Travel and tourism is 
                    expected to generate 11.7 per cent of total exports (RO398.2 
                    million or US$1,035.7 million) in 2002, growing (nominal 
                    terms) to RO905.7 million or US$2,355.6 million (11.9 per 
                    cent of total) in 2012. Capital investment is estimated at 
                    RO133.5 million, US$ 347.1 million or 6.7 per cent of total 
                    investment in year 2002. By 2012, this should reach RO216 
                    million, US$561.7 million or 6.8 per cent of the total.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The future<br>
                    </b>The recovery of travel and tourism demand in 2003 is 
                    likely to be substantially slower than that projected 
                    earlier, held back by the continuing weakness of the world 
                    economy, with business travel in particular hit hard by the 
                    pressures on companies to cut costs and bolster their 
                    profitability, says the report. We now expect international 
                    visitor spending to recover by a modest 1.6 per cent in 2003 
                    after falling 10 per cent over the previous two years, 
                    leaving international visitor spending in 2003 more than 20 
                    per cent below what might have been expected if it had grown 
                    by a more than five per cent.<br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, the worldwide tourism industry GDP shall grow by 
                    2.3 per cent next year, compared with the earlier forecast 
                    of more than 5.4 per cent. 'With this growth in output, we 
                    expect some global recovery in industry jobs, up 1.7 per 
                    cent over the year. But this still leaves the tourism 
                    industry employment 1.8 million jobs lower than in 2000, and 
                    a loss of 6.4 million jobs in 2003 compared with a normal 
                    growth of two per cent a year. There are risks to the 
                    forecast if a war in the Middle East materialises, as this 
                    would cause an adverse effect on the world economy and on 
                    the travel and tourism industry in particular.</font><font size="2">. </font></p>

                  <b>-
                  Banking on tourism<br>
                  </b>Ahmed Al Harthy almost ran out of luck the same month he 
                  established his tourist company Premier Tours - the company he 
                  set his dreams on.<br>
                  'I started the company on September 1, 2001, and I thought all 
                  the advice I received from everybody was coming back to haunt 
                  me,' says Ahmed. But business picked up later, and the 9/11 
                  events that hit the world travel and tourism business then, 
                  passed away quickly. Al Harthy has not been in business for 
                  long, but he observes that the contest for clinching the small 
                  pie of the tourism business is intense. <br>
                  'Tourism has not taken off in a big way in Oman, unlike Dubai. 
                  Being an independent and perhaps the youngest firm in the 
                  business, we have to carve our share in a different way,' 
                  explains Al Harthy, Managing Director of Premier Tours. <br>
                  <br>
                  <img border="0" src="smal%20lbusiness-2.jpg" align="left" width="130" height="187">Foreign tourists expect to see something unusual, and Al 
                  Harthy makes sure that their demands are being met. 'We 
                  received a request from tourists, who wanted to dine with the 
                  Bedouins out in the desert,' he says with a smile, 'We 
                  arranged it. That's how we manage to seriously compete with 
                  big companies.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Ahmed started his career as a Ministry of Defence Safety 
                  Officer in 1982 and then joined Petroleum Development Oman, 
                  which he left in 1998 to work as a freelance tour guide for 
                  various companies. 'The three-year experience as a tour guide 
                  gave me an invaluable inside information. I also learned to 
                  depend on myself and do things differently to satisfy eager 
                  tourists,' he highlights.<br>
                  <br>
                  It was not easy to get a bank loan to start him off, but he 
                  convinced one to advance small credit to him. Just over a year 
                  later now, Premier Tours uses the services of ten freelance 
                  guides who speak English, French, Italian and German. 'Unlike 
                  big businesses, these tour guides are all Omanis. It impresses 
                  our foreign associates to have local guides with multilingual 
                  skills,' says Al Harthy.
                  <img border="0" src="small%20buisness.jpg" align="right" width="93" height="131"><br>
                  <br>
                  He adds that the company has an added advantage of offering 
                  its services at an economical price. Premier Tours knows 
                  exactly where it is heading ten years from now. 'We aim to 
                  become the top tour operator in the country. We cater for the 
                  individual need and know how to organise tours through our 
                  local experience,' he says firmly.<br>

                  Graphical magic</b><br>
                  Aisha Al Kharusi, the daughter of a former senior diplomat, 
                  found her family supportive, both financially and emotionally, 
                  when she was ready to launch her own business. Sital Computer 
                  Grafix has been established from a passion to create artwork 
                  that reflected her own personality. <br>
                  'I feel passionate with my work based on a desire to provide 
                  quality to help my clients achieve their objectives,' she 
                  insists. That desire is translated in her work to create 
                  graphic designs for the media and corporate businesses. 
                  Kharusi, a postgraduate in communication design, learned her 
                  skills from brief spells while working in Germany and London. 
                  She then developed her talents working as a graphic designer 
                  and as an art director for a local publishing company. <br>
                  'I used to be so excited to go to work in the morning. Many 
                  people find that shocking, perhaps because they are not 
                  thoroughly satisfied with their jobs,' she says. <br>
                  <br>
                  <img border="0" src="small%20business.jpg" align="left" width="114" height="157">What are the challenges is she facing as a businesswoman? 
                  'Competition from big businesses does not affect me. I find 
                  the market more receptive because I know about the business 
                  and I don't rely on others to do it for me,' she says and 
                  adds, 'I also strongly believe that customer satisfaction 
                  cannot be achieved without being totally devoted.'<br>
                  Running a young business can be both mentally and physically 
                  drenching with professional demands. 'I try to be optimistic 
                  about my work and I have to admit there are times when I just 
                  feel like giving up,' she confesses. But Kharusi draws 
                  inspiration from her dream to see more home-bred talents to 
                  create designs matching international standards. 'We need more 
                  Omani graphic designers for us to excel in this field,' she 
                  says. Where does she see herself ten years from now? 'I don't 
                  really like to say what the future holds for me and my 
                  organisation. It's nice to plan the future but I like to keep 
                  those plans to myself.'<br>

                  <b><font color="#000080">Nasser Al Mugheiry</font> -
                  Accounting for future</b><br>
                  Sitting in his office, Nasser Al Mugheiry is surrounded by 
                  things that matter most in his life. Photographs of his 
                  children are kept behind him and certificates of achievement 
                  adorn the walls.<br>
                  A certified Chartered Accountant, Mugheiry was convinced that 
                  the only way to move forward was to leave his job and venture 
                  on his own. He knew that he would run a successful business 
                  from the experience he acquired while working for Deloitte 
                  Haskins.<br>
                  Although he rose to a post of audit manager, Mugheiry thought 
                  it was time to advance his career in a different direction. 'I 
                  could not see myself going any further while working for 
                  someone else,' he says about his past professional life, 'the 
                  only solution was to start my own company.'<br>
                  He is now the managing director of Abu Timam, an Audit and 
                  Consultancy company, which mainly caters to family-run 
                  companies in addition to banks. He started the company in 1995 
                  against the advice of his relatives and friends fearing that 
                  his company would be snapped like a dry twig in the jaws of 
                  big companies.<br>
                  'They were very discouraging. How would I survive from the 
                  competition of big guns?' The 15-year experience gained from 
                  his former employers is behind his current success as an 
                  entrepreneur. <br>
                  What are the challenges he faced back in the 1990s as an 
                  aspiring businessman? 'To start without external support was 
                  daunting,' Mugheiry reflects, 'but I refused to let it grind 
                  me down.'<br>
                  Mugheiry remembers now that it was so easy to give up and go 
                  back to employment. However, he had to rise above the 
                  challenge and make it successful. 'I had to overcome the 
                  client mentality of big is better. I had to convince them that 
                  smaller firms could be as good, perhaps better,' he said. 
                  Business perseverance, quality service and customer care 
                  finally paid off. He now has a staff of 12, including three 
                  Omanis.<br>
                  'I would love to find an Omani partner to expand the firm and 
                  share some of my busy workloads,' he adds. Where does he see 
                  himself a few years from now? 'The firm would be among the top 
                  in my line of business,' he observes.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>

<b>Half the world’s consumers would give up ‘convenience packaging’ to help the 
environment, but are less inclined to forego packaging that provides hygiene and 
protection<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="market.jpg" width="127" height="216" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Nearly one in two global consumers would give up all forms of packaging provided 
for convenience purposes if it would benefit the environment, including: 
packaging designed for easy stacking/storing at home (49 per cent); packaging 
that can be used for cooking, or doubling as a re-sealable container (48 per 
cent); and packaging designed for easy transport (47 per cent), according to a 
Nielsen Global Food Packaging Survey.<br>
<br>
At the other end of the scale, the Nielsen survey found consumers were least 
willing to give up packaging designed to keep products clean and untouched by 
others (27 per cent); packaging designed to keep products in good condition (30 
per cent); packaging information in the form of food labelling, cooking and 
usage instructions (33 per cent); and packaging that preserved products to make 
them last longer/stay fresher (34 per cent). <br>
<br>
One in ten global consumers was not prepared to give up any aspect of packaging 
for the benefit of the environment. Our survey found consumers’ responses 
towards packaging reflected regional and lifestyle factors which are all 
important considerations for FMCG manufacturers. Generally, Europeans and North 
Americans were in agreement on the kinds of packaging they would forego to help 
the environment. Nearly 60 per cent of Europeans and North Americans would give 
up packaging designed for stacking and storing at home, and 55 per cent also 
said they were willing to give up packs that can be cooked in or kept at home as 
a re-sealable container. Among Asians however, 42 per cent said they would be 
prepared to give up stack-and-store packaging and only 39 per cent would be 
prepared to forego ‘easily transportable’ packaging. Asian homes tend to be 
smaller and have limited storage space, so ‘stack and store’ options are more 
practical and preferable. Asian lifestyles also determine that Asians were least 
likely to give up convenience packaging that can be cooked in or kept at home as 
a re-sealable container, and easy to transport packaging.<br>
<br>
Over 70 per cent of Finish, Irish, Norwegians and NZ consumers said they would 
be prepared to give up ‘stack and store’ packaging, and over 65 per cent of 
Irish, Czech and New Zealanders said they would be prepared to give up 
convenience packaging for the benefit of the environment. Interestingly, the 
environmentally aware New Zealanders topped global rankings as the nation most 
prepared to give up all these packaging aspects for the sake of the environment. 
This may in large part be due to high levels of ‘eco-consciousness’, including 
in-store reminders and recyclable bag merchandising by supermarkets, and weekly 
recyclable rubbish collection instituted by local authorities in most cities.<br>
<br>
<b>Fresh food shoppers</b><br>
Asian consumers place a high priority on fresh food. As much as 90 per cent of 
urban Asian shoppers go to wet markets to buy their main fresh food and shop as 
often as 10 times a month at traditional grocery stores. In Europe, Finnish 
shoppers visit the supermarket/ hypermarket/ discounters on average only six 
times a month, while French, Portuguese, Belgian and Swedish consumers make 
eight shopping trips per month, according to Nielsen ShopperTrends. In contrast, 
Asians’ frequent shopping trips for fresh food means they don’t tend to buy food 
with packaging designed to prolong shelf life or preserve food.<br>
<br>
In Latin America, the world’s most concerned region about climate change 
according to Nielsen’s global Environmental Concern barometer, consumers were 
most willing to give up all other types of packaging if it would benefit the 
environment. These included packaging which preserved products for a longer 
shelf life, packaging with included labelling and cooking information as well as 
packaging which kept products in good condition and packaging for hygiene which 
kept products clean and untouched. Overall, the two aspects of packaging that 
consumers would be reluctant to give up are “protective” packaging - that keeps 
products in good condition, and hygienic aspects of packaging - that keeps 
products clean and untouched by others. Globally, Europeans (23 per cent) and 
North Americans were least prepared to give up packaging for hygiene and 
protective purposes. Thai consumers (27 per cent) topped global rankings as the 
nation least likely to give up any aspect of packaging for the sake of the 
environment, followed by 16 per cent of Japanese. According to findings from 
Nielsen’s packs@work studies in Asia, Japanese consumers claim aesthetics to be 
a strong driver of pack preference. For retailers and the FMCG industry, the 
results of Nielsen’s global packaging survey revealed vast differences between 
regions when it comes to attitudes towards packaging. The factors influencing 
packaging preferences across cultures include whether consumers drive themselves 
to the shops or if they rely on public transport; the size of their homes and 
more specifically, storage space in their kitchen.

<b>Eco-packaging</b><br>
As global concern and awareness for the environment continues to grow, consumers 
around the world are demanding more action from retailers and FMCG manufacturers 
to protect the environment. And while eco-friendly packaging might not be the 
top priority for shoppers today, it’s certainly a growing priority the food 
industry cannot ignore. In fact, according to Nielsen’s twice-yearly global 
Environmental Concerns survey, consumers who said they were ‘very’ concerned 
about packaging waste increased from 31 per cent to 40 per cent between May and 
November 2007. In the latest round of the survey, concern for packaging waste 
was higher than any other environmental concern outpacing concern for climate 
change, water shortage, water and air pollution and use of pesticides. <br>
<br>
According to Nielsen’s 360° proprietary pack research system, packs@work™, food 
retailers and manufacturers are continuously striving to meet consumer demand 
for more eco-friendly packaging solutions that minimise impact on the 
environment. In more eco-aware markets, there is an increasing expectation of 
packaging with minimal environmental impact, although for most consumers, this 
doesn’t necessarily translate into a willingness to pay more. What most 
consumers expect is packaging that provides an added feel eco-good factor, by 
minimising environmental impacts. In more eco-conscious countries, Nielsen 
packs@work studies reveal consumer preference for packaging that is recyclable, 
biodegradable and safe from a disposal perspective, using materials such as 
paper, cardboard and/or glass rather than plastic or polystyrene. Glass 
packaging for example, is considered to be hygienic, inert, recyclable, tamper 
proof, and potentially extends product life. And its aesthetic appeal provides 
positive cues about product authenticity, quality and efficacy.<br>
<br>
We are starting to see some backlash against plastics that are not recyclable, 
or whose chemical composition may lead to tainting or degradation of product 
quality.<br>

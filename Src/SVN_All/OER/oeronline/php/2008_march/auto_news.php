Whether you feel like heading across town or cross-country, the 
ready-for-anything Hyundai Tucson will get you there. Its standard safety 
technology, versatile cargo space and long list of amenities will make your 
journey even more comfortable. In fact, Tucson is so well thought out that it 
was named Highest Ranked Compact Multi-Activity Vehicle in Initial Quality by 
J.D. Power and Associates’ Initial Quality Study. Designed as the ideal 
complement to a diverse lifestyle, the Tucson proves to be an ideal blend of 
form and functionality. For city drivers, the Tucson easily accommodates varied 
space requirements. With a rear seating spacious enough to occupy the attention 
of three teenagers even on long trips and the boot providing ample space for all 
their sporting equipment, space is never a constraint. In addition to city 
driving, the Tucson is well prepared for spontaneous off-road getaways. This SUV 
is reasonably well-powered, with a 4x4 system and sufficient ground clearance 
that allows the driver to handle basic off-road conditions. Spirited driving 
demands stamina, personality and power. Tucson delivers all three, adding real 
satisfaction and excitement. Your choice of engines is exceptional, a superb 2.7 
litre V6 129kW (175ps) petrol engine with automatic transmission. It also comes 
with a 2 litre, 4-cylinder 104kW (142ps) CVVT (Constantly Variable Valve Timing) 
petrol engine with 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.</font><hr width="90%" size="1">

        SEAT’s factory in Martorell has been chosen by the Spanish maker as the 
        location for one of its most ambitious environmental conservation 
        projects, where the installation of solar panels will make it possible 
        to generate clean electrical energy thereby avoiding the emission of 
        more than 11,700 tonnes of CO2. By installing 8.5 MW of solar 
        photovoltaic panels, the system will generate 11.2 GWh of electricity 
        annually by the end of this year. Prior to this, the solar panels will 
        be installed in March on the roof of SEAT’s corporate building in 
        Martorell as well as on the support structure of one of the finished 
        vehicle parking lots. With this new project, SEAT’s commitment as a car 
        manufacturer goes beyond producing cars with lower emission levels, by 
        lowering the impact on the environment during all phases of production, 
        development and subsequent recycling of its products. SEAT S.A., is a

		<img border="0" src="auto_news4.jpg" width="200" height="106" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Chevrolet has officially 
        announced the 2009 Corvette ZR1 – an American supercar that not only 
        establishes new benchmarks for production-based power and performance, 
        but challenges global competitors with a world-beating driving 
        experience that also comes with a world-beating price of entry. “The 
        king has returned,” said Ed Peper, Chevrolet general manager. “The new 
        ZR1 upends the notion of what an American supercar can deliver, with 
        performance that trumps exotics that cost two, three or four times as 
        much – and does so with the driving ease of a daily commuter.”<br>
        <br>
        The 2009 Corvette ZR1 is Chevrolet’s first entry into supercars. It is 
        the fastest and most powerful car ever built by General Motors. It is 
        powered by a new, supercharged 6.2L LS9 V-8 that produces at least 620 
        horsepower and 823 N-m of torque, helping propel the car from 0-100 kph 
        in less than 4 seconds and to a top speed of more than 320 kph. The ZR1 
        is instantly recognisable, thanks to unique exterior appointments 
        developed to enable the car’s performance, including extensive use of 
        lightweight carbon fibre on the hood, fenders and roof. Some of the 
        carbon fibre components, including the front splitter, rocker extensions 
        and roof panel, feature a visible pattern coated with a unique, UV 
        ray-blocking finish.</font></p>

        combination of sporty styling and modern design and generous list of 
        features, sets a new benchmark in its segment in terms of product 
        attributes. A global product sold in Europe, North America and the Asia 
        Pacific, not to forget the Middle East, the Aveo has undergone many 
        miles of extensive testing since its launch in the Middle East in 2006<br>
        <br>
        The Aveo’s most obvious expression is the front section, where the most 
        striking features are the three-dimensional headlamps, which extend 
        deeply into the engine hood and the front fenders, and the grille, which 
        is set in chunky chrome strips. The cross-buckle with the Chevrolet 
        emblem is a real eye-catcher. These optical elements of the Aveo front 
        section impart dynamism to the vehicle, as do the striking V-shaped 
        edges of the engine hood. The hood character lines extend to the 
        powerful-looking front bumper and, in conjunction with the 
        black-bordered circular fog lamps, reinforce the sporty look.<br>
        <br>
        The Aveo’s 1.4-litre DOHC petrol engine delivers 94 hp of peak power at 
        3400 rpm and a healthy 130Nm of torque at 3600 rpm, enabling deliverance 
        of class–leading fuel efficiency with excellent drivability. This 
        advanced engine uses two overhead camshafts and a variable switch intake 
        system that ensures particularly high air throughput at low engine 
        speeds, therefore also ensuring a high torque level. It is mated to 
        either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual. OTE 
        Group is the dealer for Chevrolet in Oman.</font></p>

        design innovation. As a result of its design and performance, and being 
        a modern interpretation of the beautiful cars that made Cadillac famous, 
        the CTS continually appeals to new and younger generations of customers.<br>

        to remind people of what has made Mitsubishi such a successful brand 
        around the world – the combination of the latest engineering, stylish 
        good looks and an unmatchable safety record”. Explaining the creative 
        strap line, he said “‘Switch to Red’ is our way of creating an unique 
        position in the market and it will be at the heart of all our customer

        Palette Miniwagon in Japan</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
        Suzuki Motor Corporation has launched the Palette in Japan. This new 
        wagon-type minicar combines interior spaciousness with superior easiness 
        to step in and out and superior luggage-carrying capability. The Palette 
        is a new kind of miniwagon in which the inherently superior economy and 
        user-friendliness of a Suzuki minivehicle are combined with 
        revolutionary, space-liberating packaging and with innovations that 
        realise huge versatility.<br>
        <br>
        Offering new possibilities for diverse lifestyles, it forms the third 
        pillar of Suzuki’s miniwagon lineup alongside the Wagon R (the model 
        with which Suzuki pioneered the miniwagon category) and the MR Wagon (a 
        model that’s packed with functionality and equipment to meet users’ 
        needs).<br>
        <br>
        A tall body with a long roofline creates ample space for four adults in 
        the Palette. Wraparound glass surfaces give occupants an excellent view. 
        And the cabin offers lounge-like comfort and quality together with the 
        benefits of noise and vibration-suppressing technologies. The overall 
        result is an interior environment that’s roomy, refined and quiet.</font></p>

        Kelly Blue Book has named the 2008 Hyundai Veracruz in its first list of 
        “Best New Family Vehicles.” The expert editors of Kelley Blue Book’s 
        kbb.com selected this year’s 10 Best New Family Vehicles by evaluating 
        each on factors such as safety, interior space, price, resale value, 
        fuel efficiency, capability and, importantly, kid-friendliness. The 
        all-new 7-seater Veracruz has been appreciated by consumers in the 
        premium, mid-size crossover segment. The vehicle also received the 
        National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 5-star frontal 
        and side crash ratings in the SUV segment. Veracruz has the V6 power to 
        take you to really wild places. It is a 4WD, with ESP and traction 
        control, and its sophisticated suspension adds up to real relaxed 
        capability.</font></p>

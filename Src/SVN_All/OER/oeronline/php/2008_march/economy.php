<b>The flurry of measures initiated to check Oman’s inflation is likely to yield 
mixed results<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="economy.jpg" width="131" height="424" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Oman’s inflation hit a 16-year high in December due to domestic demand and 
global supply shocks. The authorities have moved to alleviate the immediate 
pain, but in the longer term, a currency adjustment may be at least a part of 
the key to finding a policy mix better suited to the country’s economic profile.<br>
<br>
In December, Oman’s inflation rate reached 8.29 per cent after accelerating for 
the seventh consecutive month. Food and beverage prices, which make up around a 
third of the basket of goods and services used to calculate the Sultanate’s 
consumer price index, increased to an annual rate of 14.4 per cent, having risen 
to 12.6 per cent in November. Meanwhile, rents, which make up around 15 per cent 
of the basket, grew by more than 11 per cent by the end of December.<br>
<br>
Inflation is caused by a combination of “demand pull” and “supply shock” 
factors, both of which are today present in the Omani economy.<br>
<br>
On the demand side, the high global oil price has caused an inflow of liquidity 
into Oman, as it has to other oil-producing countries. The price increase has 
been steep and has happened relatively suddenly quadrupling over the past six 
years. It has been impossible for the supply side, in terms of goods, services, 
housing and infrastructure, to keep pace.<br>
<br>
Oman also has the additional demand factor of a quickly increasing population, 
due both to organic growth and an influx of expatriates. The country’s fertility 
rate is 5.7 children per woman, which coupled with immigration leads to a 
population growth rate of 3.2 per cent, compared to less than 0.2 per cent in 
the European Union, according to external estimates. The population growth 
increases demand for imported construction materials and foodstuff, not much of 
which the Sultanate produces itself.<br>
<br>
<b>Global factors</b><br>
There have been several strong supply shocks to the Omani economy as well, many 
of them global. Firstly, world food prices increased rapidly last year due to 
climatic factors (drought in some major food producing countries, floods in 
others) and changing consumption trends (increasing demand for meat from 
emerging markets, and therefore a shift from cheaper and more land-efficient 
crops). Secondly, commodity prices as a whole grew quickly last year on the back 
of construction booms in the developing countries, particularly due to China’s 
insatiable demand for inputs such as steel. This has, of course, affected Oman 
as it tries to provide homes (and shops and offices and public buildings) for 
its fast-growing populace and for meeting its infrastructure needs that are a 
prerequisite for its diversification efforts.<br>
<br>
Countries in the Gulf have also come under some wage pressure, partly as a 
result of higher food and fuel costs. Additionally, Oman’s tighter labour 
legislation at the bottom end of the income spectrum and demand for highly 
skilled professionals at the top have driven wages upwards. The most 
controversial source of inflation in Oman and throughout the Gulf, however, is 
the depreciating US dollar. All the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries 
hard-peg their currencies to the greenback, with the exception of Kuwait, which 
switched to a basket of currencies in May last year – but is still thought to 
use the US currency for the bulk of its trade basket.<br>
<br>
<b>Dollar peg</b><br>
<img border="0" src="economy1.jpg" width="300" height="201" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Oman’s inflation rate has been doubly affected by the dollar peg. The dollar’s 
fall against currencies of the countries from which the Sultanate sources most 
of its imports (for which the US accounts less than 6 per cent) has increased 
the cost of these goods to consumers using the rial. The greenback’s 10 per cent 
drop over the past 12 months has impacted Omani importers, who given the 
increase in consumer demand have passed much of the effect directly on to 
purchasers.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the dollar peg effectively obliges the Central Bank of Oman to 
mirror the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate movements. As the US economy has 
been slowing – potentially into recession – and in the wake of the subprime 
lending crash, which has led to large write-downs and a drying up of interbank 
lending, the Fed has understandably been cutting rates aggressively. This may be 
the right policy for the US, but it is absolutely not for Oman, for the reasons 
listed above. The peg, for all its benefits, not only forces the Sultanate to 
surrender the main level of monetary policy that can be used to control 
inflation, but also surrenders it to an authority having the responsibility for 
an economy heading in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
<b>What to do to contain inflation?</b> <br>
The government is understandably reluctant to rein in fiscally. Cutting spending 
could mean compromising the much-needed infrastructure spending to promote 
diversification; the Sultanate would also not wish to compromise its attractive 
taxation climate to choke off demand. The authorities have responded with a 
flurry of other measures, which are likely to lead to mixed results. Public 
sector wages have been increased in an attempt to boost purchasing power, and 
subsidies and price controls have been brought in, while the central bank has 
offered certificates of deposit (CDOs) to soak up liquidity and has increased 
the minimum reserve requirement (MRR) banks must keep in their vaults in 
proportion to the loans they dole out.<br>
<br>
<b>Right steps?</b><br>
The salary increases – which go up to 43 per cent - seem a rather odd way of 
fighting inflation, specially as we have seen that wages are arguably a key 
contributor to inflation. The urge to help the population struggling with high 
rents and food prices is entirely understandable, given the large revenues the 
government is earning from oil exports, which it is keen to distribute to public 
sector workers. However, it is more likely to fuel inflation in the medium term; 
increasing the ability of people to pay for food and accommodation (and 
therefore demand) while a tight supply of both is only a recipe for price 
increases.<br>
<br>
The subsidies announced on flour and set to be introduced on other goods will 
help keep control inflation to an extent, but will distort the market – and when 
they are removed further down the line, there is likely to be an inflationary 
spike. Additionally, increases in food prices often have a disinflationary 
effect on services and higher-end goods, as people divert their spending away 
from these to essentials. However, if subsidies are well targeted at the 
poorest, and clearly temporary, they may indeed be justified until food prices 
level off again.<br>
<br>
Rent caps are another issue. While regulations to prevent unscrupulous landlords 
short-changing their tenants are worthy, capping rent rises unrealistically may 
be counterproductive. If rents are suppressed and not allowed to rise to market 
levels, curtailing the profitability of property ownership and letting, the 
incentive to build new property to be rented out is lessened. This will restrain 
supply, not allowing it to rise to meet demand and alleviate price pressures.<br>
<br>
Finally, the central bank can only do so much to restrain inflation. CDOs will 
soak up only a limited amount of liquidity and the central bank itself has 
stated that a rise in MRRs takes time to feed through into the economy; growth 
is such that the effects, as with the last raise, are not as great as might be 
wished for. Oman, like many other countries, will have to bear out the effects 
of international inflation that has been exacerbated by its own growth. There is 
no miracle cure and the authorities seem to have concluded that short-term 
inflation is a price worth paying for development and currency stability.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the current spate of inflation has highlighted the disadvantages of 
the dollar peg. Oman has wisely indicated that it will not abandon the system 
wholesale; to do would only add little more pressure on the greenback. Oman also 
has no history of monetary independence to steer it. However, in the medium to 
long-term, the sustainability of an arrangement that devolves monetary policy to 
the authority in charge of an oil-importing, slowing economy like that of the 
US, is open to question. A gentle shift to a currency basket can be the start of 
a cautious move to a monetary situation more suited to the strong, mature 
trading economy that Oman seeks to become. <br>

        <b>The Qashqai is Nissan’s newest crossover vehicle, slotted somewhere 
        in between a car and a mini SUV. OER takes it for a spin</b></font></p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="autotalk1.jpg" width="450" height="224"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Nissan’s new Qashqai is a catalyst for change. A totally new vehicle in 
        a totally new sector of the car market. The Qashqai mixes elegance, 
        agility and sheer ability in one very different package. It is the same 
        size as a Ford Focus, yet smaller than a typical compact SUV and 
        promises the driving comfort and fun of the former with the ability and 
        practicality of the latter. Its distinctive styling is a marriage of the 
        sleek shape of a passenger car with the strength of a 4WD to create 
        something fresh and different in the new car market. Named after a 
        desert-dwelling nomadic tribe living near the Zagros Mountains in South 
        Western Iran, Qashqai should be seen as an ‘Urban Nomad’.<br>
        <br>
        Although initial design concepts started in Japan, most of Qashqai’s 
        design and development work has been undertaken in Europe, notably at 
        Nissan Design Europe in London and at Nissan Technical Centre Europe (NTCE) 
        in Cranfield also in the UK. It is built at Sunderland in Nissan’s 
        award-winning plant in the North East of England.<br>
        <br>
        Qashqai’s dynamic exterior is matched by an asymetric interior, 
        providing a focused cockpit environment for the driver and a relaxing 
        space for the occupants. High seating positions provide the sense of 
        security normally found in an SUV, yet is more dynamic with the handling 
        capabilities of a hatchback. It offers a choice of two and four-wheel 
        drive and is powered by a 2.0-litre engine developing 142hp and driven 
        by a CVT with a 6-speed manual mode.<br>
        <br>
        The carefully conceived interior is crammed with intelligent storage 
        solutions for maximum functionality and flexibility. It is also very 
        well built with high quality plastics and soft touch leather. Features 
        are in abundance – the car we drove had cruise control, 6CD changer, 
        Bluetooth and much more.<br>
        <br>
        Nissan’s electronically controlled ALL-MODE 4x4 system – as pioneered in 
        X-TRAIL – is available in 2.0-litre versions. Despite having greater 
        ground clearance than an ordinary hatchback, Qashqai’s 4WD provides 
        greater traction for safer driving and extra control in all weather 
        conditions but keep in mind that it is not designed as a go-anywhere 
        4WD.<br>
        <br>
        Safety is a key strength of the vehicle too. A rigid bodyshell providing 
        maximum passive safety is matched by a plethora of active safety 
        features including the latest generation ESP which includes brake torque 
        control and engine torque control. The braking system is similarly 
        advanced and features Hydraulic Fade Compensation (HFC) to provide good 
        stopping power at all times.<br>
        <br>
        The drive is where things get confusing, meaning, it looks and feels 
        like a small SUV but drives like a car. Its grip and composure through 
        turns is great and it eats up bumps and potholes. Even the steering is 
        well weighted, although it does take a little bit of getting used to. 
        The high seating position provides very good visibility of the road 
        ahead. If there is anything to be concerned about, it is the rear 
        visibility. This is slightly limited due to the Qashqai’s increased 
        height and a small rear screen. Overall Nissan have done a good job of 
        the noise insulation and passenger comfort levels, but there is quite a 
        bit of wind noise at high speeds due to the shape of the exterior 
        mirrors. Other than these minor quips the vehicle, for what it is, is 
        great.<br>
        <br>
        So the final question is: Who will buy Qashqai? Just as this car doesn’t 
        conform to a norm, its customers will tend to be individuals with their 
        own agendas. It is best suited for those who are looking for the 
        practicality of a SUV but not its size. yet have the drivability of a 
        car. Prices start from RO 8,500 for the basic 2WD models.</font></p>

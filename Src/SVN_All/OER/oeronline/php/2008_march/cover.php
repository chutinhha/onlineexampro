SKYROCKETING SALARIES,<br>
Talent Shortage<br>
Companies under pressure</font></b></p>
<p  align="center">
<img border="0" src="cover1.jpg" width="450" height="260"></p>
<p class="Blurb" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Though there have been talks 
of scarce human resources and the challenge of retaining the star performers for 
the last few years in the corporate circles but in the last two years the 
situation has become more challenging for the companies. OER takes stock of 
what’s going on in the mind of employees and what actions employers are taking 
to manage the talent crunch to safeguard their business interests</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">When the UAE government announced a salary hike of 
70 per cent for the federal employees in November last year, the speculations 
were rife that Oman government will also increase salary of its staff. As His 
Majesty declared a salary increase of 5-43 percent in the beginning of the year 
for the government staff, the private sector companies also followed suit. 
Ideally, the employees should have rejoiced with their pay packets swelling. But 
are they really happy?</font></p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">One middle level manager of an Indian nationality 
told OER on condition of anonymity, “I got a so called decent jump of 20 per 
cent on my basic salary which translates to an additional RO120 per month. My 
house rent has gone up by RO 70 simultaneously. The spiraling inflation rate has 
added to my monthly household expenses by another RO50.&nbsp; I’ve to send atleast 30 
per cent more money, compared to last year, to my family in India as the Rupee 
has become harder and the high inflation rate in India has made household 
budgets go up. Practically, my monthly savings have gone down drastically and 
even a raise of 50 per cent on basic would have been insufficient”. The Omanis 
have a similar story to tell as the common nationals are also hit hard by the 
increase in rents and household expenses.<br>
<br>
No wonder whether an Omani national or an 
expatriate professional, everyone seems to be negotiating hard for a significant 
salary increase with their employers or looking for a change in the hope of a 
better remuneration. Oman was already facing shortage of talented workforce and 
with the current boom in the economy, the demand for human resources has 
skyrocketed. In such a scenario, with the possibility of job switch over within 
Oman becoming a reality thanks to labour reforms, there has been a significant 
increase in the movements within corporate Oman.</font></p>
<p align="justify">
<b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Market environment<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Two region wide HR survey reports 
released recently corroborates the trend that people do perceive that their cost 
of living outpaces their earnings. According to ‘Regional Human Resource 
Overview’ January 2008 done by Bayt.com, leading job website, and YouGovSiraj, 
the premier market research consultancy, 17 per cent Gulf residents feel that 
they deserve a raise of 51 per cent or more; 24 per cent believe that they 
deserve a raise of 31-50 per cent and 22 per cent would like to get a raise of 
21-30 per cent. Only 1 per cent felt their raise was at the right level. The 
disparity between salary hike and perceived cost of living was most pronounced 
in Qatar, with a perceived average cost of living spike of 38 per cent, 22 per 
cent higher than salary increases. The widening shortfall has led many to take 
dramatic steps. In Qatar, 50 per cent respondents are considering relocating to 
another country or return home. Oman comes in second, with an equally high 47 
per cent, a major cause of worry for the business owners in the Sultanate. 
Kuwait has the lowest numbers of professionals looking to leave the country. 
People are also looking at switching to another industry. In the case of Oman, 
20 per cent of the respondents are thinking of doing so for better 
opportunities.<br>
<br>
“In terms of perceived cost of living increases 
and what this is doing to retention rates, the numbers are cause for concern,” 
says Rabea Ataya, CEO, Bayt.com. “Around 70 per cent of the survey respondents 
say they’ve held two or more jobs in the last five years. On an average, people 
are changing jobs once every two years. We also found that loyalty improved as 
salaries increased. Employers who do not close the gap between earnings and 
living expenses will have difficulty attracting and retaining people”. On the 
pay linked loyalty, the survey indicated that loyalty improves visibly with 
increase in income. 28 per cent of respondents indicated that their loyalty was 
95-100 per cent linked to pay; 23 per cent indicated that their salary was 70-94 
per cent linked to pay and 19 per cent indicated that their salary was 50-69 per 
cent linked to pay. Only 6 per cent of respondents asserted that their loyalty 
was definitively not linked to pay. This is of particular interest when looking 
for new talent, and identifying potential sources. Asian nationals comprised the 
group with the highest incidence of loyalty linked to pay in the 95-100 per cent 
bracket, and Gulf nationals represented the lowest levels of loyalty linked to 
pay with 8 per cent indicating that loyalty was not linked to pay. If you think 
that the above survey doesn’t reflect the true picture, another recent HR survey 
done by a leading regional business publication that belongs to a large media 
company has thrown up more alarming numbers. It says that almost three-quarters 
of employees in Oman said that they were more likely to quit their job this 
year. Only 14 per cent said that they were more likely to see the year out in 
their present position. According to the survey, in the GCC, workers from India 
and Pakistan were particularly dissatisfied with their current employment, with 
70.6 per cent and 65 per cent respectively saying they were more likely to quit 
their jobs this year. In the case of Oman, the biggest motivating factor for 
change in the job was salary ahead of promotion, training and career 
development. The writing is very clear on the wall more in the case of 
expatriates in Oman. Perhaps gone are the days of long term career progression. 
Delayed gratification is an old concept. The mantra today is ‘I’ll do this, and 
what can you pay me’ is the order of the day – instant productivity and 
immediate rewards. Ask any manager; perhaps his reply will be that he is 
experiencing this almost every day in the office.</font></p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">How big or small the company is, everyone is 
feeling the pinch. Recently while making a presentation to the media, John 
Malcolm, Managing Director, PDO also commented on the HR challenges faced by the 
company as he said: “Skills are also in short supply throughout the region, and 
we face an ongoing battle to retain the senior technical staff to take our 
multiple projects forward. There is little evidence that this situation will 
improve in the coming years.” <br>

<b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Crisis management<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<img border="0" src="cover5.jpg" width="200" height="244" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">When it is not possible to avert the 
crisis, the efforts should be directed towards containment of the crisis to 
minimize its negative impacts. The oil &amp; gas industry, regarded as the best 
paymaster not just in Oman but across the globe also, is facing a similar 
crunch. Oman Society for Petroleum Services (OPAL), that promotes the interests 
of Oman’s oil &amp; gas industry, is conducting a survey on talent management to 
better understand the challenges faced by the oil, gas and related industry in 
Oman. It will be done in collaboration with the Achievement Centre Middle East, 
an affiliate of the Achievement Centre International, Canada<br>
<br>
In a communication to the organisation’s members, 
OPAL’s CEO Shashwar G. Al Balushi stated, “we believe the information obtained 
through this survey will give you a better understanding of the talent 
management challenges and allow you to prepare better future talent management 
strategies and position your company to better attract, develop, deploy and 
retain talent that is critical for your future growth”.&nbsp; The cynics may call it 
a reactive approach as such an initiative should have been undertaken well in 
advance but who could have thought that HR issues will take such gigantic 
proportion in such a short span of time. How many proactive thinkers predicted 
that US dollar will take such a beating in the foreign currency market so soon? 
More OPAL like initiatives across industries could help in easing the situation. 
The companies in Oman need to identify the primary motive of employee mobility. 
As reflected in various reports, the primary driver is higher salary. The 
companies have no option but to give higher salaries even without linking it to 
increased deliveries at times. Most of the business leaders complain that their 
bottomlines are getting affected due to rising wage bills. A closer look at the 
annual results of the leading listed companies in Oman indicates that despite 
higher wage bills, the companies have made record net profits.&nbsp; The big question 
is how to reward the employees especially in the case of better performers. As 
per the Bayt.com survey, when asked about preferred pay structure, the split was 
pretty even between those preferring a 100 per cent fixed versus a part 
fixed/part variable pay structure with 46 per cent of total respondents 
favouring the former and 48 per cent favouring the latter. Performance based 
incentives and the provision of professional training and development courses 
were substantially more popular than stock options, commissions for business and 
revenue generated and holiday allowances or foreign trips as potential 
incentives to be included in compensation package in lieu of pay. 55 per cent 
and 43 per cent respectively expressed favour for performance based incentives 
and the provision of professional training and development courses whereas stock 
options, commissions for business and revenue generated, and holiday allowances 
or foreign trips received 19%, 20% ad 23% responses in favour respectively. Gulf 
nationals were the most prone to favoring professional training and development 
courses with 51 per cent of all Gulf nationals versus 38 per cent of Asian 
nationals citing these as a positive inclusion in their total compensation 
package in lieu of a proportion of salary. On the employee compensation, a 
prominent Omani businessman said, “We believe in adequately rewarding our 
employees. We have introduced a new incentive system in our company. The 
incentives are linked to the performance. Higher deliveries automatically lead 
to higher incentives for our staff. In the last few months we have found that 
productivity has shot up and our employees are earning more money. It is a 
win-win situation for all.”</font></p>

<b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Omanisation policy<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">While talking about the HR challenges, 
some of the head honchos said that though they welcome the Omanisation policy 
but in the current scenario it adds further pressure on their productivity and 
profitability. The Omani businessman said, “I’m in favour of the development of 
Omani human resources. But I think we need to be more innovative in driving the 
Omanisation. We should look beyond percentage terms or numbers”. A prominent 
5-star hotel manager pointed out that on the one hand Oman is promoted as a 
tourist destination but on the other hand we must maintain an Omanisation rate 
of 75 per cent that will go up to 85 per cent by 2010. He added that the supply 
of local talent is not enough to meet the stipulated requirements and the 
talented Omanis opt for more lucrative options.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">Some time back, while talking to OER, MB Holding 
Company’s chairman HE Mohammed Al-Barwani had stated: “Omanisation policy is 
great, it’s extremely important in developing and improving the standard of 
living for citizens in Oman and for developing a strong national economy… the 
government should also make it easy for the companies to fire employees if they 
are not productive. Employees should not be protected in a job if they don’t 
perform. One can still fire an Omani if he is incompetent but it is a tedious 
process to do that. The procedure should be made easier to fire unproductive 
employees. People think that a job is a right. A job is not a right! If you are 
productive, you have a job. If you are not, you should be fired. Companies are 
not charities; they have to compete for their own survival…”</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">
<b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Next generation HR<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">In 
the global market also, the talent war is on. There is a major shortage of 
skilled professionals. According to a Stanton Chase/Birkman survey, by 2010 
there will be 11.5 million more jobs than workers in US. The multinational 
companies besides battling out for the talent, are busy developing new HR 
strategies to meet the challenge.&nbsp; HR has to move to the next-generation, become 
more accountable to the organisation’s business performance, said Pete Sanborn, 
leader in global HR consulting firm Hewitt Associates’ Talent and Organizational 
Consulting practice. He also leads Hewitt’s Next Generation HR research, 
solution development and client rollout. </font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">He informed, “Hewitt conducted a research on the 
future of HR interviewing over 50 academicians and HR chiefs of global 
organisations, people like management expert Peter Capelli from Wharton, Ed 
Lawler from the University of Southern California, Jeff Pfeffer of Stanford 
University and Dave Ulrich from the University of Michigan. We also interviewed 
the HR heads of companies like American Express, IBM, Starbucks and Capital One. 
The conclusion we arrived at was that HR has to be linked to business outcomes. 
It has to move from a vertical-oriented strategy — recruiting, learning and 
compensation &amp; benefits — to end-to-end processes like talent supply, leadership 
and&nbsp; key talent capabilities and high performance that cut across verticals.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">“HR has to be made accountable to deliver business 
solutions. The difference in this approach is the move from process mentality to 
functional mentality. A good example is Cisco Systems which disbanded the 
recruiting function altogether as each business was doing recruitments on its 
own. The company appointed its senior supply chain executive as in charge of the 
talent supply process. The talent supply process, as opposed to the vertical 
functions, includes taking care of various stages from workforce planning to 
candidate sourcing to assessment and selection, onboarding and orientation, and 
first year performance. It’s very important to avoid a linear growth model where 
revenue increase is attained by a similar growth in headcount.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="1">It will be interesting to see 
how many business drivers understands and introduce the next generation of HR 
management in Oman. Sooner they do it, better it is for their companies and the 
market.&nbsp;<br>

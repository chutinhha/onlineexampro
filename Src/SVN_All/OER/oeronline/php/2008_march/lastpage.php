		<b>T S Sethi, General Manager, Oman Modern Electronics Co, believes the 
		key to success lies in creating a positive environment<br>
		</b><br>
		<img border="0" src="lastpage.jpg" width="252" height="231" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Serene and collected, that is T S Sethi, General Manager, Oman Modern 
		Electronics Co. As we meet him, he is busy in the conference room, 
		directing people and organizing things for the day. There are no signs 
		of any strain or pressure that one normally associates with a 
		high-profile job like his. As we talk to him it is clear that Sethi has 
		a mind-set that helps to keep stress at bay. <br>
		<br>
		An electrical engineer by profession, T S Sethi enjoyed working in Telco 
		at the beginning of his career. In 1988, he joined the IT Division of 
		the Al Hashar Group of Companies in Muscat. Here he successfully 
		developed systems for various business functions and was instrumental in 
		ushering in the era of computerised data processing and MIS across all 
		companies of the Al Hashar Group. A firm believer in community 
		development, he became the member of the school management committee at 
		ISM which catapulted him to the position of Vice President at the end of 
		his six-year-tenure. <br>
		<br>
		It is Sethi’s commitment to work that has consistently put him in a 
		position of leadership. When asked how he finds heading a division, he 
		says it is a demanding job as a lot of customer handling goes into it. 
		Giving a patient hearing to aggrieved customer is an important step to 
		arriving at an amicable solution. With an astute understanding of 
		changing times, he feels customers are more knowledgeable today and have 
		to be handled differently. Within office, he tries not to be judgmental. Whenever there is a disagreement between workers, he takes a decision 
		after listening to both the sides. Always converting the liability of a 
		problem situation into an asset, Sethi has placed his division on a path 
		of growth over the past three years. <br>
		<br>
		Sethi says it is not that people are shy of working. But what alienates 
		them from work is the lack of an encouraging and tension-free 
		environment. So he tries to create a positive environment inside his 
		organisation and of course ‘hard cash’ is always an added incentive for 
		good work. Now that the world is moving from labour management to human 
		resource management, a leader’s role is also evolving. But where does 
		one draw the line between exerting power and showing camaraderie? Sethi 
		feels for exerting authority, respect has to be earned from the workers. 
		During his tenure with Al Hashar Goup in Oman, Sethi used to take short 
		trips on weekends to discover Oman. Nizwa, Salalah, Jebel Akhdar – he 
		remembers all with excitement. But over a period of time, the enthusiasm 
		has subsided. Now he focuses on more sedate activities such as 
		meditation, which means staying indoors. He describes Oman as hospitable 
		and which, most importantly, fuels his inherent and constant desire for 
		a peaceful milieu. His children studied here and grew up in a 
		cosmopolitan environment.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		Sethi spends quality time at home and doesn’t bring his worries home 
		from office. Weekends are an opportunity to indulge in a favourite 
		pastime – browsing through the internet and catching up with family 
		matters. Sethi enjoys spending time in his cozy home done up beautifully 
		by his wife. He also likes to do some light bedtime reading. Of course, 
		Arthur Hailey had been a favourite once upon a time. He also has to take 
		time out to browse through business-related technical literature and 
		magazines to keep himself updated about market. Though Sethi has always 
		been ahead on the leadership front, he has always remained grounded. He 
		says leadership is all about honesty, sincerity and implicit divine 
		faith matched by strength of conviction. And what is his quotient for 
		success? “Opportunities had come my way and I demonstrated my abilities 
		to capitalise on them,” promptly came the reply.<br>

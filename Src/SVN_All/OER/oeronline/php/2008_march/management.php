		<b>Linking team diversity to extreme team performance may be better than 
		pushing for homogenous teams<br>
		</b><br>
		During his time working at Vivendi Universal, Fabrice Cavarretta, a 
		Ph.D. candidate in organisational behaviour at INSEAD, says “intuitively 
		it felt that the company would either do extremely well or very badly. 
		But it was not clear whether anyone could have predicted which way it 
		would go. I became fascinated by Vivendi’s top management team’s 
		composition, which was so homogeneous one could feel the situation 
		(would) turn out excessively well, or be a complete fiasco–one extreme 
		or the other”.Drawing on this and other experiences, Cavarretta developed his research 
		on the performance of teams within companies. However, as he explains 
		“the traditional route of studying teams’ performance has been to see 
		how it can be improved with the burning question, ‘do diverse teams 
		improve or reduce performance?’ The findings from research related to 
		that traditional question have been ambiguous. Some research shows that 
		diversity can improve output because it brings different skills to the 
		table. Against this, diversity could reduce performance if team members 
		don’t get along. So when measuring the results on an average, these two 
		effects combine into a flat and unclear outcome.”<br>
		<br>
		<b>Influence approach</b><br>
		Cavarretta says he takes a different approach. “My angle is to make a 
		statement about the range of performance – that diversity in fact 
		influences that range between the highest and lowest outcomes. 
		Conventional thinking explored whether diversity moves that range up or 
		down: I’m trying to figure out whether diversity grows or reduces the 
		breadth of that range”. In practical terms, this matters because the 
		range determines exceptional outcomes – both low and high – which often 
		matter more than average outcomes.<br>
		Cavarretta cites the example of firms searching to make an exceptional 
		public offering, such as Google, a context where exceptional performance 
		is the ultimate goal. Alternatively, from a governance perspective where 
		one is trying to avoid corporate fiascos, such as in the case of Enroll, 
		exceptionally low outcomes matter the most. In both instances, average 
		outcomes do not matter much and predicting the range of outcomes may be 
		more suitable.Cavarretta has three key predictions. Highly diverse teams will be 
		particularly risky, because of what he calls a “social” hazard. “If the 
		team members don’t get along, they will clash, which will lead to low 
		performance,” Cavarretta says. “However, if they do all get along, this 
		can lead to outstanding performance.”<br>
		<br>
		Highly homogeneous teams are also risky since they face another hazard 
		–this time, “informational”. Their performance can be extremely high if 
		they carry out a task in their competence set, where their cohesion will 
		serve them well. Unfortunately, when such teams confront changing or 
		complex conditions, they then dramatically lack the proper information, 
		and perform outstandingly bad”.
		These two ideal cases, highly homogenous and highly diverse teams, are 
		both risky in their own sense, and can be contrasted with mildly diverse 
		teams. Those are not going to be exceptionally good in terms of their 
		cohesion, nor the information available to them. Mildly diverse teams 
		are therefore low risk, rarely outperforming but also avoiding fiascos.
		This linkage between team composition and extreme performance is of 
		importance for businesses, in particular industries such as aviation 
		where reliability is a key concern and where extremely high or low 
		performance is not acceptable, as this could result in an accident. In 
		airlines, “your prime concern is whether you will hit rock bottom! 
		There’s a saying in the aviation business that ‘there are no good 
		pilots, only old pilots.’ Because that context is driven by risk 
		reduction, it’s essential to find the balance in the composition of the 
		team that will minimise risk, which should be a mild level of 
		diversity.”<br>
		<br>
		<b>Outcome approach</b><br>
		The second example he cites is when it’s important for teams to reach an 
		extremely positive outcome. “Venture capitalist companies invest in many 
		firms, and in a portfolio of 10 firms, three die quickly, and two to 
		three are likely to deliver an exceptional exit such as an IPO. In the 
		VC world, the firms in the middle that are only doing average -- even if 
		doing a bit better than others –are called ‘zombies,’ reflecting the 
		fact that slight improvements above average are not interesting, 
		compared to the possibility to make it big”. In that context, knowing 
		that team composition could influence the range of outcomes is 
		important.Cavarretta’s research may explain why an unusual team composition – for 
		instance very homogeneous or extremely diverse – occurs more in nascent 
		firms, because such a team may be more likely to deliver the exceptional 
		performance often sought in entrepreneurial situations.<br>
		<br>
		To support this research, Cavarretta studied the academic performances 
		of 200 MBA student teams. By observing trainee future executives, 
		Cavarretta says his field work supports his predictions that the team’s 
		composition influences the range of performance by regulating the two 
		hazards of organizational life: whether team members get along (social 
		hazard); and whether they have the right information (informational 
		hazard).His prediction, he says, shows “there is no ‘one size fits all’ team 
		composition -- this depends on the context. When risk is to be avoided, 
		mild diversity is the least problematic and helps to keep outcomes under 
		control. In situations where risk is rewarded, both very homogenous or 
		very diverse teams have a greater chance of achieving exceptional 
		outcomes.” <br>

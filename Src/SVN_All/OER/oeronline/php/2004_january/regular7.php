            tech Tell us about your career...</b> <br>
            I have been working with Jawad Sultan Technologies (JST) since 1982. 
            At this time, the telecommunications business unit of JST was 
            formed. Prior to coming to Muscat I worked in project sales with 
            Voltas Ltd (part of the well known Tata Group) and Asian Cables in 
            India. In 1974, I graduated with a B-Tech (Elec) from IIT Powai, 
            Mumbai and in 1980 I achieved a post-graduate diploma in Systems 
            Management from Jamanalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tell us about what you have achieved at JST?</b> <br>
            The first goal when I joined JST was to attain market leadership in 
            the field of telephone systems where we then represented Nitsuko 
            Corp., now known as NEC Infrontia. This we attained within a few 
            years and we have held a market share in excess of 40 per cent since 
            1984. The underlining reason for this success has been the 
            commitment of our staff and the excellent track record of providing 
            quality service, products and solutions. Today we offer complete 
            intelligent building solutions that meet all the telecom, 
            networking, office equipment and security infrastructure needs of 
            large campuses, corporate blocks, offices and even villas. The 
            mission statement of JST reflects this desire to be recognised as 
            'the first choice for technology solutions, to achieve market 
            leadership and excellence in customer satisfaction.' <br>
            <br>
            <b>What difficulties did you face in steering JST towards such 
            successful growth? </b><br>
            In 1982 JST was a relatively new entrant in the market and the major 
            multinationals in the telecom field already had representations in 
            Oman. To compete, we focused on offering customer premise equipment 
            and on very high quality of after sales service. Most customers want 
            the best product with the best features at the lowest price. The 
            challenge is to convince the customer that the quality products and 
            after sales service that JST offers is far more cost effective than 
            low priced alternatives. This approach has helped us to succeed and 
            has also encouraged major players like Lucent Technologies, Lexmark, 
            and Avaya among others to consider us as their partner in Oman. <br>
            Another major challenge is that our diversification into new 
            business units such as office automation and security/ alarm systems 
            business has required the induction of additional resources and 
            product specialists. However, the market in Oman is relatively small 
            and such costs are therefore spread over thinner sales volumes. 
            Moreover, the challenge we have faced in our working environment has 
            been to retain staff and keep them motivated. Customers tend to 
            equate this constancy with reliability of their solution provider. 
            Happily, we have been successful in this aspect with low staff 
            turnover. <br>

            <b>JST was recently awarded the tender for delivering SIM cards to 
            Omantel. What are the details?</b> <br>
            JST has been awarded the contract for the supply of 500,000 pre-paid 
            and 200,000 post-paid SIM cards. These cards are being sourced from 
            ST Incard, Italy. We began delivering these to Omantel in December 
            2003 and will aim to complete delivery this month. The company was 
            also recently awarded the contract to provide the complete voice and 
            data-cabling infrastructure at Knowledge Oasis Muscat.<br>

            <b>How alert are Omani enterprises to overt and hidden breaches in 
            their security?</b> <br>
            <b>e-security:</b> Oman's enterprises are aware of the problems but 
            they have a long way to go in fully securing their networks. Larger 
            corporates have taken or are in the process of taking the necessary 
            steps but not all the SMEs can afford to or are willing to invest in 
            e-security. While the IT managers within organisations understand 
            this threat they are not always able to obtain the necessary funding 
            from their bosses. There is evidence that these attitudes are 
            beginning to change. <br>
            <b>Access Control:</b> Omani businesses and homeowners are becoming 
            more aware of the need for security and burglar alarm systems. They 
            are investing in various systems from simple automatic door opening 
            devices and intruder alarms to sophisticated CCTV systems with video 
            recording and remote monitoring systems. Our company designs secure 
            solutions for banks, jewellery shops and villas. The level of 
            sophistication is determined by our client's threat perception and, 
            of course, their budget.Biometric scanners and access control 
            systems are the next generation of door entry systems. Our clients 
            for such systems include the Ministry of Defence. <br>
            <br>
            <b>How difficult is it to Omanise an infotech sector that could 
            benefit from more foreign expertise? </b><br>
            It is difficult because the local talent available is limited. 
            Unfortunately not every Omani graduate is as good as one would 
            expect on the basis of the curriculum. Those who are good are 
            considering employment with the oil companies, banks or the 
            government. The evaluation system adopted by education institutions 
            needs to be reviewed if the quality of pass students is to match up 
            to international standards. At present the performance of teachers 
            and institutions are evaluated on the basis of a pass percentage 
            which, in my opinion, does not necessarily represent the actual 
            quality or level of education that the student has acquired. This 
            is, I think, one of the reasons for the skills gap we face. 
            Omanisation is certainly a socio-economic need and employment must 
            be found for the growing number of Omani youth leaving schools and 
            colleges. At the same time, it is very important that the student 
            assessment system be improved so that quality is not compromised and 
            employers have no hesitation in employing these students. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Can Oman develop call centres for multinational companies as 
            successfully as India is doing? </b><br>
            The major cost of a call centre is the cost of the agent. Obviously 
            a bigger pool of agents is available in India and at very 
            competitive rates. Besides, English is widely spoken in India and it 
            has had a head start over Oman. At the same time call centres offer 
            a large potential for employment of Omani youth and therefore the 
            focus should be on how to make Oman an attractive destination for 
            this business. In India, the number of call centres has grown 
            exponentially as a result the earnings per seat have also dropped. 
            Today, Indian call centres are looking at offering technical help 
            desks that add value to the simple call centre and are also looking 
            at Sri Lanka as a disaster recovery site. Oman could position itself 
            to take some of this business. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which business gurus do you favour and why? <br>
            </b>I value the teachings of Dr. Edward De Bono and Dr. Stephen 
            Covey. At the same time, I realise that the market we operate in is 
            so small that what is a SME to a business guru who visits the region 
            to conduct a three-day course on an aspect of management is a very 
            large corporate in our market. Therefore one should be careful in 
            applying some of their theories as quite often the philosophies 
            preached by such an expert are not altogether in sync with the size 
            of the business that we manage. Besides this, most of the businesses 
            here are family owned and governed by a different set of rules.</font></p>

                    the most talked about aspect of the property market at the 
                    present time is the proposed introduction of legislation 
                    which would give expatriates the right to buy property in 
                    Oman. The expectation is that this will be introduced in 
                    2004 although it appears that there are concerns over a 
                    number of issues and this may result in restrictions and 
                    conditions being applied. <br>
                    <br>
                    Perhaps based upon the Dubai experience, there is some fear 
                    of a flood of purchasers, particularly with property 
                    ownership being linked to the issue of residence visas. In 
                    the end we may be presented with something similar to 
                    Bahrain where the government has recently offered permanent 
                    residence to expatriates purchasing residential units in 
                    certain new high quality residential developments. <br>
                    <br>
                    The impact upon the property market will to a large extent 
                    be determined by the terms of the legislation introduced but 
                    generally there is likely to be a positive impact created by 
                    the demand for properties and it will open up a range of new 
                    development opportunities. Already one scheme being marketed 
                    is aimed partially at expatriate purchasers and other 
                    competing schemes are on the drawing board and likely to 
                    come to fruition once the change in the law is confirmed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst the idea of purchasing developer built villas is 
                    familiar to expatriates it remains a new concept to local 
                    purchasers who are more familiar with acquiring a plot and 
                    constructing their own property. <br>
                    <br>
                    A number of investors have for some time been considering 
                    the development of schemes aimed specifically at local 
                    purchasers. With limited land availability in the centre of 
                    the capital area and with increased housing requirement from 
                    younger middle class locals the time may well be right for a 
                    new ground braking scheme to be introduced and this may be 
                    something that we will see in introduced in 2004. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the more traditional residential markets, rental demand 
                    remains relatively strong with expatriate numbers appearing 
                    to have stabilised and good quality properties continuing to 
                    maintain relatively high occupancy rates and strong rental 
                    levels. Many tenants now have rental allowances rather than 
                    being provided with accommodation directly from their 
                    company and are becoming more discerning. We can therefore 
                    expect to see a move towards the provision of better quality 
                    accommodation with additional services and perhaps a 
                    corresponding decline in older poorer quality properties.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The retail market has probably seen the greatest change over 
                    the last few years with the introduction of two major 
                    shopping malls (City Centre and Markaz Al Bhaja) together 
                    with the introduction to the market of large-scale retailers 
                    such as Sultan Centre and Lulu Centre. To date more 
                    traditional smaller shopping centres have managed to retain 
                    relatively high occupancy levels although there has 
                    generally been some fall in rental levels. <br>
                    <br>
                    The year 2004 will see the opening of the large Lulu Centre 
                    hypermarket in Ghubrah and a number of smaller schemes which 
                    will further increase the supply, and increase the 
                    competition for other operators. The common perception 
                    appears to be that, with its population and spending power, 
                    Muscat will become oversupplied with retail space and 2004 
                    is likely to be a time when the various centres and 
                    operators fight it out for their respective market share. In 
                    the short term at least customers appear likely to be the 
                    beneficiaries as the operators strive to improve the pricing 
                    and service that they are able to offer. <br>
                    <br>
                    The office market has been relatively flat over the last few 
                    years and we expect limited change in 2004. The amount of 
                    vacant space which resulted from the construction of a 
                    series of new buildings 3/4 years ago is now declining as 
                    more space becomes occupied but still there remains a supply 
                    of available space. <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst this may well lead to new speculative schemes being 
                    commenced it is worth noting that landlords have often had 
                    to lease space at relatively low rentals in order to lease 
                    space and it remains a tenants market. The challenge for 
                    developers is to construct good quality accommodation that 
                    is attractive to tenants but which at the same time also 
                    provides an adequate return on investment based on 
                    prevailing rental rates.</font></p>

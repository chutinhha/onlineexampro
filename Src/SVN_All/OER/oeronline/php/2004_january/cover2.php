                    are closely linked to the Omani people and, apart from being 
                    just a mode of transport, have become an integral part of 
                    our lives and lifestyles. The automobile market has steadily 
                    grown over the past years barring a few exceptions mainly 
                    resulting from oil price slumps. This trend is likely to 
                    continue in the future, particularly with Oman's population 
                    growth, increasing youth population, higher employment 
                    opportunities due to the emphasis on Omanisation and the 
                    rise in demand from the 'ladies' segment. Multiple vehicle 
                    ownership - typically, a sedan, an SUV and an MPV in some 
                    cases - is becoming the norm in the market. <br>
                    <br>
                    The development of the used car market, which today is in a 
                    very nascent stage, too has to be kept in mind. With the 
                    overall improvement in quality, present models tend to 
                    remain road-worthy for a long time. This does not 
                    necessarily mean a longer ownership by a single individual 
                    since people also like to change their vehicles with the 
                    introduction of new models. However, the availability of 
                    quality used cars offers customers an alternative to new 
                    cars. <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of the market constitution too, I expect 
                    substantial metamorphosis in the future. We have already 
                    witnessed the growth in new segments such as hatchback 
                    models, multi-purpose vehicles etc. Even in traditional 
                    segments such as sedans, SUVs and commercial vehicles, we 
                    are seeing increasing sub-segmentation. The future will see 
                    a further proliferation of segments, making it necessary for 
                    manufacturers to offer a wide range of products catering to 
                    various segments. <br>
                    <br>
                    Customers too are getting more informed and, hence, 
                    increasingly discerning and demanding. With the advent of 
                    the IT media, they are exposed to world-wide automobile 
                    trends. Automobile purchase decisions will be even more 
                    involved with customers seeking greater information before 
                    deciding. However, the core values of quality, durability 
                    and reliability will remain although vehicles with trendy 
                    styling, better safety and enhanced value-for-money will 
                    find greater acceptance. <br>
                    <br>
                    Competition in the marketplace will get further intense 
                    despite the fact that the automobile market in Oman is 
                    already one of very high competition even today. This will 
                    not only benefit the customers, but also bring out the best 
                    among the competing brands in the country. <br>
                    <br>
                    The success of automobile brands in the future will depend 
                    on the ability to deliver quality products at affordable 
                    prices. Prices here refer to not only the initial cost of 
                    purchase, but even running, maintenance costs and last but 
                    not the least - resale value. In short, the 'Total cost of 
                    Ownership' and not just the initial price will play a 
                    crucial role. Toyota, for instance, has been able to gain 
                    and maintain a dominant share of around 50 per cent in 
                    Oman's automobiles market despite the relatively higher 
                    initial costs only due to its low running/maintenance costs 
                    as well as high resale values after years of punishing use. 
                    Innovative financial schemes will also be required to meet 
                    the customer's budgetary constraints. <br>
                    <br>
                    Also, distributors, in conjunction with manufacturers, will 
                    have to constantly invent and innovate to offer the right 
                    products catering to the fast changing market trends. We, 
                    for one, have been working very closely with Toyota Motor 
                    Corporation to offer new and improved models tailored to the 
                    Oman market. To illustrate, we have just launched the new 
                    Hatchback xA targeting the youth and the ladies segments. 
                    Many more new models are on the anvil. <br>
                    <br>
                    A good product should be backed by savvy sales and 
                    marketing. Investments in brand building will yield 
                    long-term competitive advantages. Innovative advertising and 
                    communications, which constantly capture customer attention 
                    and generate excitement will make a big difference. We also 
                    need to add 'value' through product-plus offerings such as 
                    extended warranty etc. <br>
                    <br>
                    Customer satisfaction will play a dominant role in not only 
                    increasing volumes and market share, but also creating 
                    long-term customers. It is an established marketing truth 
                    that retaining existing customers is far more feasible and 
                    economical than netting new ones. After-sales service will, 
                    therefore, play a major role in the future of the automobile 
                    industry and more investments will be required to meet 
                    customer expectations. In Toyota, for instance, we have 
                    accorded top priority to customer satisfaction through 
                    durable competitive strengths such as vast infrastructure, 
                    98 per cent parts availability, 24-hours service etc. <br>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, the automobiles market will be the real 
                    testing ground for the best companies in Oman.</font></p>

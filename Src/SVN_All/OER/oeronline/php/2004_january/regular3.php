            <img border="0" src="book2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="180" height="127">The 
            Creative Manager's Pocketbook by John Townsend and Jacque Favier is 
            a very practical and easy-to-read book of 100 odd pages with lots of 
            illustrations. It is billed as a pocketbook of tests and techniques 
            &quot;for managers and professionals for whom creativity means business 
            survival and business growth&quot; but does it live up to this 
            description? The answer is mostly 'yes'. In the highly competitive 
            business environment of Oman, what is the right thinking at this 
            time can be wrong within no time at all. The authors have very 
            fascinatingly defined the vast scope of creativity and how to reach 
            your maximum creative potential. Because at times one doesn't even 
            know how creative one is, there are some excellent tools, exercises 
            and creativity quizzes to assess one's creativity. And I feel one 
            could actually improve one's creativity very quickly by following 
            some very simple and effective tips given by the book's authors. 
            While the pocketbook contains some interesting suggestions and 
            techniques of producing creative ideas (and the do's and don't's of 
            the same), it also provides tips on how one can turn a seemingly 
            negative situation into a positive one. There are techniques
            <img border="0" src="book2a.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="100" height="125">about 
            creating solutions in illogical ways which are fun attempting and 
            which could well be, amazingly, very creatively workable. Most 
            important of all, there are thoughts on selling such ideas to your 
            bosses and to your clients. I particularly like the concluding 
            remark: It's not creative unless it sells. All in all, The Creative 
            Manager's Pocketbook is a must read for all those who want to be at 
            their creative best for those outstanding performances we all would 
            like to produce day after day. -<br>

            The skills and practice of marketing from A to Z <br>
            Price: RO7.500 215pp<br>
            <b>The Economist</b><br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="book1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="120" height="245">From 
            the same pocket series as Pocket Economist, Pocket MBA and Pocket 
            Money for which The Economist is renowned, comes Pocket Marketing. 
            Divided into three sections, the booklet contains essays on the 
            digital era and the renaissance of the brand and advertising, an A-Z 
            of terms and concepts that stretches from 'Affinity marketing' all 
            the way to 'Zap' and appendices that include a wide range of data on 
            brands and advertising with some areas of recommended reading. <br>
            <br>
            Personally, I found this guidebook to be very interesting and very 
            informative about the world of marketing in today's society. I was 
            impressed at the layout of the book as it was split into many 
            different categories all explaining their titles in good detail. I 
            also felt the book could have been a bit more to the point as it was 
            quite long winded in its explanations especially in the first 
            section. The book does, however, advise lots of other books that you 
            could use to research certain subjects further. <br>
            <br>
            What I found fascinating was how Pocket Marketing was in 
            alphabetical order, which I thought could be helpful to other 
            readers in case there was a specific point or topic they needed to 
            research. Most of the booklet was based on the new economy, which is 
            a good thing as some of the books I have read in the past have been 
            somewhat out dated in their viewpoints. Some of the issues raised in 
            this book are to some extent uninformative in 
                  <img border="0" src="book1a.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="125">their execution yet 
            others are very well described and presented. Also, the end section 
            of this book contained lots of interesting statistics, albeit mainly 
            US-based. My overall conclusion is that this pocket guide was good 
            but I think it should have been a bit more informative and more 
            precise in some areas. Nonetheless, it's a pleasing and enjoyable 
            read.</font></p>

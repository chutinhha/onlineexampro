                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">On December 
                    9, 2003, OCIPED hosted a seminar on Economic Freedom 
                    organised by key representatives from The Fraser Institute 
                    and consultancy organisation Strategic Economic and 
                    Environmental Research Studies (SEERS). OCIPED invited 
                    guests from both private and public sector organisations to 
                    attend and to participate in workshops intended to improve 
                    their understanding of where Oman was positioned in relation 
                    to other nations' economic freedom and how the Sultanate 
                    could pave the way to improve its overall ranking. <br>
                    The Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) project is the 
                    culmination of a project dating back 15 years following a 
                    conversation between Michael Walker and Nobel laureate 
                    Milton Friedman. The question they raised was how economic 
                    freedom could be measured in order to objectively correlate 
                    it with supposed benefits. Several symposia and variants of 
                    the index have led to the 2003 EFW index. With a ranking for 
                    123 nations covering 91 per cent of the world's population, 
                    the EFW index is considered the most comprehensive of the 
                    various socio-economic indices produced today.<br>
                    As Nobel Laureate Douglass North has written, the measure of 
                    economic freedom provides the best description yet of 
                    efficient markets and it can become used as a map to guide 
                    economies to becoming more efficient and productive. The EFW 
                    index is made up of 38 parameters, broken down into five 
                    categories and several sub-categories. The five components 
                    lend equal weight to the overall index score. The key 
                    ingredients of economic freedom are personal choice, 
                    voluntary exchange, freedom to compete and protection of 
                    person and property. In particular, the EFW index measures 
                    the degree of economic freedom present in five major areas: 
                    size of government; legal structures and security of 
                    property rights; access to sound money; freedom to exchange 
                    with foreigners; and regulation of credit, labour and 
                    business. </font></p>

            Oman score? </b><br>
            Oman's overall EFW score is 7.4. The result ranks the Sultanate as 
            the world's 18th most economically free country in the world, in 
            joint place with Belgium. This is a tremendous achievement and one 
            that is underlined by the fact that the Sultanate is deemed to be 
            the second most economically free nation in the Middle East. Hong 
            Kong clawed the first position in the index of economic freedom 
            while Singapore and the US were placed in second and third positions 
            respectively with New Zealand and the UK ranked joint fourth.<br>
            <br>
            In one particular area, that of 'access to sound money', Oman scores 
            9.7 which ranks it as the sixth most economically free nation in the 
            world in this category. There are four components to the index of 
            economic freedom in the area of sound money; average annual growth 
            of the money supply in the last five years, the standard inflation 
            variability in the last five years, the recent inflation rate and 
            the freedom to own foreign currency bank accounts domestically and 
            abroad. In order to earn a high rating in this area, a country must 
            follow policies and adopt institutions that lead to low (and stable) 
            rates of inflation and avoid regulations that limit the use of 
            alternative currencies should citizens want to use them. <br>
            <br>
            In this year's report, Sweden tops the ranking in the area of Sound 
            Money followed by the United States in second position and Taiwan in 
            third. The United Arab Emirates is ranked 39th in the world, India 
            88th and Russia 112th. <br>
            <br>
            Commenting on the results, His Excellency Hamoud Sangour Al 
            Zadjali,ÊExecutive President of the Central Bank of Oman, said, &quot;The 
            Central Bank of Oman is committed to excellence in promoting 
            monetary and financial stability and fostering a sound and 
            progressive financial sector, to achieve sustained economic growth 
            for the benefit of the nation. The Sultanate has a liberal system 
            that reflects its basic non-interventionist stance of policy in 
            economic matters relating to the production and exchange of goods 
            and services.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Countries prosper when they establish an environment where 
            individuals can engage in productive activities and invest for the 
            future. Freeing people economically unleashes individual drive and 
            initiative and puts a nation on the road to economic growth. I am 
            please to see that the Sultanate's policies to create the conditions 
            are being recognised internationally,&quot; says Salem Ben Nasser Al 
            Ismaily, Executive President, OCIPED. <br>
            <br>
            On the success of the Sultanate in the EFW index, Neil Emerick, 
            Consultant, SEERS, says: &quot;The outlook for Oman's economy is very 
            positive. There seems to be a great willingness to embrace the 
            free-market ideology, which philosophically requires emphasis on 
            personal economic freedom. There is respect for this in government 
            tempered only by the specific Omani requirements - true of any small 
            nation - to maintain their culture and ways of life in an 
            increasingly global world. The degree to which the society is ready 
            for change will determine the pace of the economic reforms currently 
            underway.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Oman has much to sing about to the rest of the world and perhaps 
            has been a little shy in doing so,&quot; he adds. <br>
            <br>
            Fred McMahon, Director of the Centre for Trade and Globalisation 
            Studies at The Fraser Institute, believes that Oman is well 
            positioned to take advantage of the opportunities economic freedom 
            promotes and create an even better future, saying, &quot;The Sultanate 
            can forge a future where Omani and foreigner alike will continue to 
            invest and create jobs, prosperity and profit.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            He concludes: &quot;Oman has already shown tremendous commitment to and 
            growth in economic freedom. It is not a far stretch for Oman to 
            reach world-class best practices. The work OCIPED is spearheading 
            can take the Sultanate past that threshold. That will not eliminate 
            all challenges or difficulties but is the best path forward.&quot; </font>

            Size of government: expenditures, taxes and enterprises <br>
            Oman's score: 5.8 - Rank 67th</b> <br>
            <b>Summary:</b> Oman has a large, interventionist government. Often, 
            when a nation is young, the dominant requirement is institutional 
            stability. This manifests itself in a large, omni-present state. 
            However, the need to 'deepen' the diversity of the economy, away 
            from energy products, and generate a more sustainable economic 
            environment for Omanis, is crucial if Oman is to maintain (and grow) 
            its relatively high standards of living. The sub-categories in this 
            area show Oman's real deficiencies. In Area 1A (Government 
            consumption as a share of total consumption), Oman scores 1.4, which 
            puts it 120th out of 123 countries. Some commentators argue that 
            Oman's government is too dominant in the economy, crowding out other 
            players and raising the price of capital to the private sector. <br>
            This is also seen in Area 1C (Government enterprises and investment 
            as a percentage of GDP). Oman scores 2.0 and ranks 84th out of 123. 
            The Omani government is both the biggest consumer and producer of 
            goods in the economy that means it decides what products and 
            services are produced in the economy rather than the satisfaction of 
            consumer demand by innovative entrepreneurs. <br>
            <br>
            <b>2) Legal structure and security of property rights <br>
            Oman score: 6.9 - Rank 31st <br>
            Summary: </b>In Area 2B (impartial courts) Oman scores a very 
            respectable 7.4 (21st) and in Area 2E (integrity of the legal 
            system) the country rates 19th with a score of 8.3. There are gaps 
            in the information for Area 2A (judicial independence) but in our 
            interviews we were not left with any impression that Oman scored 
            poorly in this regard. There were questions of general levels of 
            competence, but not suspicion. There are also gaps in Area 2D 
            (protection of intellectual property), but there is much academic 
            debate about whether scoring well in this regard necessarily 
            correlates with positive growth. <br>
            <br>
            <b>3) Access to sound money <br>
            Oman Score: 9.7 - Rank 6th <br>
            Summary: </b>Oman has thrown its monetary lot in with the US, 
            linking the convertibility of its currency to the US dollar, and 
            thereby sharing a similar EFW score with the US (9.8). In light of 
            the dollar reserves Oman generates from the sale of petroleum 
            products, this has proved to be a very effective policy. However, 
            considerations regarding a GCC currency, the possibility of floating 
            verses fixed exchange rates, the volatility of the US dollar, and 
            the possibility of linking the Rial to a basket of goods, all add to 
            the complexity of choosing suitable policy for Oman going forward. 
            Currently though, Oman is a world-leader in offering its citizens a 
            stable currency upon which economic planning can be carried out. <br>
            <br>
            <b>4.) Freedom to trade with foreigners<br>
            Oman Score: 7.9 - Rank 31st <br>
            Summary:</b> Area 4 has many parameters measuring trade, though the 
            score has equal weight in the overall index (20%). And again, Oman 
            has world-class figures. In Area 4A (Taxes on international trade) 
            Oman scores 7th with 9.4. In Area 4E (capital market controls), Oman 
            ranks 54th, which suggests some work. There is no score on 
            regulatory trade barriers, (Area 4B), which is where an economy can 
            hide much of its xenophobia, but overall Oman would appear to be 
            very much open for international business. <br>
            <br>
            <b>5.) Regulation of credit, labour and business <br>
            Oman Score: 6.6 - Rank 22nd <br>
            Summary: </b>There are gaps in the index for Oman in two of these 
            parameters, which could suggest further transparency in the 
            respective sectors is required. Generally, things look very 
            positive. In the credit section, Oman scores 8.9 (13th), as the 
            banking sector is reasonably well developed and sees little 
            interference (in terms of regulating interest rates) from central 
            government. There is competition from international banks and there 
            exists private ownership of domestic banks. The absence of 
            unionisation in Oman is a significant factor in developing a fluid 
            labour market, but this is hindered (in terms of economic freedom) 
            by the requirements of Omanisation. It is worth noting that the 
            government has potentially disarmed critics by allowing for 100 per 
            cent ownership in certain industries, and low Omanisation 
            requirements (10 per cent) in their corporate structures. However, 
            certain sectors are regulated by high requirements and inevitably 
            this will place rigidities in the economy. As the Omani economy 
            grows, there will be increasing pressure from a migrant labour force 
            entering the market, and how Omanis choose to deal with this will be 
            crucial to political stability. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Future overview</b> How can Oman improve its position in the EFW 
            index? Much depends on the Omani government redefining its role in 
            the economy and ultimately extricating itself as a major player. The 
            liberal market philosophy (supported by empirical evidence for 
            countries experiencing long term growth) requires governments only 
            to create and maintain the political institutions that handle rules 
            and arbitration for the exchange of property. <br>
            <br>
            It is the degree to which government adopts the role of referee - 
            rather than player - that determines the long-term prosperity of a 
            nation. The government is seen as the employer of first resort and 
            privileges relating to Omanisation place further strain on the 
            attractiveness of Oman as a destination for entrepreneurs. The 
            future wealth of young Omanis will depend on how successfully the 
            government is able to withdraw itself from economic activity, 
            encouraging in its stead industrious and creative individuals.</font></p>

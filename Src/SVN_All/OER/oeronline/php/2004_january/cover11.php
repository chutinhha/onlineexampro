                    Blessed Renaissance, wisely led by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos 
                    bin Said, has, from the very beginning, charted a 
                    comprehensive plan for the future of the nation. His Majesty 
                    looks upon information as a bridge, linking the citizens and 
                    the officials and as a watchful eye that carefully monitors 
                    the development process. The information sector has gained 
                    special attention of His Majesty the Sultan and thus came 
                    the birth of the radio, television, newspapers and magazines 
                    - all enjoying an atmosphere of freedom, honesty and 
                    moderation. <br>
                    <br>
                    The nation achieved progress with stable steps and great 
                    speed. Today, we have a satellite television channel, a land 
                    television channel, a number of radio channels, five daily 
                    newspapers, many weekly and monthly magazines besides a host 
                    of other periodicals. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Omani information segment is well aware of the 
                    challenges facing it for the future development. It has, 
                    therefore, prepared itself for these challenges and is 
                    marching on with confidence. In carrying out its duty, the 
                    information sector relies on the latest technological 
                    advances in the media. <br>
                    <br>
                    The competition is, of course, stiff; but we have to cope 
                    with the development process.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is obvious that the citizens have many options available 
                    to them in terms of satellite channels, numerous magazines 
                    and newspapers. In other words, the market has the final 
                    say. <br>
                    <br>
                    The information sector is constantly on the move, always 
                    planning for further improvement through a process of 
                    self-criticism and analysis of other views. The aim is to 
                    achieve high standards and preserve the special Omani 
                    nature. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Omani media is making a big bet on the Omani youth who 
                    has proven its mettle in various fields. The media has given 
                    priority to the youth, provided it with opportunities and 
                    made numerous training courses available to it. <br>
                    <br>
                    The aim is to give the youth access to various international 
                    information schools and help them gain adequate experience. 
                    Many Omanis have distinguished themselves in the media. The 
                    information segment strongly roots for the process of 
                    Omanisation. <br>
                    <br>
                    There is one point to be noted: the information sector is 
                    very keen in preserving the Omani heritage and prides itself 
                    in having a distinguished Omani flavour. The essential 
                    qualities that characterise the onward march of the Omani 
                    information segment are optimism and confidence. </font></p>

                    Any effort to predict the future has only one certainty - 
                    the forecaster is sure to be at least partly wrong. I will, 
                    nevertheless, venture into discussing the future of the 
                    media industry. <br>
                    <br>
                    Media consumers include readers, viewers and users of media 
                    in various forms. For the sake of convenience, I will call 
                    them &quot;consumers&quot;. These consumers look at media as a source 
                    of information and entertainment. <br>
                    <br>
                    Media companies generate influence from their reach among 
                    consumers. Media is also an industry, generating revenue. 
                    This revenue comes mainly from advertisers, but can also 
                    include circulation/subscription revenue and other revenue. 
                    I will group all sources of media revenue together and label 
                    them &quot;customers&quot;. <br>
                    <br>
                    The influence that customers hope to have on their target 
                    audiences through any particular medium is only a function 
                    of the reach and influence that the medium itself has. As 
                    the relationship between customer and the medium progresses, 
                    the degree of influence becomes apparent and, ultimately, 
                    affects the revenue share allotted. Both dimensions of 
                    influence and revenue can thus be merged into one for this 
                    crystal gazing exercise. <br>
                    <br>
                    The media industry in Oman must be viewed as an industry, 
                    capable of generating revenue. In terms of Oman's national 
                    priorities, this industry is also a source of export 
                    earnings from overseas advertisers. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the chart, it is apparent that Oman has about 8 per cent 
                    share of per capita GDP in the GCC, but only a 3 per cent 
                    share of advertising spend. This 5 per cent gap is due to 
                    poor international perceptions of Oman's viability as a 
                    marketplace. Over the last two years, this perception is 
                    being corrected and figures for the first half of 2003 
                    indicate that Oman had the highest percentage growth of ad 
                    spend in the GCC. This process can generate substantial 
                    extra revenue for Oman's media and fuel further development 
                    in reaching the consumers. <br>

                    <br>
                    Let me consider the opportunities and threats to media in 
                    Oman and the Gulf region. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>a) Consumers </b><br>
                    There is a large shift in population patterns in the Gulf 
                    with young population growing in numbers and influence in 
                    society. As these new generations grow through new life 
                    stages, their consumption patterns as well as their outlook 
                    and values will have a major impact on their respective 
                    societies. <br>
                    <b>i) Opportunity:</b> New ideas and attitudes. More 
                    consumer spending on products and services. More female 
                    involvement in decision-making, especially true for Oman.
                    <br>
                    <b>ii) Threat:</b> Less newspaper reading. Worldwide, the 
                    younger generation reads far less. Media organisations are 
                    looking for ways to hold this segment. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>b) Advertising Customers</b> <br>
                    Media Buying and Planning shifting to specialised agencies.<br>
                    <b>i) Opportunity:</b> Media houses can develop 
                    relationships with consumer segments and develop insights 
                    into their lifestyles and habits. Thus they can encourage 
                    value-based buying. <br>
                    <b>ii) Threat:</b> There is the danger of media becoming a 
                    commodity with price-based buying and increasing reliance on 
                    databases cutting out well-established buyer-seller 
                    relationships in advertising. <br>

                    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Media Convergence</b> </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                    <br>
                    <b>Growth of Internet</b> <br>
                    Internet penetration in Oman and the region is low compared 
                    to other regions of the world with similar per-capita GDP.
                    <br>
                    <b>a. Impact on Consumer Base </b><br>
                    Few traditional consumers have been lost to Internet usage, 
                    but there is no cause for complacency in traditional media 
                    houses. There is a huge segment of the youth market that has 
                    never used old media and can potentially start their media 
                    experience through the Internet. <br>
                    <b>b. Impact on Customer Base </b><br>
                    Internet advertising has had no impact on advertising in 
                    traditional media and the share of new media in advertising 
                    budgets is miniscule. <br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Emergence of Mobile 
                    Technologies<br>
                    </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">a. The rapid growth 
                    of mobile technologies is a clear indication of media 
                    trends. In Oman, the boom in mobile phones was spurred by 
                    the introduction of the prepaid service and similarly for 
                    text messaging. <br>
                    b. Our preliminary survey of communication among Omani youth 
                    brought up one facet to merit further study. Text messaging 
                    in this segment appeared to be more a form of trading 
                    &quot;social currency&quot; than communication. This conclusion was 
                    based on the very high proportion of messages being 
                    &quot;forwards&quot; and not original compositions. <br>
                    My message to media houses is that they must not try to 
                    fight emerging media but use the opportunity to reach new 
                    segments and strengthen existing relationships. I believe 
                    that the media companies that prosper in the coming decade 
                    will be those that use their core competencies to gain an 
                    advantage in communication to the potential audience.<br>
                    <br>
                    These competencies include<br>

                    Media companies need to carefully nurture relations with 
                    consumers and customers and then manage these relations. 
                    They should try to build loyalty and improve frequency of 
                    use. This can be done through building relations with 
                    current and potential consumer audience segments and by 
                    actively seeking to enhance the knowledge of their consumer 
                    base and its relevance to customers.</font></p>

                    the past 10 years, we have seen how ICT products and 
                    services - be that end-user communication equipment; datacom 
                    and network equipment; computer hardware; office equipment; 
                    software products; IT services; or telecoms carrier services 
                    - have dramatically affected almost every aspect of our 
                    day-to-day lives. Today's information and communication 
                    technologies are enabling technologies, which means they 
                    underpin the competitiveness and efficient operation of all 
                    sectors of the Omani economy. <br>
                    <br>
                    Let us be clear, developments in ICT have an influence on 
                    everything, from how we explore for oil through to growing 
                    dates on the Batinah Coast. In fact, we are living in a 
                    world of technological ubiquity, a world in which an 
                    intelligent microwave warms up your dinner before you get 
                    home from the office, or your mobile phone tells you that 
                    your husband is still at the football match with the kids. 
                    In brief, we are entering a new age of always-on, anytime 
                    and anyplace technologies.<br>
                    <br>
                    But what does all this mean for Oman and its future 
                    development? In brief, as we move into the 21st century, our 
                    economic well-being, competitiveness and cultural richness 
                    will be significantly influenced by our ability to implement 
                    and develop intellectual capital and harness the power of 
                    ICT. Indeed, our success in areas such as business, 
                    education, health, tourism, innovation, research and 
                    security will all depend on our ability to accept and 
                    exploit ICT-based products and services. <br>
                    <br>
                    From a public policy perspective, ICT will increase the 
                    efficiency and reach of government services while decreasing 
                    the costs to business and citizens in interacting with 
                    government departments. Indeed, with the formation of the 
                    new National IT Task Force, we will see over the next 12 
                    months a much higher level of Web-based 
                    Government-2-Citizen, Government-2-Business and 
                    Government-2-Government interaction. <br>
                    <br>
                    This interactivity will only help improve the efficiency and 
                    productivity of the country's private and public sectors. In 
                    government as well as business, organisations which will 
                    benefit most from this transformative role of ICT are those 
                    that use ICT as a key strategic resource to achieve their 
                    goals rather than as a cold technical tool. <br>
                    <br>
                    Socially, ICT will contribute to greater social cohesion by 
                    providing better ways of linking Oman's remote communities 
                    into everyday national life. Omani fishermen already 
                    communicate by GSM as to where the best catches can be 
                    found. Even 10 years ago, this was not dreamt about as a 
                    possibility. Just think how technology might be helping them 
                    10 years from now.<br>
                    <br>
                    A host of ICT business opportunities exist, for example, 
                    developing online Arabic content for the Internet, as well 
                    as Arabising software. In more general terms, ICT will 
                    expand the opportunities for economic and social 
                    participation by Omanis of all ages and backgrounds. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, to achieve all this, considerable effort and 
                    leadership will be required. High-level leadership from 
                    government, business and education. It is these three groups 
                    that will promote the important role of ICT in the 
                    achievement of wider national goals. Indeed, some of the ICT 
                    issues that these three groups will have to address include:

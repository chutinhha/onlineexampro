                    components that make up Oman's tourism product include our 
                    culture, our history, our people and our natural landscapes 
                    and seas with which God has blessed us. These allow us to 
                    offer activity, cultural, adventure and experience holidays. 
                    These same components determine the image of Oman that we 
                    wish to portray. Together with our publications, style of 
                    advertising, media used, messages given create the &quot;Brand 
                    Oman&quot;.<br>
                    <br>
                    The brand through which we attract tourists that are 
                    compatible with what we offer and who will be comfortable in 
                    our social environment. <br>
                    <br>
                    In Oman, we have added another element to our marketing mix. 
                    We have added partnership. <br>
                    <br>
                    Firstly, we recognise that multi-destination holidays are a 
                    preference for many tourists and that we are a long-haul 
                    destination for many of our markets. We see the potential 
                    for multi-destination holidays in the Gulf. We are already 
                    in multi-destination packages with some of our neighbours. 
                    We have already made agreements with some of our neighbours 
                    to collaborate on visa formalities. It is our intention to 
                    pursue more actively the creation of such multi-destination 
                    partnership packaging with our neighbours and with our 
                    overseas tour operators. <br>
                    <br>
                    We are in discussions with our airlines, particularly Gulf 
                    Air and Oman Air, to coordinate our marketing activities and 
                    to be partners in the marketplace. This will involve sharing 
                    in Trade and Consumer fairs, in promotional events, in 
                    advertising and in research. We are talking to our partners, 
                    the tour operators in our source markets, to strengthen and 
                    expand our marketing activities as partners for promoting 
                    and advertising Oman on a shared partnership basis. <br>
                    <br>
                    Our own industry in Oman - our hoteliers, our local tour 
                    operators, our product providers - have worked together with 
                    us for many years. However, we recognise a need to 
                    strengthen this partnership. We need to share more 
                    information on market intelligence, to share decision-making 
                    on marketing planning and marketing strategy.<br>
                    <br>
                    We see our future success being more dependent on a strong 
                    partnership with the market-based tour operators, the 
                    airlines, our Oman-based industry and the Ministry acting in 
                    unison as true tourism partners. It will entail the

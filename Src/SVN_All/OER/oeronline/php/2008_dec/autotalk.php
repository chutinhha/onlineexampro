				NEW BEGINNING<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Luxury cars are not 
				something we would normally associate with Korean cars, but 
				Hyundai was looking to change that image. MALCOLM XAVIER CRASTA 
				WRITES<br>
				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="autot1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Hyundai’s primary objective, with the Genesis, was to create a 
				high performance luxury car to compete with the likes of Lexus, 
				BMW, Cadillac and others. And by what we saw, it seems that they 
				have succeeded… well almost. Hyundai decided to take a very 
				conservative approach in designing the exterior of the Genesis. 
				It looks like a concoction of design elements from various cars 
				that, somehow, just seem to fit right in. Look carefully and you 
				will see a hint of Mercedes in the shapely grille, a bit of 
				Lexus in the contours of the car, a touch of the 5-series in the 
				tail lights. However, the end result is a very elegant car that 
				is tasteful yet derivative and if it wasn’t for the badge on the 
				back it would be indistinguishable as a Hyundai.<br>
				<br>
				Inside though, Hyundai a lot bolder with its design. You will 
				find a bevy of soft touch materials, lashings of leather and 
				interior hues, completely unseen in any Hyundai to date. 
				Everything, from the leather wrapped dash to the glossy wood 
				accents on the doors, is fitted with meticulous attention to 
				detail. The seats are as comfortable as they look and there is 
				ample articulation in the seats and the steering to fit in even 
				the most hefty of drivers. As comfortable as they are though, 
				the seats lack the bolstering that is provided by some of its 
				competitors. At the back you will have easily one of the most 
				spacious cabins at your disposal, and seats that are as 
				comfortable as you will find upfront.<br>
				<br>
				Once in the driver’s seat, all readouts are delivered to you via 
				a very tasteful instrument panel with white-on-black gauges. 
				Although not all controls are in the most ergonomic of places, 
				it is a small price to pay for such an elegant design. The 
				central attraction of the cabin though is the screen, called the 
				Driver Information Display, at the top of the centre console. It 
				uses a similar knob-joystick control system as you will find in 
				a BMW and every control is just the right number of clicks away.<br>
				<br>
				At present Hyundai gets only one model of the vehicle here and 
				you get pretty much everything that you would expect a luxury 
				car to have. <br>
				<br>
				You get a smart key system, hydraulic air suspensions, auto 
				dimming mirrors, media and climate controls for the rear seats, 
				mood lighting and much more. And to please all audiophiles, 
				Hyundai also has a Lexicon sound system that comes standard with 
				the car, otherwise only found on Rolls Royce. Also included with 
				the audio package is a very smart auxiliary port that can 
				utilise a USB flash drive, a direct audio jack or even an iPod, 
				which can be controlled from the driver information system.<br>
				<br>
				Once on the road, the Genesis is one of the quietest cars in its 
				class with only a hint of wind noise at high speeds. The ride 
				itself is calm and composed and the damping is good. The car’s 
				air suspensions are height-adjustable and have two modes, normal 
				and sport. Regardless of the setting it is geared more towards 
				comfort than handling. Through corners, the effect of its weight 
				combined with the softness of the suspensions is noticeable but 
				can be improved by switching into sport mode. On a whole it 
				handles quite well with a dose of controllable oversteer thrown 
				into the mix. Powered by a 3.8 litre V6 producing 390hp, the 
				Genesis offers brisk straight line performance, thanks to the 
				very capable 6-speed automatic transmission. In auto, the shifts 
				are perfect and the acceleration is smooth but shift it manually 
				and it tends to get a bit sluggish with noticeably delayed shift 
				times.<br>
				<br>
				On the whole, this is one of the best first attempts at a luxury 
				car we have seen in a long time and is definitely the best 
				Korean car on the market. Also Hyundai’s recent reliability 
				record makes it a safe buy. The only thing that may hold you 
				back is that, although prices are not revealed, it will 
				definitely cost somewhere in the high teens and some may see 
				that as too much for a Hyundai. But believe us, this car is 
				really as good as it looks. It will perfectly suit anyone in the 
				market for a luxury family car and is not badge conscious. </font></p>

				Ali</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
				&nbsp;</b></font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">According to World Investment 
				Report, issued by the World Conference on Trade and Development 
				(UNCTAD), inbound FDI in Saudi Arabia averaged merely $245mn for 
				the period spanning 1990 to 2000. This figure shot upto $12.1bn 
				in 2005 and to $18.3bn in 2006.<br>
				<br>
				In 2007 inward FDI amounted to $24.3bn, showing a hefty growth 
				of 33 per cent. This was the highest amount achieved by any 
				nation in West Asia including fellow members from the Gulf 
				Cooperation Council (GCC). Turkey emerged second with FDI 
				inflows of $22bn. For its part, the UAE attracted $13.3bn of FDI, 
				in turn the third highest amount in West Asia and the second 
				best within the GCC. <br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="194" height="352" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Sustained 
				reforms</b><br>
				The extraordinary progress relates to on-going economic reforms 
				designed to turn Saudi Arabia into a key international hub for 
				investment. The reforms gained momentum some ten years ago 
				reflecting an official drive to join the World Trade 
				Organisation (WTO). Saudi Arabia acceded to WTO in December 2005 
				following a decade-long protracted negotiation. The kingdom was 
				the last GCC state to get membership of the WTO.<br>
				<br>
				Of all the moves, credit must be given to the foreign investment 
				law (FIL), enacted in April 2000. The law allows foreign firms 
				to own a majority stake in companies within the kingdom. The 
				maximum income tax rate for foreign firms has been reduced from 
				45 percent in 2000 to 20 per cent. In addition, Saudi Arabian 
				General Investment Authority (Sagia), which looks after foreign 
				investments, has put in place a one-stop-shop application 
				process besides a 30-day deadline for decisions on investment 
				applications.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Negative list</b><br>
				Conversely, the bill barred foreign investments in around 22 
				areas including exploration, drilling and production of oil, and 
				thereby dubbed as a “negative list”. However, officials have 
				since eased restrictions, granting foreign investors the 
				opportunity to invest in such sectors as insurance services, 
				wholesale and retail trade, air and train transport, and 
				communication services. Thanks to the Supreme Economic Council 
				(SEC), currently the list includes 13 barred activities. SEC 
				develops and oversees economic policies in the kingdom.<br>
				<br>
				As part of WTO accession, Saudi authorities agreed to grant 60 
				per cent foreign equity shareholding to joint projects. In 
				addition it changed laws allowing the setting up of foreign 
				banks in the form of locally incorporated joint stock companies 
				or as branches of international financial institutions.<br>
				<br>
				To be sure, investors like to invest in Saudi Arabia as it has 
				the largest gross domestic product (GDP) in the region. IMF 
				statistics put Saudi Arabia’s GDP in current terms at $380bn in 
				2007. Saudi GDP is set to cross the $0.5trn mark in the not too 
				distant future unless oil prices drop substantially. Amongst 
				other characteristics, the Saudi economy boasts of a consumer 
				market throughout the year. The country attracts a number of 
				religious tourists for the annual Haj and Umra (little Haj that 
				maybe performed at anytime). Around seven million people visit 
				the Grand Mosque annually, with the figure expected to double in 
				the next 10 years.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Addressing challenges</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="close2.jpg" width="350" height="275" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Inbound 
				FDI should help in overcoming unemployment amongst locals and 
				strengthening the kingdom’s competitiveness. According to the 
				Ministry of Economy and Planning, the unemployment rate amongst 
				the national workforce stood at 11.2 per cent in the first half 
				of 2007. The government needs to create some 160,000 jobs to do 
				away with existing unemployed and to cater to new entrants 
				joining the workforce. Saudi economy needs foreign investments 
				in industrial undertakings, to create employment opportunities.<br>
				<br>
				Undoubtedly, the government cannot overlook the employment 
				problem amongst locals because of its implications. For one, 
				extremist groups often find recruits amongst the jobless. Close 
				to 38 per cent of Saudi nationals are below the age of 14 and 
				hence expected to enter the job market before soon.<br>
				<br>
				A key challenge relates to ensuring the availability of jobs 
				that meet the requirements of Saudi nationals. At stake is not 
				just creating enough employment opportunities per se, but the 
				right ones for Saudi nationals. The Saudis do not just desire 
				some jobs that an expatriate maybe willing to undertake. The 
				fact remains that Saudis do not want jobs like providing menial 
				services in return for relatively low wages, like in the 
				construction sector. The issue is not whether this is right or 
				wrong, but a given in the kingdom. Certainly, such attitudes 
				could change in the end through rehabilitation and training. 
				However, Saudi officials do not have the luxury of letting 
				unemployment rates to shoot up any further.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Aiming high</b><br>
				Saudi Arabia is also looking at breaking into the ranks of the 
				top ten most competitive economies in the world by 2010. To be 
				sure, there is plenty of good news. The Global Competitiveness 
				Report for 2008-2009 has ranked Saudi Arabia at number 35 in the 
				world amongst 134 economies covered in the study. As such, the 
				kingdom has advanced 9 notches in a span of one year. The World 
				Economic Forum issues the annual report that ranks economies 
				based on their Growth Competitiveness. In turn, the index relies 
				on three broad categories of basic requirements, efficiency 
				enhancers and innovation and sophistication factors.<br>
				<br>
				FDI helps in fulfilling long-term commitments such as 
				establishing industrial undertakings. Hence, investments in 
				stock markets do not constitute FDI, as they have the tendency 
				of relocating at any point of time. Countries throughout the 
				world seek foreign investments partly to help them address the 
				job problem for nationals and to improve their economic 
				prospects.<br>
				<br>
				The performance of Saudi economy demonstrates that sustained 
				reforms can improve economic prospects, and in turn help in 
				addressing challenges. To conclude, over the past few years 
				Saudi officials showed determination in streamlining 
				legislations and laws related to foreign investments in the 
				country. The authorities need to continue this path of having a 
				more liberalised economy with limited government intervention.

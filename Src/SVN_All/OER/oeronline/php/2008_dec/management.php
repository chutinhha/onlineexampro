				<b>The third Infiniti Power Talk delivered by Mind Mapping Guru 
				– Tony Buzan empowered Oman’s powerful business leaders with 
				effective inputs on creative thinking and leadership<br>
				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="manage.jpg" width="225" height="267" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Tony Buzan, the inventor of Mind Mapping techniques was recently 
				in Oman on an invitation from Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA) to 
				present the Third Infiniti Power Talk. The SBA initiative brings 
				together business leaders for an invigorating session with a 
				management guru. Infiniti Power Talk Series provides them with 
				ideas on business success. Says T Venkataraman, vice president, 
				sales, marketing and customer satisfaction, SBA, “We call this 
				power talk as it is essentially about people who want to get 
				into power or who are powerful.”<br>
				<br>
				Buzan is a renowned brain researcher who popularised the notion 
				that memory is a learned skill. According to him, creative 
				thinking is the ability to come up with new ideas and this is 
				made possible by making a new association or connection. In 
				simple terms, “creative thinking is a product of associations.” 
				Buzan has devoted a lot of his time helping business leaders 
				grapple with business situations and come up with a range of 
				solutions for the problems that they face. His strategies on 
				working a mind map have contributed to many breakthroughs in 
				organisational and retention problems. His new Mind Map product 
				which is the downloadable iMindMap software, has paved the way 
				for businesses to come up with easier and effective methods in 
				functioning better. Mind Mapping is an efficient way of 
				utilising the most valuable human resource – one’s mind power.<br>
				<br>
				During the Power Talk Buzan explained that Mind Map is an 
				expression of radiant thinking and is therefore a natural 
				function of the human mind. It is a powerful graphic technique 
				which provides a universal key to unlocking the potential of the 
				brain. The Mind Map can be applied to every aspect of business 
				like people management, vision building, short and long-term 
				planning, change management where improved learning and clearer 
				thinking will enhance human performance. Mind Maps aid in 
				creative thinking by increasing the speed and ease of coming up 
				with creative ideas which are immensely helpful to today’s 
				business leaders in handling the rapidly changing business 
				environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The evolution<br>
				</b>When Buzan first stared this work, he found it difficult to 
				make people recognise their untapped power. People always read 
				countless reports about how it is possible to achieve global 
				domination, however, what has been missing up until now was a 
				guide on how to achieve this. Buzan’s fundamental goal is to 
				have every single person in the world to be mentally literate. 
				Being mentally literate means to know that their brains and 
				bodies work and how thinking and cognitive functions work. 
				Basically he wants everybody to have the operations manual for 
				his or her own brain. And everything he does is directed towards 
				that. His teachings and systems are instrumental in helping 
				structure many a business campaigns and have worked in 
				developing strategies for businesses and corporations like 
				Microsoft, IBM, Walt Disney, British Petroleum, Mexican and 
				Chinese governments, Oracle, Xerox, IBM, HSBC, Irish Management 
				Institute, Hong Kong Institute of Management and many of The 
				Fortune 1000 companies.<br>
				<br>
				During the 3rd Infiniti Power Talk the master mind presented his 
				ideas and analogies which the corporate heads present agreed 
				would surely help them understand the importance of memory’s 
				grasping power and retention. It turned out to be an inspiring 
				evening as Buzan hoisted the concept of creative thinking 
				through mind maps and the importance of improving your memory 
				power. This third session of the Infiniti Power Talk contained a 
				host of ideas, motivating statements, thought-provoking tests 
				and challenging questions. Audience participation was at a high 
				which added huge value to the evening. Participants came away 
				with his autographed best selling book – The Ultimate Book of 
				Mind Maps which contains proven strategies and techniques to 
				build an infinite route to one’s mind. The Infiniti Power Talk 
				was born from Infiniti’s brand values – its commitment to 
				innovation and the nurturing of great ideas. At the heart of the 
				Infiniti Power Talk is a belief that ideas can change the world.

							<b>Tony Buzan, the creator of Mind Map speaks to OER’s
				Mayank Singh on the sidelines of the third Infiniti Power Talk
							<br>
				<br>
				What sets apart Mind Map?</b><br>
				It is like the Swiss Army knife of the brain. It is a thinking 
				tool that helps you to map your thoughts. If someone is planning 
				to do business in Oman or is a CEO then the technique will help 
				them in making decisions. One can either place a flag of Oman or 
				a picture of the country and then draw individual branches for 
				its geography, history, politics, business, people, culture, 
				music and so on. This helps in getting a microscope view of 
				things and compressing almost 20 pages of information on a 
				single sheet. Human memory is a tool which is much more powerful 
				than what we think and Mind Mapping helps us to harness this.<br>
							<br>
							<b>How did Map Mapping evolve?</b><br>
				It started in my student days as I discovered that despite 
				putting in a good effort my marks were going down, so I made 
				more notes but despite this my marks fell further. It was then 
				that I realised that the problem was in the way that I was 
				noting my thoughts – this was both a shock and a discovery. As 
				Mind Map evolved, I felt that I had been driving throughout my 
				life with a dusty wind screen in front and that it was finally 
				being cleared off.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Are there companies which are putting the technique to good use?</b><br>
				There are very few well known organisations which are not using 
				Mind Maps. Microsoft, Nissan, IBM, Intel, BP, Walt Disney, 
				Kuwait Petroleum, the Mexican and Chinese governments have all 
				used Mind Maps. Boeing saved $12mn by using the technique while 
				constructing a building. Leaders in New York used Mind Maps in 
				the wake of the 9/11 crisis to arrive at faster decisions. Al 
				Gore, the former US vice president uses Mind Maps for his 
				environment awareness campaigns.<br>
							<br>
							<b>How are you disseminating knowledge about the technique?<br>
							</b>I have a team of 300 licensed instructors who teach Mind Maps. 
				Apart from my lectures I am also an ambassador for ‘Help the 
				Aged’ an organisation which helps old people. Mind Mapping helps 
				us to make our minds stronger as we age. I have written and 
				co-authored 98 books, so you can say that I am 98 and not out in 
				cricket parlance.</font></td>

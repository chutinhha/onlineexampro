			potential of the Middle Kingdom<br>

			<img border="0" src="peri.jpg" width="125" height="148" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Economics helped put Barack Obama in the White House and economics 
			will obsess the next White House. The 900 point drop in the Dow 
			Jones in the two days after the election was a vivid symbol of the 
			macroeconomic malaise that afflicts America. The US recession that 
			began last spring is deepening. The jobless rate could well be 
			headed to eight per cent, the Detroit auto colossi could well not 
			survive the next 100 days as the chairman of GM Richard Wagoner 
			hinted. The ISM collapse shows that the consumer recession has now 
			broadened to manufacturing. While home prices are no longer in free 
			fall, homeowners have been traumatised by the wealth effect and have 
			now begun to slash their credit card debts.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Gloom ahead</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="peri1.jpg" width="175" height="408" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The plunge in retail sales, auto sales and University of Michigan 
			consumer confidence index all prove conclusively that the global 
			consumer faces his worst downturn since the Reagan slump of the 
			early 1990s. The Bernanke Fed and the US Treasury have managed to 
			unthaw the frozen money markets, with three month LIBOR (London 
			Interbank Overnight Rate) now down to 2.3 per cent, 250 basis points 
			below the October peak of 4.82 per cent. Three month LIBOR is now at 
			its lowest since the failure of Lehman Brothers. The unfrozen money 
			markets and Obama’s election also means that the dollar’s frantic 
			rise against the Euro and Asian currencies may now decelerate.<br>
			<br>
			Fiscal stimulus, the traditional Democratic calls for a weak dollar, 
			a trillion dollar budget deficit swelled by bailouts of Wall Street 
			banks and (potentially) Detroit, a Fed funds rate of only one per 
			cent and grim macro data (ISM, retail sales, Chicago PMI, payrolls) 
			all would argue for a lower dollar.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Political fallout</b><br>
			Obama’s constituencies in the US trade unions, the Midwest and 
			Detroit automakers could also demand a hawkish, even protectionist 
			rhetoric against China, whose yuan policy has anchored its 
			phenomenal export growth. Obama has publicly branded China a 
			currency manipulator and unlike Paulson, could well cause the 
			Chinese to appreciate the yuan against the dollar.<br>
			<br>
			Financial distress is palpable in China’s Guangdong province, the 
			export epicenter of the Middle Kingdom. Thousands of export 
			sweatshop factories face closure. Chinese GDP growth is slowing down 
			and the threat of protectionist legislation in a Democratic Congress 
			could limit the ability of the Politburo to slow down the pace of 
			yuan appreciation at the precise moment Chinese exporters can least 
			afford it.<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="peri2.jpg" width="200" height="163" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5">While the Chinese yuan has appreciated more than 20 per cent against 
			the dollar since it abandoned the peg in July 2005, its next trend 
			could be a 5-8 per cent depreciation as its trade surplus shrinks, 
			exports plummet in the global market and the protectionist decibel 
			count rises in Washington. The Bank of England’s 150 basis point 
			rate cut shocked the currency markets and reflects the UK’s swift 
			decent into recession. The macro disaster from the housing free 
			fall, nationalisation of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS Plc and the 
			freeze in bank credit, job losses in the city of London can only 
			prove bearish for sterling and the Euro. Even the collapse of 
			sterling against the dollar has not really helped UK exporters as 
			global demand softens.<br>
			<br>
			With oil prices at $60, sterling’s role as a haven to recycle Arab 
			petrodollars is also over and there is no high yield argument for 
			sterling reserves for Arab central banks now that the base rate is 
			three per cent. I believe that we have not bottomed on sterling, 
			that the High Street banks (including Barclays) will need to raise 
			more capital, that Britain’s GDP contraction will be worse than the Eurozone or the US. So I expect sterling to fall even more against 
			the dollar to 1.48 and against the Euro to 0.85.<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="peri3.jpg" width="322" height="236" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">I am also negative on the Canadian dollar, which benefited 
			disproportionately from investment flows in Canada’s Alberta tar 
			sands and the gold, commodities stocks listed on the Toronto and 
			Vancouver exchanges. However, at $57 Brent, the Canadian tar sands 
			are uneconomic.<br>
			<br>
			Moreover, Canadian exports to the US which are dominated by auto 
			parts and forestry products, will be decimated by the woes of 
			Detroit and the homebuilders. The GM chairman even warned that the 
			next 100 days could see a bankruptcy filing without a bailout from 
			Washington. The bear markets in commodities will be protracted, as 
			both China and Indian GDP growth softens. The Canadian dollar could 
			well fall to 1.25 against the greenback in the next quarter.

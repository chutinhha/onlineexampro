				Scaling-Up</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<b>Despite being a late entrant in the Middle East market, the 
				Malaysian auto major Proton has chalked out an aggressive plan 
				to penetrate the regional market. Akshay Bhatnagar reports from 
				Malaysia<br>
				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="auto8.jpg" width="250" height="203" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">When you think of Malaysia, the visuals of natural rubber, palm 
				oil and picturesque coastal plains and mountains come to mind 
				immediately. But the Southeast Asian nation is also home to 
				Proton, a major automobile group that employs 12,000 people. 
				Though Proton may be a lesser known brand internationally 
				compared to the much fancied Japanese, European, American and 
				even Korean auto brands but it has been steadily ramping up its 
				production facilities, engineering knowledge and distribution 
				network over the years. Proton entered Oman in 2006 in 
				partnership with Al Hashar and Company.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Looking Ahead</b><br>
				Proton started in 1983 as part of a national initiative to 
				spearhead the automotive industrialisation in Malaysia. 
				Currently, the 25-year old company has emerged as the largest 
				manufacturer of automobiles in Malaysia. It enjoys a major chunk 
				of the domestic market in the passenger car segment. It also has 
				a sizeable distribution network in international markets 
				including Southeast Asia, Middle East, Western Europe 
				specifically UK and Australasia.<br>
				<br>
				On the product range and engineering capability front, Proton 
				group claims to have the expertise and technology to build 
				small, medium, large size, sports cars, SUVs and MPVs besides 
				the knowledge of building military vehicles, motorcycles, light 
				aircrafts and watercrafts. Its current offerings include 
				four-door family vehicles, two-door hatchbacks, executive 
				sedans, as well as the world renowned sports cars from Lotus 
				(Proton subsidiary).<br>
				<br>
				The group has research centres based in Malaysia and UK to 
				develop new technologies to create new autos. Through Lotus, the 
				group provides consultancy services to number of OEMs and tier 1 
				suppliers. Overall, the group has spent RM4.3bn (one Omani Riyal 
				is equal to approximately 9.4 Malaysian Ringgit) in R&amp;D over the 
				last five years and it has committed another RM5bn in the next 
				five years.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="auto9.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Talking about the company’s strategy for business growth, 
				Proton’s managing director Dato’ Haji Syed Zainal Abidin B Syed 
				Mohamed Tahir said, “Due to the ongoing global financial crisis, 
				everyone is reviewing their business strategies. We have been 
				cautious in our financial management. We don’t expect to face 
				any major impact of the financial turmoil on our business. We 
				are going ahead with our expansion plans. The launch of Persona 
				(the new 1.6L executive sedan) in the international market 
				including Middle East is a step that direction. Persona is our 
				core model and wherever it has been launched it has received an 
				encouraging response.” Proton has stated that it has already 
				made over 59,000 bookings for Persona in Malaysia alone.<br>
				<br>
				Adding on, he said, “We are also going to launch an MPV soon 
				with the help of Lotus. It will further solidify our product 
				line-up to include a high quality multi-purpose vehicle that can 
				cater to the family-oriented contemporary lifestyle. We need to 
				understand the Middle East market more. We are looking at turbo 
				engines by 2010-11. It will be equivalent to 2.0L. We are also 
				embarking on more fuel efficient engines. We are also planning 
				for diesel variants as they are quite popular in markets such as 
				India which we are eying. We are in discussion with a renowned 
				international level OEM for it. We are also looking at 
				developing a small competitive car. We expect to make it 
				available by 2010. We are working on hybrid and electric 
				technologies. We are also moving towards reducing the weight of 
				our cars. We may also look at the development of a car jointly 
				with Lotus which is more affordable.”<br>
				<br>
				Lotus has also unveiled a brand new thoroughbred named Evora, 
				the first new Lotus model to be launched in over 13 years. It is 
				expected to be launched in 2009. On the long term market 
				strategy, he said, “our strategy for the next 10 years is to 
				focus on ASEAN, China, Russia and India besides other markets. 
				We expect Middle East to be a very important market for us. We 
				are considering how Iran could help us in supporting the ME 
				market. We have hired an ex-Toyota auto expert to focus on 
				improving quality as per the requirements for exports market.”<br>
				<br>
				Proton is aiming at setting up production facilities in overseas 
				markets as well as Dato’ Haji said, “Towards achieving economies 
				of scale, Proton will maximise localisation to reduce cost and, 
				where a certain level of scale is achieved and commercially 
				viable, there is potential for production hubs to be established 
				in the respective targeted high-growth markets, translating to 
				cost competitiveness and complementation of key components.”<br>
				<br>
				Though competition is going to be tough for Proton in most of 
				the markets it is penetrating, but a sustained effort to meet 
				the customer’s demand for contemporary features at affordable 
				cost and excellent after sales service could make it a winner.</font></p>

				recently launched its latest model Persona. Talking about the 
				new model, Werner Koch, CEO of Al Hashar Group of Companies, 
				Proton’s sole distributor in Oman said, “Persona is a model that 
				will get noticed and attract people not only for its looks but 
				its practicality, smooth ride and fuel economy”. Oman is the 
				third country in the Middle East to launch Persona after Saudi 
				Arabia and Egypt. <br>
							<br>
				Persona promises to offer advanced styling, generous interior 
				and expansive luggage space to the user. The vehicle engineered 
				by Lotus is powered by the enhanced 16-valve DOHC Campro IAFM 
				(intake air fuel module) engine aimed at delivering smooth 
				drivability and riding comfort. It offers a displacement of 
				1597cc with manual or automatic transmission and acceleration 
				from 0 to 100km/h in 12.4 seconds. It is equipped with dual 
				airbags, ABS, EBD and auto-lock system. It is available in four 
				colours including solid white, metal grey, tranquility black and 
				solid red. The model won the ‘Best Model of the Year for 
				Malaysia’ at the 2008 Frost &amp; Sullivan Automotive Awards for the 
				South East Asian (ASEAN) markets. <br>

			<b>Dr Andy Wood, Shell Country Chairman has struck a perfect balance

			</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="person.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">A theatre enthusiast,
avid sailor, geologist
and oil man – Dr
Andy Wood, Shell
Country Chairman for
Oman, is a man with
multifarious talents. A self-confessed
perfectionist, Dr Wood has pursued
his work and hobbies with a similar
determination and passion, learning
and drawing from all his experiences.
As he settles down on a sofa in his office
for an interview, one notices that
his conversations are intercepted with
thoughtful pauses. An unhurried and
calm demeanour reflects a man who is
at ease with himself and his surroundings.
He says in a philosophical vein,
“Exploration for oil and gas is as much
an art as a science. When you drill a
well it rarely turns out quite the way
you expect; sometimes it is better and
sometimes it is worse, but always different.
So it is important to have some
humility and keep in mind not just
what one knows but how much one
doesn’t know!” A career geologist himself,
his experience in the oil and gas
business seems to have left an imprint
on his personality.
<br>
			<br>
			<b>Going back a long way
<br>
			</b>Accompanying his parents on trekking
holidays around Britain during
his growing years kindled an interest in
physical geography. Taking up geology
at university was a natural progression
of this childhood interest. After reading Natural Sciences at Cambridge, he went
on to study for a doctorate at Oxford. Dr
Wood recollects the excitement of his
college days in the early 1970s as revolutionary
new concepts in geology like
plate tectonics and sea-floor spreading
were taking shape at that time. As a student
he was privileged to interact with
lecturers who were teaching these concepts
as they developed.
<br>
			<br>
			He joined Shell in 1980 and has now
worked with the oil and gas major for
almost 29 years. Dr Wood fondly remembers
the first of his three tenures in
Oman way back in 1981 as a young exploration
geologist seconded to Petroleum
Development Oman (PDO). “It was
an exciting time; we were shooting seismic,
drilling wells and making discoveries
of some of the big fields in South
Oman like Nimr.” He came back to the
Sultanate in 1992 as PDO’s Exploration
Director at the time that major new gas
discoveries in Central Oman were being
appraised. His third posting to Oman as
a Shell Country Chairman in September
2003 has thus been a homecoming of
sorts for Dr Wood.
<br>
			<br>
			<b>Sailor at heart
</b><br>
			Like geology, it was another childhood
experience that planted the seeds of
a lifelong passion for sailing in him.
Says Wood, “I got into sailing by reading
Arthur Ransome’s Swallows and
Amazons series of children’s books.
These were not only great adventure
stories but also served as very effective
sailing manuals, explaining all
the principles of sailing.” Coming
from a family of walkers rather than
sailors, he found little encouragement
at home to pursue sailing. It was only at University that he finally got a
chance to pursue his childhood dream
of sailing across the English Channel
to France and the Channel Islands.
<br>
			<br>
			He recalls a terrifying sailing experience
on one such trip, finding himself
in the shipping lanes off France
armed only with a compass, an echo
sounder and a small foghorn on a day
when thick fog clouded visibility completely.
“We could hear the engines of
passing ships without seeing them till
they were at very close range which
was pretty scary,” says Dr Wood. Undeterred,
he has gone on to either own
a boat or to charter one during his
postings around the globe. Though he
enjoys sailing in Oman and is an avid
supporter of the ‘Oman Sail’ initiative
his work commitments don’t allow
him to sail as often as he would like.
“And the wind never seems to blow on
a weekend!” He bemoans. His post retirement
plans include sailing around
Great Britain and Ireland.</font></p>

			<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>A performer at heart
</b><br>
			Theatre is a passion that he shares with
his better half, Tricia, who besides acting,
used to be part of the Welsh folk
group as a teenager. Dr Wood himself
has been a part of performing art groups
since his school days. He still cherishes
the part of Face that he played in The
Alchemist whilst at school. “It gave me
a chance to impersonate all sorts of different
characters,” he says.
The couple has been involved during
their Oman postings with the Muscat
Amateur Theatre group since 1982
when they both appeared in Table Manners. Says Wood, “It is nice to do
something that is a complete break
from work, artistic and – hopefully
– appreciated by the community.”
As every actor on stage is dependent
on each other, he believes that
stage performances teach people to
operate effectively as teams. “A production
is after all only as strong as
its weakest link.”
<br>
			<br>
			He chuckles recalling a production of
Noises Off in Nigeria. As the expatriate
community was small, by the time
the play was staged almost every member
of the community was involved
with some aspect of the play and it
took some effort to find an audience to
watch it!
<br>
			<br>
			<b>Leadership traits
<br>
			</b>Having risen through the ranks to the
highest echelons of the corporate sector,
Dr Wood feels that the most important
ability for the head of an organisation
is an ability to communicate, both
with his team and to the outside world.
“If the head of an organisation is aloof
from his customers and staff then the
company cannot move forward. A leader
needs to have a vision and should be
able to communicate this to the people
around him. They need a clear idea of
where the organisation they are part
of is going, and what they are there
to do.” As the Exploration Director of PDO, his office used to overlook the
sea where the sight of tankers lined up
ready to load crude for export provided
a powerful reminder of what he was
in Oman to achieve. As a manager he
believes in setting targets for his team
and giving them the space to achieve
them. Having spent his entire career
in technical and techno-managerial
jobs his posting as the Shell Country
Chairman proved to be a new learning
experience for Dr Wood. “It was a
job that required a different skill set, in
particular relationship management.”
His knowledge and love of Oman
and his experience however helped
him to settle in his new avatar with
relative ease.
<br>
			<br>
			He looks back with obvious pride on
a number of things – one, the way a
generation of Shell people like him
have contributed to the development
of PDO into a world class oil and gas
company and how capable and experienced
people from PDO have gone on
to make their mark across various sectors
of the economy. “I have enjoyed
coaching, mentoring and working
alongside talented Omanis throughout
my career.” Dr Wood is himself
an embodiment of the best traditions
of Shell and PDO.</font></p>

			</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Dr Nasser Zaher Nasser 
			Al Mauly, CEO, A’Saffa Poultry Farms, stuns you with his 
			never-say-die attitude both professionally and personally. He 
			believes in and has immersed himself in the maxim ‘living life to 
			the fullest’<br>
			</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="board.jpg" width="250" height="244" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">There are two things on the desk of 
			Dr Nasser Al Mauly which pretty much sum up our ‘Beyond Boardroom’ 
			story – a small yellow fluffy chicken and a golf ball. But there is 
			no need to ask the question – what came first the chicken or the 
			egg? Because, as Chief Executive Officer of A’Saffa Poultry it is 
			certainly the chicken that matters most for Dr Mauly, come what may.<br>
			<br>
			For someone who chose to pursue agriculture for his studies and 
			later having his own private farm, it was a natural progression to 
			take up the yeomen responsibility of setting up A’Saffa Poultry 
			Farms, Oman’s first ever fully integrated poultry project producing 
			broiler chickens. Prior to this, he worked in the department of 
			animal wealth in the then ministry of agriculture and fisheries for 
			a total of almost 19 years and took early retirement to join the 
			private sector.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Staying alive</b><br>
			The turning point of his life came when he suffered two heart 
			attacks and still survived. His joie de vivre is evident in the fact 
			that despite the doctor’s warning him that he may suffer another 
			heart attack, Dr Mauly is undaunted. “I have had two heart attacks 
			and then I had another one. Despite all the bypass surgeries I only 
			have one main vein going to my heart. But I run and I can do 
			everything and I continue to play golf. But if my health permits I 
			still see myself working for the company, it is a big challenge in 
			this company and I am really enjoying it,” Dr Mauly says. His 
			greatest achievement, personally, was getting A’Saffa Poultry off 
			the ground against a lot of challenges at a time when there was a 
			lot of competition from Brazil and other parts of the world.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Sportsmanship</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="board1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Dr Mauly is a sportsman. His main passion being golf. “I like sports 
			in general, including cricket (laughs) but unfortunately I have 
			never played it. The Twenty20 matches – I watch them all the time. 
			But golf is my passion and now I am building up another passion 
			which I had left off when I started golf and that is fishing. I am 
			in the process of buying a small boat as I intend to start going 
			fishing every now and then,” Dr Mauly informs. He also plays tennis 
			and squash. And he is eagerly looking forward to the number of new 
			golf courses coming up in Oman amidst all the new residential and 
			tourist projects.<br>
			<br>
			Though despite his demanding schedule and social pursuits, Dr Mauly 
			is a complete family man so much so that he had to make some 
			sacrifices on the professional front to be close to them. “I love my 
			children (two boys and two girls) and I love spending time with them 
			and my wife. We travel a lot together and recently returned from a 
			holiday in Zanzibar – it was my first time back there since I left 
			35 years ago. It was an amazing experience. So I feel that I balance 
			work and family life fairly well,” he states. </font></p>

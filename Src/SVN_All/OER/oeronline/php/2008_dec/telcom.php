			<b>The awarding of the second fixed line licence to Nawras signals 
			the end of monopoly in the telecom sector, writes Visvas Paul D 
			Karra<br>
			<br>
			</b>Intense competition for the second integrated fixed line 
			telecommunications licence in the Sultanate of Oman which began in 
			the month of March finally cooled off in November following the 
			Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of Oman awarding the 
			licence to Nawras consortium marking the beginning of an exciting 
			and significant phase in the Sultanate’s liberalisation policy of 
			the telecommunications sector.<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="telcom.jpg" width="225" height="481" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>All round impact<br>
			</b>With the licence being granted to Nawras consortium, the 
			monopoly of the state-owned Oman Telecommunications (Omantel) which 
			held sway for more than 20 years will also come to an end. Besides 
			contributing to the advancement of the telecom infrastructure, 
			competition in fixed public telecom services will also support the 
			growth of varied services, particularly in the area of broadband 
			Internet and enhance the quality of services and create new jobs 
			opportunities for Omanis.<br>
			<br>
			In a statement issued on November 18, the TRA said the Integrated 
			Fixed Public Telecommunications Licence in Oman was awarded to Nawras Consortium on condition that it will honour all the 
			obligations specified in the Information Memorandum which comprises 
			of the tender terms and condition relating to the bidding process. 
			In another development, the awarding of the licence to Nawras 
			consortium has jolted the PCCW-Awaser Oman consortium which had 
			originally won the bid for the fixed line services in October and 
			had been given 15 days time to honour its obligation in accordance 
			with the Information Memorandum. When contacted by Oman Economic 
			Review, PCCW, in a terse one line statement said it was disappointed 
			and mystified by the change in decision by TRA.<br>
			<br>
			Meanwhile, Ross Cormack, CEO of Nawras, in his comments to Oman 
			Economic Review said that Nawras is investing millions of dollars 
			over the next few years to provide the latest generation fibre optic 
			backbone and WiMAX wireless access networks across the Sultanate to 
			deliver broadband telecommunications and Internet access and to 
			offer innovative cutting edge IP based media and communication 
			services to consumers, businesses and government. When asked to 
			comment on the way in which Nawras was awarded the fixed line 
			licence after it was first awarded to PCCW-Awaser Oman consortium, 
			Cormack lauded the TRA for its professionalism and said that this 
			only indicates the transparency in the process of granting this 
			fixed line licence.<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="telcom1.jpg" width="150" height="174" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">“Nawras is honoured to have this great opportunity to provide a wide 
			range of innovative services for the people of Oman, which will be 
			carefully designed to meet the requirements of the various market 
			segments,” says Cormack. When asked how different Nawras will be 
			from the incumbent operator, Cormack said Nawras will deliver fixed 
			telecommunications services with its brand values of being caring, 
			excellent and pleasingly different in the same successful way as it 
			has provided mobile services to the Sultanate since 2005. Nawras is 
			planning to employ around 250 people to support the new business, 
			and create an additional 350 jobs in the sales and distribution 
			channels of Nawras and its partners. Nawras plan in the first two 
			years is to roll out its wireless broadband service to five 
			governorates and 14 wilayats by utilising the international 
			experience and expertise of its parent and majority shareholder Q-tel 
			in developing and deploying fixed line and broadband services for 
			the Sultanate.<br>
			<br>
			The licence with the exception of broadband spectrum rights is for a 
			period of 25 years with the ability to renew it on expiry of the 
			original term. Broadband spectrum rights shall be for 15 years with 
			ability to renew for an additional 10 years on expiry of the 
			original term. It is noteworthy that the Sultanate of Oman has a 
			population of around 2.75 million, with fixed-line phone penetration 
			of just 10 per cent and Internet and broadband penetration of only 3 
			per cent.<br>
			<br>
			Meanwhile, Dr Mohammed bin Ali Al Wahaibi, CEO, Omantel, welcomed 
			the decision of TRA to award the second integrated fixed line public 
			telecommunications licence in the Sultanate to Nawras.</font></p>

			</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="telcom2.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Oman Mobile, the Sultanate’s leading mobile operator, is the first 
			mobile operator to launch mobile resellers in the Middle East. Oman 
			Mobile signed agreements with Majan Telecommunications, (Renna) and 
			FRiENDi Mobile become mobile resellers using Oman Mobile’s network 
			infrastructure. OER had reported this in its November issue. The 
			agreements will enable Renna and FRiENDi Mobile to resell mobile 
			services to customers across the whole country using their own brand 
			and their own marketing and sales channels. Under the terms of the 
			agreements, Renna and FRiENDi Mobile will be able to develop and 
			offer their own services and manage all aspects of relations with 
			their customers including customer care, billing and other after 
			sales support.<br>
			<br>
			Dr Amer Al Rawas Oman Mobile’s managing director expressed his 
			happiness over concluding these two agreements making the Sultanate 
			of Oman the first country in the Middle East to introduce mobile 
			resellers. He pointed out “The agreements with Renna and FRiENDi 
			Mobile are a concrete response from Oman Mobile to the decisions and 
			policies set forth by the government and the Telecommunications 
			Regulatory Authority (TRA). We are implementing this in the public 
			interest and for the best returns for the customers and the society. 
			It also resembles a positive response to the evolving consumer needs 
			and market expectations.”<br>
			<br>
			Niklas Nielsen, Renna CEO, said, “This announcement marks a new 
			milestone in the telecommunications industry in Oman. As the only 
			100% Omani owned company among those who have been awarded a mobile 
			reseller license from TRA, we are exceptionally proud to be selected 
			as a Mobile Resellers of Oman Mobile services, the Sultanate’s 
			leading mobile operator.”<br>
			<br>
			Antti Arponen, CEO of FRiENDi mobile Oman said: “We at FRiENDi 
			mobile are proud to be launching this exciting new business model in 
			Oman first and then in other markets in the SAMEA region in the 
			months to come. We are extremely satisfied with the signing of this 
			agreement which allows FRiENDi mobile to launch innovative and 
			exciting mobile services in Oman”.<br>
			<br>
			Renna and FRiENDi Mobile have made arrangements with strong partners 
			to secure marketing and distribution assets which will enable them 
			to handle all the critical aspects of a mobile reseller activity. <br>

pilot trainees</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="bus1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="126">Oman Air has welcomed a group of 19 Omani Commercial Pilot License-holders who 
successfully completed their “ATPL” (Air Transport Pilot License) Bridge Course 
as an integral part of the Airline Professional Pilot Career Development 
Programme. The course was conducted by Ayla Academy in the Kingdom of Jordan.<br>
<br>
Oman Air believes that among the various positions that are brilliantly handled 
by Omani personnel at various levels, the role of a pilot is the one that is 
most in demand at a global level. The 19 pilot trainees undertook an intensive 
training programme and came back with commendable results. This new batch has 
undertaken several tests and training programmes in accordance with the new 
International Civil Aviation Organisation “ICAO” regulations. The next stage for 
them is to undergo technical courses on Oman Air fleets, safety standards, 
simulation, service manual specification and practice. Trainees will be closely 
monitored until completion of the conversion stage. Oman Air develops tomorrow’s 
career pilot through industry-specific-training-experience with emphasis on 
quality and safety. Each pilot is trained to be an effective member with a 
positive attitude, strong work ethics, sound aeronautical decision-making 
skills, and exceptional airmanship.<br>

        <img border="0" src="bus2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="250" height="124">Renaissance Services SAOG has been awarded contracts by Petroleum 
        Development Oman LLC (PDO) to build, own and operate new Permanent 
        Accommodation for Contractors (PAC) facilities in Oman’s interior 
        oilfields at Marmul and Bahja. The long-term contracts run until 2044 
        and the contract value of the initial 5-year period is in excess of 
        RO35mn. Renaissance is investing some RO33mn in establishing the 
        facilities. Once construction and other project contracts are finalised, 
        operations are expected to commence in 2010. The Marmul facility will 
        have 512 rooms and the Bahja facility 304 rooms, with both sites having 
        room for further expansion. The project anticipates an occupancy level 
        of 1,000 residents at Marmul and 600 residents at Bahja. Renaissance 
        already owns and operates ‘PAC’ facilities for PDO contractors at Fahud 
        and Nimr, which opened in August 2000, and Qarn Alam, which opened in 
        February 2002. These three existing PACs have a total of 1,452 rooms and 
        accommodate over 3,000 people. The Renaissance PAC projects won the 
        prestigious Oman Awards for Excellence ‘Investment Project of the Year’ 
        for 2001. Commenting on the important new contract awards, Renaissance 
        Chairman, Samir Fancy says, “Through the PDO PAC initiatives Oman has 
        been at the forefront of raising living conditions and occupational 
        health for workforces. The Renaissance PAC concept and design provides a 
        cost-effective quality solution.”<br>
        <br>
        Renaissance CEO, Stephen Thomas elaborates this point saying, “A 
        Renaissance PAC delivers higher standards at lower costs through 
        economies of scale. The key to the cost-effectiveness of these projects 
        is the predicted likely volume of occupancy and the longevity of the 
        contract period. Residents are safer, healthier and happier in a quality 
        lifestyle environment. The concept can be beneficial to any large 
        constituency of people, including resident workforces, students and 
        military.” The PAC facilities include accommodation with en-suite 
        bathrooms. Recreation facilities including swimming pool, gymnasium, 
        squash, tennis, volleyball, basketball courts and other indoor and 
        outdoor sports and games facilities. There is a fully equipped clinic. 
        Dining facilities are supported by state-of-the-art kitchens, bakery and

        A new full-fledged advertising agency, focusing primarily on the Omani 
        market, called Blacksheep-Mazoon was launched in Oman. The company is a 
        tie up between the Bahrain-based Blacksheep Advertising and Oman’s W J 
        Towell Group. Jamil Sultan is the chairman of Blacksheep-Mazoon 
        Advertising and Moosa Al Aaali, the Managing and Creative Director of 
        the Bahrain-based Blacksheep Advertising, is the CEO and Executive 
        Creative Director of Blacksheep-Mazoon. Aaali asserted that Oman 
        advertising market lacked international level creativity and their 
        company would deliver what was missing here.<br>

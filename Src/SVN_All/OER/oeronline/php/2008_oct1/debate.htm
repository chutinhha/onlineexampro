                  hour. With 90 per cent localisation, banks need the best 
                  quality staff to serve the client well and be viable. One of 
                  the reasons, the best of the local staff opt for government 
                  jobs is because of the holidays, weekends, working hours etc. 
                  Talent acquisition and talent retention is basic to a bank’s 
                  viability. The banks’ offer in terms of working conditions has 
                  to be comparable to the options existing in the market. 
                  Efficient bank staff is a key to good service to customers

                  <font face="Verdana" size="1">Five day week is a good move 
                  specially keeping Thursday as a full day. This way banks get 
                  four days for international banking instead of the earlier 
                  three and a half days. Saturday is either a half day or full 
                  day off internationally so the weekend is aligned with the 
                  international practice. From the benefit point of view, 
                  five-day working is better than five and a half day as its 
                  results in savings on running cost of offices and staff gets 
                  required rest and time to spend with family which results in

                  banking, ATM, credit card options the visit to a bank by 
                  customers is not warranted at all. Banks should achieve higher 
                  penetration in such service usage to accustom customers. For 
                  example, instead of charging extra for using an ATM they 
                  should reward clients for using automated services like ATM 
                  etc. So long as automated services are functional it really 
                  does not matter. Look at INGDirect bank, no one ever gets to

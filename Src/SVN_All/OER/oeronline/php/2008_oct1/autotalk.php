        It seems that Nissan has been listening to its customers and decided to 
        make sure that the new Armada wins hearts. writes Malcolm Xavier CRASTA<br>
        </b><br>
        <img border="0" src="auto.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="289">The Armada was originally created for the American market, trying to 
        capitalise on America’s love for big SUVs and for the most part it 
        succeeded. It had what was needed to make it big (no pun intended); a 
        generous and spacious cabin, large towing capacity and a powerful V8 
        under the hood. But unfortunately it was less than perfect and did come 
        with its share of flaws one of which was the bland and hard plasticky 
        interior. But it seems that Nissan has been listening to us and it has 
        corrected this for the better. While the cabin still retains some of the 
        hard plastics of the previous model, for the most part, it is a huge 
        improvement. It now features a new dash with an integrated 7-inch 
        display which is used as a vehicle information centre of sorts, while in 
        the two higher end models, it also doubles as a DVD based Navigation 
        system. The interior also features a lot of soft-touch materials and 
        wood accents, making for a much more welcoming cabin. One look at the 
        Armada and any concerns of the interior space will dissolve like coffee 
        in hot water. <br>
        <br>
        There are three rows for seating. The first two rows beat almost all of 
        its competitors for space and only the Ford expedition has more room in 
        the third row thanks to its lower floor. To add to the feeling of space, 
        Nissan has included a ton of storage cubbies all over the place even 
        overhead to make life a little bit easier. Unfortunately though, in 
        giving so much attention to passenger space it loses out a bit in the 
        luggage department. With both the rear rows folded down (third row is 
        power folding in the two higher-end models) it offers a total of 97 
        cubic feet of space. While this may seem more than adequate for those 
        weekend trips and monthly shopping, which it definitely is, it is still 
        10 cubic feet short of the class average.<br>
        <br>
        There are three trim levels in total available but regardless of what 
        you buy almost all of the features are available even on the base model. 
        The 7-inch display, Bose sound system, intelligent key, rear view 
        monitor, power driver and passenger seats are all standard. The only 
        major upgrades in the options is the addition of a bluetooth handsfree 
        kit, navigation system and power folding third row seating on the 
        mid-range model and, in addition to this, a rear DVD entertainment 
        system and a sunroof on the high-end model. On the safety front, all 
        models come with ABS, TPMS, stability control and all-round airbags are 
        standard throughout the range. The only thing we were wondering is why 
        Xenon headlamps were not included in such a high end vehicle either as 
        standard or an option?<br>
        <br>
        The Armada is big, brutish, heavy and extremely powerful and this is 
        exactly how it behaves on the road. Powered by a 5.6l V8, producing a 
        gross 360hp and 385Nm of torque, the Armada shoots of the line as if its 
        weight was for nothing. But as soon as you reach a corner or during an 
        emergency stop this weight becomes very obvious. The soft suspensions 
        don’t really help the matter here but on the other hand these same 
        suspensions are the reason the Armada has such a smooth and comfortable 
        ride. It soaks up bumps and ditches quite easily. While we didn’t test 
        the vehicle off-road we will be hard-pressed to believe it won’t excel 
        there as well, with its good ground clearance and prodigious power. <br>
        <br>
        Anyone in the market for a really big SUV with tons of space should 
        really consider the Armada. But you have to keep in mind that you will 
        be getting exactly what you see. The Armada has tons of power on tap but 
        suffers a bit through corners because of its girth and soft suspensions. 
        But overall it is a great vehicle if you exploit its strengths! </font></p>

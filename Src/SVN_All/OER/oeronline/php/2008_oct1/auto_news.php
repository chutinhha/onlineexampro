REDEFINING THE FAMILY SEDAN</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="auto2.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="200" height="131">The Ford Five Hundred is a large family sedan that offers abundance of space, 
class-leading features and smooth revving power. Its rear-seat room is 
particularly impressive. In fact, there’s more rear legroom (41.9 inches) than 
front legroom (41.2 inches). All seats feature what Ford calls a command view of 
the road, with seat-bottom cushions that are some four inches higher than those 
of a typical mid-sized sedan. With plenty of glass all around, outward 
visibility is excellent. The Five Hundred comes with a body structure that 
benefits from the latest in safety technology. The front seats are mounted on a 
cross-body beam that runs from the bottom of the B-pillar (the post between the 
front and rear doors) that adds strength to the car’s shell and helps provide 
protection in the event of a side impact. Powered by a 3.5 litre 286 horsepower 
V6 engine, the Ford Five Hundred accelerates with authority. In Oman, Ford 
vehicles are brought to you by Arabian Car Marketing Co, a part of the Saud 
Bahwan Group. <br>

SLS <br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Elegance, comfort, and superior 
driving performance are the three keynotes of the All –new Cadillac SLS. 
Externally, the SLS is unmistakably Cadillac in styling. The diamond-faceted 
contours echo the geometry of its CTS and STS stablemates, mirroring the brand’s 
rich heritage of art in design, and subtle V-shapes, inspired by Cadillac’s 
shield badge, are a recurring motif in exterior and interior design execution. 
The chrome pentagonal grille is a variant on the classic badge shape and points 
to the future of Cadillac’s exterior design language, with cues inspired by the 
Cadillac Sixteen concept car. The SLS offers a good interior design, fittings, 
and finishes, delivering a comfortable experience from any seat. The tone is set 
by luxurious ambient lighting that bathes the cabin in tranquil and elegant 
‘Cadillac White,’ an automotive innovation modelled on first-class air travel.<br>

SEAT’s new saloon car will be called ‘EXEO’. Its market launch, scheduled for

expanding its model range in all new segments. The SEAT EXEO is an elegant, 
dynamic saloon with high quality and outstanding technology that faithfully 
reflects SEAT’s personality – design, sportiness and liveliness. “Faithful to 
SEAT’s Mediterranean roots, the new name stems from the Latin word ‘Exire’, 
meaning ‘to go beyond’, ‘to go further’. The name differs from all the other 
range denominations, and indicates the beginning of a new period for the 
company, that takes the brand to an all new segment,” says Annurag Chawla, Head

PRESSURE MONITORING TECHNOLOGY </font></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<br>
Four little wheel sensors can help save lives by alerting motorists to low tyre 
pressure, a potentially dangerous driving situation. General Motors is a leader 
in installing Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) and has installed it in 
four million vehicles. The GM TPMS, available as standard on all Hummer models, 
utilises separate sensors mounted in each wheel. These sensors use real-time 
monitoring to determine the pressure in each tyre. A warning light on the 
instrument panel or a message displayed on the driver information centre along 
with an audible warning, alerts to check the air pressures in the tyre. </font>

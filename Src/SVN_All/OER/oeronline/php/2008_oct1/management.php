<b>Recruiting and retaining talent have always been a struggle for global 
companies. Today, the challenges are larger than ever. With demand rising and 
supply dwindling, companies are finding that the talent issue, especially in 
rapidly developing economies (RDEs), is one of their most critical challenges. 
By Daniel Friedman, Jim Hemerling and Jacqueline Chapman</b><br>
<br>
Three factors make the global marketplace for talent far more competitive than 
ever before. First, the rise of RDEs and the globalisation of value chains have 
sharply ratcheted up demand. Companies are seeking the best locations for their 
operations, making decisions on the basis of cost, talent and proximity to 
markets. One global company projects the need to hire 20,000 employees in Asia 
over the next decade, which will strain its well-developed overseas 
human-resources (HR) engine.<br>
<br>
Second, big demographic shifts in the West are dramatically tightening supply. 
Few companies have adequately prepared for the talent shortages that will be 
created by the retirement of the baby boomers. In the US, 75 mn people are 
approaching retirement, and only 30 mn members of Generation X are available as 
successors. In the European Union, the working-age population is forecast to 
fall by 48 mn, or 16 per cent, by 2050.<br>
<br>
Third, skilled workers are at a particular premium. Although RDEs have a 
bountiful supply of workers to take up the slack in unskilled jobs, they fall 
short when it comes to educated and skilled positions. Candidates for those jobs 
are increasingly difficult to find and keep because their relatively small 
numbers make the competition for them so intense.<br>
<br>
<b>Managing talent</b><br>
Talent management needs to become a core activity on a par with corporate 
finance and strategic planning. Talent must be managed rigorously and globally – 
across languages, cultures and time zones. Companies should be making plans that 
look out at least three to five years. At the same time, the systems and 
processes involved in managing talent must be sufficiently flexible to permit 
customisation to local conditions and markets. Based on our experience with 
global companies and interviews or surveys of close to 100 executives, we 
identify five key actions for success.<br>
<br>
<b>Create a new global model</b>. Global companies need to reorient their organisations, 
operations and processes to reflect the new order of talent management, as Cisco 
Systems is doing by committing itself to basing 20 per cent of its executives in 
India by 2010. Recruiting, leadership development and training need to be 
organised in a way that allows talent to develop in RDEs and other distant 
markets. As companies distribute their operations globally, they will also need 
to figure out how to assign decision rights and reorient decision-making 
processes to reflect the new order. As people – and power – move away from a 
single centre, companies must revisit fundamental organisation-design principles 
regarding the role of the centre, the sizing and staffing of functions, and the 
coordination of activities across the enterprise.<br>
<br>
<b>Elevate global talent planning to an item on the CEO’s agenda</b>. Working in 
concert with HR, the CEO and other top executives should routinely address 
talent issues. The CEO of a 110,000-employee industrial-goods company, for 
example, recently became concerned that the company’s talent pipeline was too 
small to support its anticipated growth in RDEs and its entry into service 
businesses. Subsequent analysis revealed that the company would have to increase 
by a factor of eight the number of executives hired in Brazil, Russia, India and 
China. Because senior managers recognised the importance of these hires to the 
company’s success, they put their full weight behind a comprehensive 
talent-management programme and an HR brand-awareness campaign in those markets.<br>
<br>
<b>Knowledge age</b><br>
<b>Expand the hiring horizon</b>. Many global companies rely largely on poaching talent 
from competitors when they enter new markets. But to meet future needs, they 
will have to start cultivating talent themselves. Among other things, they 
should be hiring ready-to-use graduates from top schools in local markets. They 
need to focus on hiring and training talented but untested recruits as well. 
Companies also should develop strong ties to less renowned schools to gain 
access to their best students.<br>
<br>
<b>Accelerate careers and create global leaders</b>. To capture rapid growth in RDEs, 
global companies need to build high-performing management and leadership teams 
in a fraction of the time it takes to put them together in developed economies. 
To construct these local teams, companies must deploy a new 
leadership-development model and demonstrate that they offer meaningful 
leadership positions and promotion opportunities to recruits from RDEs. Money 
alone is often insufficient to keep the best employees, but a combination of 
compensation, career opportunities and a good working environment can go a long 
way toward retaining the best and brightest.<br>
<br>
International rotations are a key part of career and leadership development 
programs, offering high-potential candidates in RDEs the chance to be exposed to 
cultures and business practices in other parts of the world. Rotations also help 
feed the global talent pipeline.<br>
<br>
<b>Ensure that all leaders embrace the new global mindset</b>. If companies are to grow 
quickly in local markets, they need strong local leaders with an entrepreneurial 
bent and a belief in the global values of the organisation. This commitment 
needs to start at the top. At Air Liquide, an industrial goods company with 
headquarters in France, two of the top five performance indicators for the local 
leadership team in China pertain to talent.<br>
<br>
Every year, the senior leaders in China develop talent strategies and project 
talent needs for coming years. In 2007, they had already developed a plan for 
2015. The company is investing heavily in talent today in order to be prepared 
for tomorrow.<br>
<br>
For too long, companies have treated talent and strategy as separate spheres. 
Top executives have taken care of strategy and delegated talent to HR or to 
junior staff. That approach no longer works. Talent and strategy need to fit 
together like a hand in a glove, requiring senior executives to work closely 
with their HR staffs and local business-unit executives. Achieving a global 
talent advantage is hard, which explains why few companies do it successfully. 
But it is not an optional exercise. </font>

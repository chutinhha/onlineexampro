            Ho! How to motivate people in any organisation</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
            <br>
            <b>By Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles</b><br>
            Harper Collins <br>
            Pp 187<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Ken Blanchard and 
            Sheldon Bowles, in their inimitable style, have packaged a few 
            powerful concepts on Human Resource Development in this 180-odd 
            pages book. The readers may get a feeling of great relief after 
            being treated with grandma's home-grown herbal medicine from the 
            backyard for a chronic illness, in lieu of a complicated surgery!! 
            The book is a treatise for the modern busy executive who needs to 
            spare only a few hours (Ken Blanchard has sure graduated to hours) 
            to read this book to be awoken to some amazing facts on motivating 
            and getting the best out of people... rather, by the people 
            themselves! <br>
            <br>
            The book takes one through the woods and draws inspiration from 
            Mother Nature's own message through chirpy squirrels, busy beavers 
            and cheering geese. The narration, as could be expected from the 
            authors, is uncomplicated and has an uncanny ability to keep the 
            readers hooked on. <br>
            <br>
            Gung Ho is replete with the entire gamut of leading people through 
            shared goals, values, mutual appreciation and training, and 
            pulverises the bossy boss myth. The authors at 
            <img border="0" src="gm.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="100" height="128">times try to capture 
            the reader in an emotional web, and one is left to ponder for a few 
            quiet moments on the central character who managed to turn around a 
            sick unit to an award winner. When I drove to office after the 
            weekend, I was keenly watching the street cats for a clue on 
            managing people since the squirrels, beavers and geese were sadly 
            not to be found in this part of the world. Jokes apart, this book is 
            worth every baiza, and a must-read for managers. <br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">I read five 
            newspapers every day, even on Fridays. I also check news on the web, 
            be it political, economical or social. Also, since I finished my 
            bachelor's degree (some five years back) I never spent time reading 
            a book. However, this book is different because it talks about 
            stupid moments in some of the best organisations in the world. <br>
            <br>
            The book falls into 150 pages and covers the dumbest moments in five 
            major departments that most of the organisations have these days, 
            namely: R&amp;D, Human Resources, Marketing, Accounting...etc. However, 
            I have selected one of the dumbest decisions I have gone over 
            through my readings. <br>
            <br>
            This moment is about the Grant department in the 1970s and it is 
            about a simple incentive scheme which quotes: Òhit your target and 
            we won't humiliate you.Ó In the 1970s Grant was hunting for new 
            revenue streams. Grant launched a massive push to sign up customers 
            for Grant credit cards and they knew that its managers were the key 
            to success. Thus, the managers who don't meet their targets were 
            subjected to punishments that included being forced to use their 
            noses to push peanuts across a floor, getting slapped in the face 
            with pies and being forced to wear diapers. <br>
            <br>
            The punishment worked so well that credit card purchasers leaped to 
            a quarter of the company's sales. But then, in 1974, the retail 
            company had to write off $ 94 million in 
            <img border="0" src="im14.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="128" hspace="5">losses from customers who 
            wouldn't pay their charges. A year later the company declared 
            bankruptcy. By early 1976, Grant and its 980 stores were no more.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is only one dump moment, imagine going over the remaining 100!

Since Oman’s pullout from Gulf Air over a month ago and as part of its expansion 
strategies, Oman Air has recently added four new destinations including Abu 
Dhabi in UAE, Chittagong in Bangladesh and Lucknow and Jaipur in India. The 
airline has added two more new aircrafts to its fleet. Oman Air has also 
designated a group of young school leavers to undergo full Joint Aviation 
Authority Airline Transport Pilots license at Atlantic Flight Training Ltd. in 
UK. Captain Hamed Al Jabry, Senior Manager-Line Operations, Oman Air said: “As 
the Omani cadet pilots are getting ready to take the skies, Oman Air looked for 
a partner who can provide us with quality and well trained Boeing 737 pilots. 
Spicejet, a leading airline in India, has been finalised by Oman Air for 
partnership. We entered into a strategic tie-up with Spicejet after an extensive 
and careful inspection. Their pilots will fly with Oman Air on a contract basis 
for a period of one year.”<br>

</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has announced that it received shareholder 
approval to go ahead with the full development of the Mabrouk field. The new 
field development plan, which was discovered in 1979 and is currently producing 
around 8,000 barrels a day, calls for the drilling of up to 80 new wells and the 
construction of a new production station and gathering system. The project is 
being fast-tracked so that the additional incremental production is expected on 
stream in late 2009. When all the new hardware has been fully commissioned, the 
field is expected to produce around 15,000-20,000 barrels a day of oil and 1-2 
million cubic metres a day of gas. The gas will be delivered to the Saih Rawl 
gas processing plant where it will enter the Government Gas System. According to 
PDO, just 1 per cent of the oil-in-place at Mabrouk has been produced so far and 
the full-field development plan will increase the recovery factor to
around 10-12 per cent.<br>

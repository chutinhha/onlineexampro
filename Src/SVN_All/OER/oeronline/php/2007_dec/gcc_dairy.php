        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">According to the 2007 Country Brand Index (CBI), the UAE is one of the 
        world’s top two shopping havens, and is among the top three countries 
        with the highest potential to become a major tourist destination in the 
        next five years.<br>
        <br>
        Country Brand Index, now in its third year, is a comprehensive study of 
        more than 2,600 international travellers, conducted by FutureBrand, a 
        leading global brand consultancy, in conjunction with public relations 
        firm Weber Shandwick’s Global Travel &amp; Lifestyle Practice. The Index 
        examines how countries are branded and ranked according to key criteria, 
        with this year’s index also including trends on travel motivations as 
        well as challenges and opportunities within the divisions of travel, 
        tourism and country branding.<br>
        <br>
        “A strong country brand provides an opportunity for a country to 
        showcase its values across every government sector,” said Rina Plapler, 
        Executive Director, FutureBrand. “In this year’s Country Brand Index, we 
        describe how multifaceted countries act as brands and how they require 
        specific frameworks, typologies and the use of considered semiotics.”<br>
        <br>
        The UAE won the Best Country Brand for the ‘Resort/Lodgings Options 
        category, thus being recognised for its unrivalled reputation as the 
        world’s leading resort and lodging destination. Mega projects such as 
        the Palms and other distinct resort developments propelled the country 
        to the highest position on the scale, narrowly beating the Maldives and 
        Australia.<br>
        <br>
        The UAE was also placed second in the Best Country Brand in the Shopping 
        category, just behind the US, but ahead of countries like Singapore, 
        Italy and Japan. The UAE’s huge investments to build up its MICE 
        (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events) facilities have also paid 
        off, with the country coming in the top five in the Best Country Brand 
        for Conferences category.<br>
        <br>
        The UAE was also recognised for its trend-setting initiatives in travel 
        and tourism, which aim to extend brand experience in everyday life. For 
        instance, world-renowned fashion labels such as Armani and Versace were 
        the first to infuse their signature aesthetics among hotels in Dubai.<br>
        <br>
        “A country’s brand reputation is in itself a powerful currency. 
        Reputation drives financial and business investment, sustainable growth 
        and helps add fuel to the private and retail sectors,” said René A Mack, 
        President, Weber Shandwick’s Travel &amp; Lifestyle Global Practice.<br>
        “A visitor is the most powerful marketer for any country brand. They 
        import the destination and its products and experiences directly into 
        their homes, offices and social communities, combined with the most 
        powerful voice of all – word of mouth.”<br>
        <br>
        The UAE is the only GCC state cited in the Country Brand Index and one 
        of only two Middle East countries that have figured prominently on the 
        Index. Egypt also made its mark by topping the Best Country Brand for 
        History, and joining Italy and France among the top three in the Best 
        Country Brand for Art and Culture. Australia was once again the world’s 
        top country brand, according to the Country Brand Index, with the US 
        second and the UK ascending to the third place. Other countries making 
        the list included Japan, Canada, France and Greece. Aside from the UAE, 
        the Country Brand Index also identified Croatia, China, Cuba, Iceland 
        and the Russian Federation as potential major tourist destinations in 
        the next five years.<br>

        <b>Why wealthy Gulf states are not rated Aaa</b><br>
        The six-member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council – Bahrain, Kuwait, 
        Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE – have enjoyed an unprecedented 
        economic boom over the past five years. Reflecting their enhanced 
        creditworthiness and ability to cope with potential shocks, they have 
        received sovereign ratings upgrades from Moody’s Investors Service of 
        between two and four notches since 2003.<br>
        <br>
        Such has been the degree of their economic improvement that some GCC 
        countries now outperform even Aaa-rated countries, according to several 
        of Moody’s comparative ratios. Yet even the wealthiest Gulf states 
        (Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE) do not currently have ratings higher than 
        Aa2, Moody’s says in a new Special Comment. In essence, this is for 
        three key reasons: regional geopolitical vulnerabilities, the developing 
        state of domestic institutions, and the volatility of economic 
        performance associated with a heavy concentration on hydrocarbons.<br>
        <br>
        “Measured in output per capita, the prosperity of the six GCC countries 
        has climbed sharply in recent years, in some cases to very high levels, 
        on the back of soaring global oil prices and impressive progress in 
        economic diversification. Perhaps, most importantly from a sovereign 
        ratings perspective, there has been a dramatic strengthening of 
        governments’ balance sheets over this period as fiscal and current 
        account surpluses have widened. This is despite a strong pickup in 
        government expenditure and imports,” says Tristan Cooper, Moody’s 
        Vice-President / Senior Analyst and author of the report.<br>
        <br>
        “The considerable enhancement to governments’ creditworthiness has been 
        well reflected in Moody’s sovereign ratings, which now range from A2 for 
        Bahrain and Oman, to A1 for Saudi Arabia, and Aa2 for Kuwait, Qatar and 
        the UAE. These are high investment grade ratings and denote a very low 
        risk of default,” Cooper notes. “However, even though some GCC states 
        now outperform even Aaa-rated countries on some economic indicators, 
        even the wealthiest among them are not rated Aaa. This is for several 
        reasons. Firstly, Aaa-rated countries tend to be located in regions with 
        a long track record of political stability, whereas the Middle East – 
        and particularly the Gulf region – has a more troubled political 
        history,” Cooper explains. <br>
        <br>
        “Secondly, institutions in the GCC continue to be of a more developing 
        nature than those in Aaa-rated countries. The evaluation of 
        institutional strength encapsulates the quality of governance, including 
        the effectiveness of countries’ administrative, legislative and judicial 
        apparatus. Such factors are important for determining sovereign ratings 
        because they are an indication of the likely stability and consistency 
        of the domestic policy environment over the longer term. GCC states also 
        face some challenges in regard to the quality and scope of economic 
        data, which hinders effective monitoring,” Cooper adds.<br>
        <br>
        “Finally, GCC countries’ economic performance has exhibited marked 
        fluctuations, far more pronounced than those of Aaa-rated countries, in 
        light of the still heavy concentration of their economies on oil and gas 
        despite material progress towards diversification. This trait is 
        pertinent to the assessment of sovereign risk because, globally, 
        countries displaying higher levels of economic volatility have tended to 
        be more prone to shocks and therefore to have a greater risk of default. 
        However, Moody’s of course notes the stabilising role of growing 
        sovereign wealth funds in the region.”</font></p>

        </font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stock market to double by 2010</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
        Saudi Arabia, the most active initial public offering (IPO) market and 
        largest stock market by capitalisation in the Middle East, is set to 
        double over the next two years, according to Brad Bourland, Chief 
        Economist at Jadwa Investment. Bourland made the remarks during the 2nd 
        Saudi IPO Summit at Riyadh. “Currently, there are 100 companies listed 
        on the Tasi and I would expect that number to double within the coming 
        two years. Being held in Saudi Arabia, this IPO Summit is creating a 
        healthy environment for IPO partners and bankers to do business together 
        for the benefit of the stock market and the wider Saudi economy.” 
        Increasingly Saudi Arabian companies are using IPOs as a vehicle for 
        raising capital. This is now attracting not only local but international 
        investors, with overseas capital being drawn into the local market 
        supplementing the existing high levels of liquidity. With oil now 
        touching US$ 96 per barrel, investors still have a healthy appetite for 
        IPOs. Strong GDP growth will drive the market and provide the stamina 
        for numerous public offerings in the months ahead.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><img border="0" src="gcc4.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>

        after Dubai. The local authorities have approved initial plans for a 
        colossal new development that includes a tower expected to be over one 
        kilometre high. Kuwait’s Municipal Council has also approved sketches of 
        the 250 sq km development, known as the Madinat Al-Hareer, which will be 
        built opposite the capital city across Kuwait Bay.<br>
        <br>
        The Madinat Al-Hareer, or City of Silk, is expected to take around 25

        indication yet as to when construction will begin. The project includes 
        construction of a 200-hectare natural desert reservation, a new airport, 
        a large business centre as well as areas that concentrate on 
        environment, sports, media, health, education, and industry. At its

        Industry research from GulfMerger, an independent financial advisory 
        firm, forecasts continued strong growth in Kuwait’s consumer finance 
        market over the next five years.<br>
        <br>
        The research also reveals that Kuwait’s consumer finance companies are 
        poised to go through a wave of local consolidation and regionalisation, 
        driven by industry players and private equity houses with clear 
        strategic and financial imperatives. The Kuwaiti consumer finance market 
        has grown rapidly in recent years, with consumer loan portfolios growing 
        from KD3.9 billion in 2005 to KD4.6 billion in 2006. According to 
        GulfMerger, car financing has been a key contributor, accounting for 
        KD340 million in new loans in 2006, and an estimated KD390 million in 
        new loans in 2007. Based on current demographic and macroeconomic 
        trends, GulfMerger expects car financing in Kuwait to grow from an 
        annual financing of 65,000 cars in 2007 to over 90,000 cars by 2012, 
        resulting in KD670 million in new car financing loans in 2012. These 
        forecasts are based on the combined effect of three factors: increasing 
        population growth, higher car ownership, and an increasing propensity by 
        car buyers to finance their purchases. Taking each factor in turn, 
        GulfMerger expects Kuwait’s population to grow from 3.4 million to 
        approximately 4.4 million inhabitants over the five year period ending 
        2012, car ownership to expand from 315 to 340 cars per 1,000 
        inhabitants, and car financing to increase from 65 per cent to 
        approximately 70 per cent of all new cars purchased in light of the 
        greater availability of finance providers.<br>

        Baker said: “We are proud to join the growing list of Boeing 787 
        customers. With deliveries from mid-2010 through to 2014, the 787 will 
        form the core of Qatar Airways regional and medium-haul fleet from the

        as it builds its hub at Doha’s new international airport.”<br>
        <br>
        Al Baker said the decision to opt for Boeing 787 was taken following a 
        detailed analysis of the airline’s future aircraft needs over a period 
        of three years, including significant inputs to the 787s original 
        definition and specification. The Boeing 787 order is for the 787-8 
        version with options to convert to the 787-9 variant. Qatar Airways also 
        has confirmed orders for 14 777-300ERs, 6 777-200LRs and 7 777-200Fs, 
        with deliveries beginning in November and running until mid-2010. The 
        two passenger 777 variants will facilitate a major expansion in the 
        airline’s long haul passenger network. The 777-200 freighters, which 
        will be delivered from 2009, provide outstanding economics enabling 
        Qatar Airways to build up an efficient cargo hub linking Europe and 
        Asia, supplemented by its regional widebody freighters and belly

        <img border="0" src="gcc10.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Bahrain’s Information Minister Dr Mohammed bin Abdulghaffar has said 
        that his ministry was currently studying 35 proposals from Bahraini and 
        foreign investors to set up four- and five- star hotels which should 
        give a big boost to plans for a ‘clean tourism’ in the Kingdom. In an 
        interview with the London-based Arabic daily Asharq Al Awsat, the 
        Bahraini minister said that the era of substandard tourism was over in 
        the Kingdom, where night clubs had operated for years without any 
        supervision.<br>
        <br>
        According to him, the new strategy to offer clean tourism was meant to 
        transform Bahrain into a place for family tourism. The goal was to 
        reorganise and diversify facilities to create a high standard of tourism 
        environment for residents and visitors.<br>
        <br>
        In this context, Dr Abdulghaffar said the Kingdom organises a spring 
        festival every year showcasing the diversity of cultures and stages 
        events of international standards. The minister added that the decision 
        to reorganise tourism in the Kingdom should not drive away investors, 
        adding that the Kingdom would not compromise on values just for the sake 
        of attracting investment. Asked whether these decisions were being 
        guided by religious groups, Dr Abdulghaffar said the aim was to develop 
        clean tourism. He also stressed that nightclubs at four- and five-star 
        hotels offered high-quality shows without any violation of guidelines.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this regard, he said the government would not renew night clubs 
        licences in one- and two-star hotels, about 65 in all, since they 
        depended entirely on their clubs and brought a “bad reputation” to the 
        Bahraini tourism sector. He said that disputes on this issue were the 
        result of differences among various interested factions but the 
        government policy of cleaning the tourism sector was final.<br>

        <b>Family bank inspired from Bangladeshi Grameen Bank</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
        A BD5 million Grameen-inspired family bank, targeted at helping 
        low-income households, will be established in Bahrain. According to 
        Social Development Minister Dr Fatima Al Balooshi, the necessary 
        procedures were being finalised with Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB). A 
        constituent ministerial committee had been set up to comply with CBB 
        procedures for the licence to be issue in due time.<br>
        <br>
        The bank, which will have an initial paid up capital of BD5 million, is 
        the brainchild of the Social Development Ministry. The scheme was 
        designed in cooperation with the Bangladeshi Grameen Bank. It will 
        provide low-income families and youth with micro-financing services in a 
        bid to improve their standard of living. The projected bank will draw up 
        mechanisms to cooperate with charity funds and NGOs supporting needy 
        families.</font></p>

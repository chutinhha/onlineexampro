</b>Nine out of ten strategies fail to be implemented successfully. This is the 
outstanding truth that business leaders around the world have been ignoring. For 
40 years since change management first became a business topic, we have been 
blindly following the same recipe for failure! It is an outstanding truth 
because it creates a tremendous opportunity for the one in 10 companies that 
gets it right. It is a blue ocean strategy. A differentiator that can reap 
rewards as the payoff is tremendous when successful, but it requires a shift in 
the way leaders approach strategy and in their fundamental beliefs.<br>
<br>
A large part of the problem is that leaders are habitually underestimating the 
challenge of strategy implementation. After doing the hard work of crafting the 
right strategy, they feel that the toughest part is over and they have done 
their job. Many delegate the implementation and take their eye of what needs to 
be done. After all, let’s be honest, being invited by your CEO to help create 
the company’s future is perceived to be flattering, an opportunity to prove 
oneself, which could lead to promotion. However, being invited by your CEO to 
help implement the strategy is often perceived as laborious and even a 
punishment. Consider though it is not strategy that creates revenue but the 
implementation.<br>
<br>
It is time to change our thinking about strategy. Even the most remarkable 
strategy is not worth the paper it is written on, if it is not implemented 
successfully.<br>
<br>
It is time to change our thinking about implementation. Successful 
implementation, though not rocket science, does take discipline and structure. 
It is about doing many right things at the same time.<br>
<br>
It is time to change our thinking about change. Many organisations end up back 
to business as usual within 12 months of launching a new strategy!<br>
<br>
In recent years, implementation has started to become a recognised field in its 
own right. Articles are starting to appear in leading business journals and 
magazines. There have been several books written on the subject and most 
importantly, leaders are now recognising the need to focus their energies not 
just on crafting strategy but on implementing it.<br>
<br>
Every successful implementation is unique. There are, however, four common 
lessons to be learned.<br>
<br>
<b>Key Lessons</b></font><ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Leaders need to change their thinking. Implementation will probably be 
tougher than you expect. Underestimating the challenge, as most do, is both 
costly and damaging to business. The hard work done by leaders in crafting the 
strategy is lost and failed implementation can lead to declining sales and 
market share. Implementation, however, requires greater leadership focus. In a 
recent Harris poll, 66 per cent of CEOs interviewed from a set of US companies 
said, “skill at the execution level had to be improved”. Reflect in the past how 
much time you have allocated to crafting strategy to how much time you spent on 
its specific implementation, (this does not include daily operational issues).</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Many implementations involve leaders returning to their offices after creating 
their strategy and being left to their own devices to work out next steps. They 
are required to figure out how to inform the people in their division of the 
imminent changes; explain what needs to change and why; review the way the team 
is working; ensure that the current rewards and recognition systems support the 
new strategy; motivate their people and not only assess the current measures 
being used but also report back to their peers. It is a multitude of activities 
that creates a maze that many leaders get lost in. If they do not have a clear 
way of thinking, they typically delegate the responsibility to either internal 
or external consultants. They need to be, however, cognisant that it is their 
responsibility. What is missing is a framework that helps them achieve their 
articulated objectives.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">As you implement strategy, you move from theory to practice, from planning to 
action and from concept to execution. The critical question is, “What are the 
actions you need to take?” A simplistic question in nature but in practice the 
driver of successful implementation because successful implementation is all 
about identifying the right actions to take and then ensuring they are done and 
create the right results. Fortune magazine claims the best practice among the 
best CEOs is that they follow up. At the start of every meeting, they check the 
actions taken from the previous meeting and that the right outcomes were 
achieved.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Implementation never goes according to plan. This is because there are too many 
factors that influence it. Customer expectations change, as do markets and the 
competition. Internally, there will always be staff turnover, operational issues 
and new challenges to overcome. It is therefore critical that you closely 
monitor the implementation and address unanticipated problems as they arise. 
Implementation without proper reviews is like a man falling from a 30-storey 
building. At each floor, someone asks him how he is doing and he replies, “So 
far, looking good|!”</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Implementation is a business differentiator. It is the difference between 
success and failure and can no longer be ignored. If nine out of 10 companies 
fail to implement strategy, then by correcting your implementation you create 
outstanding results.<br><br>Infoline, the leading IT and ITES (IT Enabled Service) provider, brings Robin

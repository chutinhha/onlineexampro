<b>With the onslaught of the CVTs in B and C-Segments, we wondered how the 
Altima would stand up to the competition in its segment</b></font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<br>
The new Altima is quite stylish, specially for a car in its segment. The body 
has subtle changes all of which are quite pleasing. It has enough Nissan design 
cues – even a hint of a 350Z. The rear boot lid is distinctively lower, yet the 
trunk space has grown. Like some cars, particularly the Lexus GS, its fenders 
are sharper and extend farther, allowing the body itself to be narrower. Overall 
aerodynamics is improved from 0.33 to 0.31.<br>
<br>
The wheelbase has been shortened by nearly an inch, and the overall length cut 
by 2.5 inches, with shorter overhangs. The front windshield was moved forward 
and the backlight rearward, preventing any decrease in cabin space. The beltline 
is low so there is more side glass, which adds to the roomy feeling. The 
headlights appear interesting, certainly sophisticated. Nissan says the 
taillights cost nearly as much as the headlamps.<br>
<br>
<b>Interior</b><br>
In redesigning the Altima, Nissan engineers were assigned to create more cabin 
space, and given one inch less wheelbase to work with. They met their goal by 
stretching the distance between A-pillar and C-pillar, thus shortening the 
dashboard and rear deck. There is 1.7 inches less legroom in front, but 3.1 
inches more in the rear, and that’s a lot. However, 0.8 inches of rear headroom 
has been lost. Trunk space has grown from 420 litres to 476 litres.<br>
<br>
The seats are relatively large. They feel firm, longer and higher than in 
previous models. They also have power lumbar support and elevate. We’ve driven 
the old Altima and this one has obviously improved. More soft materials are 
used, for touches like padded armrests, and the overall level of refinement is 
higher. There’s a new four-spoke steering wheel too. The gauges are new, called 
‘fine vision gauges’. Forgive the uncreative name, but they are in the common 
and practical tripod design, with the speedo in centre, tachometer on left, gas 
and temperature on right.<br>
<br>
The dual-zone AC vents are atop the sound system, leading down to usable 
storage. However, the gear lever is sort-of unergonomic–a bit too back, if you 
use the manual mode, making shifting slightly more difficult. The space for the 
larger glove box was created by downsizing the AC unit, but Nissan says there’s 
no compromise in AC effectiveness; in fact, the airflow has improved.<br>
<br>
The intelligent key is standard on all Altima models. Apparently, it leads to 
battery drain. This happens if you unintentionally press the ignition button two 
times instead of once, to shut down the car – think of it as button bounce. It 
enters the accessories mode and is left there. However, we have to yet to hear 
this complaint from a user or our reader.<br>
<br>
<b>Powertrain</b><br>
The new Altima is the first global application of Nissan’s advanced ‘D’ 
platform, which offers much improved body rigidity and an all-new front 
suspension, with new geometry and shock absorbers with rebound springs. The 
engine mounting position is 30mm lower (with a six-point pendulum-type mounting 
system in place of the previous four-point system on V6 models). A stiffer 
chassis contributes to a reduction in noise and vibration in the cabin and the 
Altima proves it. There are no less than nine cup-holders in the cabin, allowing 
two big cups of coffee for almost everyone in your carpool. <br>
<br>
The subframe-mounted front suspension makes extensive use of aluminium parts. 
The V6 engine in our 3.5SL makes a potent 265 horsepower, being a very close 
relative to the 3.5-liter V6 in the Nissan 350Z sports car, and we used much of 
it on this road. There’s more than enough; in fact, it’s perfect for overtaking 
manoeuvres. The V6 features new twin induction, reduced friction, improved 
cylinder head cooling and new twin knock sensors.<br>
<br>
Engineers have worked with kingpins and half shafts, and believe they have 
raised the bar for other powerful front-wheel-drive cars. Indeed, the torque 
steer in the Altima is extremely mild, which is impressive for a 270hp output. 
New dual exhaust system designs reduce exhaust backpressure by 35 per cent on 
the 4-cylinder, and 50 per cent with the V6. <br>
<br>
<b>Drive</b><br>
When we took the Nissan Altima out for the first time, we noticed immediately 
that this model was different. Its CVT gearbox was made with both infinite 
variations in gear ratio and the six-step or ‘six-speed’ mode. Nissan began 
studying CVT technology in 1979 and offered its first production CVT in 1992 and 
world’s first 3.5-litre, V6 CVT application in 2002.<br>
<br>
The suspension has been redesigned on the new rigid chassis, and its quite firm; 
there’s no swaying in the ‘S’ turns, so the steering stays true. Moreover, it 
wasn’t harsh over the rough parts of the road. The electric power steering, 
speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion, works well, and because it uses less power than 
the hydraulic, it improves gas mileage by a touch. The Altima doesn’t quite feel 
like a sports sedan, but the handling is fairly nimble. We loved it because it’s 
true to us. Its totally responsive and obedient. It did things that the manual 
mode in some expensive cars cannot even dream of. It listens to the driver. We 
challenged it by upshifting all the way up to sixth gear at no more than 60kmph, 
then downshifting back, and it made every shift instead of ignoring them.<br>
<br>
The Altima is now roomier, safer more comfortable and more economical than 
before, and has stylish new looks. It’s a thorough improvement from top to 
bottom, inside and out. In fact, we’d almost compare this to the change to the 
last model from its prior design. It offers a good stand against competitors 
like the Accord, Camry, Legacy and even the Azera. A great all rounder, this 
Altima definitely deserves all the accolades that it receives. </font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<div align="center">

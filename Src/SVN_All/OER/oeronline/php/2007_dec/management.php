<b>A powerful transformation story depends on the CEO’s willingness to make the 
transformation personal, to engage others openly and to spotlight successes as 
they emerge, write Carolyn B. Aiken and Scott P. Keller<br>
</b><br>
In today’s business environment, companies cannot settle for incremental 
improvement; they must periodically undergo performance transformations to get, 
and stay, on top. But what exactly should the CEO be doing, and how different is 
this role from that of the executive team or the initiative’s sponsors?<br>
<br>
Based on a series of interviews conducted with nearly a dozen executives, we 
believe there is no single model for success. But our experience with scores of 
major transformation efforts suggests that four key functions collectively 
define a successful role for the CEO in a transformation:<br>
<br>
People will go to extraordinary lengths for causes they believe in, and a 
powerful transformation story will create and reinforce their commitment. The 
ultimate impact of the story depends on the CEO’s willingness to make the 
transformation personal, to engage others openly and to spotlight successes as 
they emerge. The role of CEOs is unique in that they stand at the top of the 
pyramid and all the other members of the organisation take cues from them. CEOs 
who give only lip service to a transformation will find everyone else doing the 
same.<br>
<br>
<b>Make it meaningful</b><br>
Transformations require extraordinary energy: Employees must fundamentally 
rethink and reshape the business while continuing to run it day to day. Where 
does this energy come from? A powerful transformation story helps employees 
believe in the effort by answering their big questions, which can range from how 
the transformation will affect the company down to how it will affect them.<br>
<br>
<b>Adopt a personal approach</b><br>
CEOs who take time to personalise the story of the transformation can unlock 
significantly more energy for it than those who dutifully present the PowerPoint 
slides that their working teams created for them. Personalising the story forces 
CEOs to consider and share with others the answers to such questions as “Why are 
we changing?”; “How will we get there?”; and “How does this relate to me?”<br>
<br>
Some leaders include experiences and anecdotes from their own lives to underline 
their determination and belief – and to demonstrate that obstacles can be 
overcome. Klaus Zumwinkel, the chairman and CEO of Deutsche Post, talked about 
his passion for mountain climbing, linking the experience of that sport and the 
effort it requires to the company’s transformation journey. The CEO of US-based 
McKesson, John Hammergren, stressed the fact that every employee was or would be 
a patient in the health care system and that this “larger purpose” made a 
difference. “Had we been in the ball-bearing business, I’m not sure it would 
have been as easy to personalise it,” he acknowledges.<br>
<br>
<b>Openly engage others</b><br>
When a CEO’s version of the transformation story is clear, success comes from 
taking it to employees, encouraging debate about it, reinforcing it, and 
prompting people to infuse it with their own personal meaning. Most CEOs invest 
great effort in visibly and vocally presenting the transformation story. 
Executive chairman of Telefonica de Espana, Julio Linares says that, for him, 
the most important and hardest part of the transformation was “to convince 
people of the need for the programme.” N.R. Narayana Murthy, chairman of the 
board and former chief executive of India’s Infosys, agrees: “The first 
responsibility of a leader is to create mental energy among people so that they 
enthusiastically embrace the transformation.”<br>
<br>
Once the story is out, the CEO’s role becomes one of constant reinforcement. As 
P&amp;G CEO Alan G. Lafley says, “Excruciating repetition and clarity are 
important–employees have so many things going on in the operation of their daily 
business that they don’t always take the time to stop, think, and internalise.”<br>
<br>
<b>Spotlight success</b><br>
As the company’s transformation progresses, a powerful way to reinforce the 
story is to spotlight the successes. Sharing such stories helps crystallise the 
meaning of the transformation and gives people confidence that it will actually 
work. Murthy of Infosys describes how high-performing teams were invited to make 
presentations to larger audiences drawn from across the company, “to show other 
people that we value such behaviour.”<br>
<br>
Ravi Kant, the managing director of the integrated Indian auto business Tata 
Motors, deliberately identified people who would serve as examples to others. He 
highlighted the achievements of one young man whose success on a risky project 
and subsequent promotion showed colleagues that talented and determined people 
can rise through the hierarchy.<br>
<br>
The CEO also plays a critical role in ensuring an appropriate balance between 
near-term profit initiatives (those that deliver performance today) and 
organisational-health initiatives (those that build the capacity to deliver 
tomorrow’s results). This is a lesson applied by John Varley, CEO of Barclays: 
“For several years, the focus on initiatives to improve financial performance 
dramatically crowded out attention on franchise health, leaving us with a set of 
issues in some businesses that needed urgent attention. We are addressing those 
issues.” During the transformation, some CEOs even choose to hold separate 
review meetings for short- and long-term objectives in order to ensure that 
companies maintain a balance.<br>
<br>
For CEOs leading a transformation, no single model guarantees success. But they 
can improve the odds by using the techniques we’ve discussed. Together, these 
can powerfully generate the energy needed to achieve a successful performance 
transformation.<br>

Perseverance, diversification and teamwork make up the formula for his success. 
An MBA graduate hailing from Kerala, Ameer Ahmed, Group Managing Director of 
Teejan Group speaks to Jayashankar Menon<br>
<br>
</font>
</b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<img border="0" src="personality.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Hailing from a wealthy family, Ameer started 
his career at the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation and moved up 
the corporate ladder there to become its director. After that short stint with 
KSIDC, he started his own business. Somehow the business didn’t work out well 
and in 1984, Ameer came to Oman and took over an ailing construction company, 
called Teejan.<br>
<br>
“I took over the company, which was making a loss. I think God had given me the 
ability to reengineer the company. And that was what I did. I always used to 
think at least five years ahead. That made me succeed here. I put a stop to the 
losses within six months and drew up a vision plan for five years, which I 
achieved within three years. I always feel that one should not keep all eggs in 
one basket. I am a person who likes multiplicities. That way, Teejan is not 
concentrating on a single business. May be one reason is that the Gulf character 
is like that. You have limitations in growth also in any industry. So we 
diversified into many businesses”.<br>
<br>
<b>Long-term vision</b><br>
Teejan Group has grown from strength to strength and has emerged as a leading 
private sector group with activities spanning from civil and E&amp;M construction, 
turnkey fire fighting systems, laboratory engineering, interior furnishing and 
cleaning works to trading in foods and beverages. Today its operations are 
spread over Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia and India. “Our 
corporate outlook is to give the best service to the customer in every sphere of 
the operation. Our management and technical personnel are specially trained in 
their areas of specialisation, with a clear cut directive to secure long term 
cost-effective product and services with particular emphasis on quality, 
efficiency and HSE.”<br>
<br>
Teejan Trading &amp; Contracting Co. LLC, the flagship of the Teejan Group is an ISO 
9001 Certified Firm with QA/QC procedures with particular attention to project 
management through ISO certification. Teejan faced many challenges from the big 
players in the initial years. “We were fighting with established players. But 
then that is our secret of our success. We have to think big. That was what we 
did and we tightened our belt and moved ahead. When I took over the company 
there were only six co-workers. Currently our strength is 1000 plus. We are 
witnessing tremendous growth and every month we are adding more workers. We have 
three core businesses. Contracting is the business I look after, where we have 
civil, electromechanical and fire engineering. Out of that the fire engineering 
business is the one I like the most. We are the No. 1 company in Oman in fire 
engineering segment. Additionally we have a unit in India as well. We have the 
same business in Dubai and Saudi Arabia too. Fire protection or fire engineering 
is our dream. We acquired a company in India five years back. We are nurturing a 
dream to have a multinational company emerging from India in fire protection in 
the world market in the next five years.”<br>
<br>
Teejan is also No. 2 in the juice business in Oman. Our brand Rani Juice is 
competing with multinational companies. When we acquired the company 10 years 
ago, it had a turnover of a RO100,000. Today we are next to Pepsi Cola in the 
entire segment.”<br>
<br>
Teejan also had its due share of woes. “The construction industry went through a 
bad phase during early 2000, when many companies lowered their shutters. Steel 
prices went through the roof. Fortunately, we survived purely because of our 
diversified activities. We suffered heavy losses but we managed to survive 
because of the fact that our other businesses were doing well”.<br>
<br>
<b>Dedicated beliefs</b><br>
On the personal front, Ameer has represented the Kerala State in basketball. 
Right now, his hobby is social service. “During Gonu, for example, the Indian 
Embassy was kind enough to entrust me with the entire coordination of the 
rehabilitation activities, purely because we did a wonderful job in Gubrah. It 
was purely teamwork. I run a small orphanage in my hometown of Kodungalur. I am 
a deeply religious person. I am trying to be a Muslim. I cannot call myself a 
Muslim. A Muslim is a person in whose hand another person must be safe. The best 
management book I have read is the Holy Quran. I am trying to learn it. I have 
not even learned 10 per cent of it. I am trying to learn understand and practice 
Islam. And that is my achievement.”<br>
<br>
While talking about the work culture in Teejan, he says, “we take care of the 
‘emotional needs’ of our co-workers. I never call them employees. For us, they 
are all extended members of the same family. Due to our efforts to give a 
quality life to our family members, we even won accolades as the ‘Best Place to 
Work’ in Oman in 2005. In fact, we were in the fifth position out of 10 best 
companies for Omanis, third in 10 best companies for expatriates, fifth in top 
five companies for corporate culture, fourth in communications and employment, 
fifth in working conditions and team work, second in recognition, fifth in 
leadership and effectiveness and third in training and career.”<br>
<br>
“Our philosophy has always been quality in execution and timely completion of 
projects, which has been the success of our growth over the period. The 
recognition and goodwill earned on account of this philosophy has stood the test 
of time and even today many clients give the first option to us to take up a 
contract with a right for rejection before considering others. Our commitment 
towards quality has been deep rooted. Our client profiles include major power 
plants, petroleum companies, large industrial establishments, hotels, commercial 
complexes, private villas, residential complexes and government organisations 
like Diwan of Royal Court, Ministry of Housing, Electricity and Water, 
Ministries of Defense, Education, Health, Regional Municipalities,” Ameer adds.</font></p>

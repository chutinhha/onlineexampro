BREAKING RECORDS</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="cover15.jpg" width="175" height="522" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">MSM is on a roller coaster ride this year. MSM-30 Index started the year at 
5,581 points. It touched its peak in 2007 on November 26 at 8,419 points – a 
jump of over 50 per cent in less than 11 months.<br>
<br>
A consistent growth in corporate earnings coupled with better transparency and 
disclosure norms have made Omani stocks attractive for regional investors. 
Almost all sectors, but specially banking and manufacturing, have been doing 
well, aided by a high oil income. In fact, the expectation of better corporate 
earnings continues to drive the market. Regional institutions, who did not take 
much interest in the MSM a few years ago, today have a positive outlook on the 
performance of the Omani market. <br>
<br>
One does not have to look far to seek the reasons for this renewed confidence of 
foreign institutions in the Omani bourse. The country’s GDP growth stood at 8.3 
per cent in June 2007. Also, the average net earnings of 30 leading companies, 
which represent the MSM 30 Index, soared by 29 per cent in the first half.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Reflecting the trend, the MSM general index soared to touch an all-time high of 
8,419 points on November 26. <br>
<br>
The market regulator – the Capital Market Authority (CMA) – has taken a series 
of measures to strengthen transparency and disclosure norms and thereby attract 
foreign institutional investors. The latest move was banning board members and 
top management from trading in shares of their respective companies during the 
period they possess material information undisclosed to the public.<br>
<br>
In the case of financial results, the ban is between the end of every quarter 
and the day on which the company releases financial information to the bourse. 
All listed companies, barring holding firms, are required to announce financial 
results within 30 days of the end of every quarter. Also, the market regulator 
has decided to impose fines on those who fail to disclose financial and other 
information before the stipulated time. This fine ranges from RO1, 500 to RO250, 
depending on the type of violation. Earlier, fines on defaulting companies were 
decided by a disciplinary committee of the CMA on a case- on- case basis.<br>
<br>
These new norms, which were introduced on October 1, are aimed at eliminating 
insider trading, which in turn will protect the interests of small investors. 
Other initiatives like the relaxation of IPO rules for newly established 
companies, new norms on corporate governance and the formation of the Investors’ 
Trust Fund for returning unclaimed dividend money have also helped gain the 
confidence of investing public. Last year, the CMA decided to allow 
newly-established companies to raise funds from the investing public, 
overturning the rule that only a three-year-old company could tap the capital 
markets.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover16.jpg" width="300" height="290" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Although the MSM is a well-regulated market, it does lack stock liquidity. In 
other words, regional institutions, which deal in large volumes, find it 
difficult to find large volumes. Barring a few companies with a large 
shareholder base, the stocks of fundamentally-strong companies in large volumes 
are not available on the MSM. In order to enhance market depth, CMA has 
appointed an international consultancy agency – AtosEuronext – to conduct a 
study on activating the bourse for another five years. This Paris- based 
consultancy agency has suggested sweeping changes on several fronts, including 
the introduction of new instruments, the privatisation and effective promotion 
of the bourse. It also mooted the introduction of derivatives’ trading as part 
of its bigger plan to enhance the depth of the market. The market authorities 
will study the proposal, along with feedback from intermediaries before allowing 
trading in derivative instruments. Presently, the MSM deals in two financial 
instruments – equity and bond.<br>
<br>
The IPOs of Bank Sohar and Galfar Engineering and Contracting have also enhanced 
trading activity on the bourse. Bank Sohar’s RO20 million share offer was 
oversubscribed by more than five times early this year. The stock also witnessed 
much appreciation after listing on the bourse.<br>
<br>
Similarly, Galfar’s RO60 million IPO was also oversubscribed by 13.5 times with 
the company raising RO873 million. The IPO collection was an all- time record in 
Oman’ s corporate history, even surpassing Omantel collection of RO700 million 
for its RO288-million issue. Galfar’s share offer received an overwhelming 
response from regional investors, specially institutions who were looking for 
quality stocks. The company offered 100 million shares to the investing public.<br>
<br>
Three more companies – Takamul, Oman Merchant Bank and Oman Oil Marketing 
Company – are in line to tap the capital market. Takamul, an investment arm of 
the Government, is planning to float a RO20 million IPO. The Oman Merchant Bank, 
which received an initial approval from the Central Bank of Oman, is proposing 
to float an IPO before the year-end to raise part of its paid- up capital. Also, 
the Oman Oil Company announced earlier this year its plans to divest 3 per cent 
stake in the Oman Oil Marketing Company (OOMC). However, these companies have 
not yet finalised a timeframe for floating their issues. <br>
<br>
The banking industry in Oman registered exponential growth during the first nine 
months of 2007. The net profit of the country’s commercial banks increased by 
27.1 per cent at RO145.4 million in this period. <br>
<br>
There was an increase in the deposit rate also, from 1.81 per cent in September 
2006 to 1.99 per cent in September 2007. However, there was a marginal decline 
in the lending rates from 7.46 per cent from 7.46 per cent to 7.33 per cent in 
this period. Also, there was a marginal decline in the interest spreads from 
5.65 per cent to 5.34 per cent.<br>
<br>
As on September 30, 2007, the total assets of commercial banks in the Sultanate 
surged by 34 per cent to reach RO8.98 billion. While the increase in credit, 
which accounted for 64 per cent of the bank’s total assets, was 28.6 per cent at 
RO5.94 billion, the foreign asset portfolio went up by 35.8 per cent from RO1.37 
billion to RO1.86 billion, thanks to the short-term interest rate differential 
in favour of US dollar and easy domestic liquidity conditions.<br>
<br>
As for the private sector deposits, which constituted 80 per cent of the total 
deposits in the industry, the CBO said it was basically broad-based, with 
demand, savings and time deposits increasing by 45.2 per cent, 32.9 per cent and 
16.9 per cent, respectively. At the end of September 2007, the core capital and 
reserves of the banks amounted to RO900.4 million.<br>
<br>
The repository rate of CBO swelled from 6.33 per cent in September 2006 to 6.55 
per cent in September 2007. The central bank’s certificate of deposit rate was 
lower at 3.09 per cent in September 2007 from 4.17 per cent in September 2006. 
The inter-bank rate of CBO stood lower at 2.6 per cent in September 2007 
compared to 3.78 per cent in September 2006.<br>
<br>
The broad money supply (M2) increased by 29.6 per cent to RO5.46 billion as on 
September 2007 while M1, which primarily denoted the currency held with public 
and demand deposits, registered a growth of 37.9 per cent the CBO report added. </font></p>

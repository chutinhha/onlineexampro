</b>Oman’s complex geology has created challenges in almost every aspect of 
hydrocarbon exploration and production. To meet the challenges from the nature, 
Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has kept its focus on expanding the 
technological boundaries to play a catalyst role in the economic development of 
the Sultanate.<br>
<br>
As part of PDO’s commemoration of the 40th anniversary of its first oil export 
cargo, the company celebrated its Technology Day and Exhibition with a ceremony 
at the Oil and Gas Exhibition Centre in November. On the occasion, PDO’s 
Managing Director John Malcolm said, “It is hard to overestimate the importance 
of technology in our day-to-day lives be it at home, our workplace or in the 
world at large. At PDO, technology has dramatically changed the way we do 
business and it has opened up new horizons in all our operations.”<br>
<br>
He further stressed on the importance of the application of cutting-edge 
technologies at PDO: “In recent years, PDO has embarked on several enhanced oil 
recovery projects aimed at sustaining PDO’s oil production for the long term. 
These projects are based in many instance on the state-of-the-art technologies.”<br>
<br>
A short film showing the history of technological advancement at PDO was 
screened at the ceremony. It featured seven technology themes:<br>
<br>
<b>Primary Recovery</b>: The first stage of oil production, in which the natural 
energy in the underground reservoir – say, from an overlying gas accumulation or 
underlying aquifer – drives the hydrocarbons from the reservoir into wells and 
up to surface. As the reservoir pressure declines because of production, it 
often is necessary to implement an artificial lift system, such as a pump, to 
bring the oil to the surface.<br>
<br>
<b>Secondary Recovery</b>: The second stage of hydrocarbon production during 
which an extraneous fluid such as water is injected into the reservoir. The 
purpose of such “water flooding” is to maintain reservoir pressure and to 
displace hydrocarbons toward the producing wells.<br>
<br>
<b>Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)</b>: The production of oil by means other than 
those used in primary and secondary recovery. The commonly applied EOR methods 
fall into three categories: thermal (say, by heating the reservoir with steam to 
reduce the oil’s viscosity), chemical (say, by injecting chemical agents into 
the reservoir to alter the oil’s flow properties) and miscible displacement 
(say, by injecting a gas into the reservoir into which the oil can dissolve). 
PDO is one of the few companies in the world carrying out field-development 
projects in all three EOR categories.<br>
<br>
<b>Natural Gas</b>: The gaseous hydrocarbon on which many of the Government’s 
economic diversification plans are based. Not only is it exported from Oman in 
liquefied form, but also it serves as feedstock for the production of fertilizer 
and other petrochemicals. More than 30 per cent of the hydrocarbon energy that 
PDO currently supplies to its shareholders comes from natural gas. To produce 
and process it in the field, special technologies are sometimes required.<br>
<br>
<b>Environment &amp; Integrity</b>: Technologies that enable PDO to limit the 
environmental impact of its operations, to treat the copious amounts of waste 
water it produces and to ensure that its wells are in good working order.<br>
<br>
<b>“Smart” Fields</b>: The integration of digital information technology with 
the latest drilling, seismic and reservoir-monitoring equipment to produce 
hydrocarbons more efficiently.<br>
<br>
<b>Exploration &amp; Drilling</b>: The technologies applied to find underground 
accumulations of hydrocarbons and to drill wells to reach them.<br>
<br>
“This Technology Day and Exhibition was aimed at showcasing – in an engaging and 
accessible way – the widespread application of new technology in PDO,” said 
Abdul Amir bin Hussein al Ajmi, PDO’s Manager of the External Affairs and 
Communications Department, which organized the event.<br>

<b>MSM index has given incredible returns in 2007</b><br>
<br>
The Muscat Securities Market (MSM) witnessed strong performance during the 
current year. The benchmark MSM-30 general index generated a year to date (as on 
November 15) return of 46.1 per cent beating all other GCC bourses. In fact, in 
Oman, the local stock market has been going through a boom phase in view of 
windfall oil gains and the consequent growth in government spending. Revenues 
from the oil sector still contribute close to half of the country’s GDP, and the 
rise in the international prices of crude has had its positive impact in the 
form of higher current account surplus and excessive liquidity in the financial 
system. Accordingly, the government also has drawn up its expenditure plans, 
which involves hundreds of millions rials to be spent on infrastructure, tourism 
and oil and gas sectors. <br>
<br>
The nominal GDP of Oman grew at a rate of 15.6 per cent in 2006, slower than the 
rate of growth of 24.6 per cent exhibited in 2005 (from a lower base); and still 
this could be considered high in a relative sense, comparing with other emerging 
economies. Diversification has played a key role in the growth of the economy, 
as non-petroleum activities grew at a rate of 34.9 per cent, while petroleum 
activities declined to reach a growth rate of 14.8 per cent from a high of 43.9 
per cent in 2005. Non-oil exports climbed 46.3 per cent in 2006, while oil 
exports retracted to a mere 8.1 per cent from 45.2 per cent in 2005. </font>

<br>
<b>Economic Expansion</b><br>
This economic expansion, never before witnessed in the history of the country, 
has been the driving force for local companies in expanding their toplines and 
bottomlines. In fact, for many industrial establishments listed in the local 
securities market, a booming GCC market in terms of rising construction 
activities and other capital investments has been a blessing.<br>
<br>
During the first nine months of the current fiscal, the banking, industrial and 
services sectors saw their aggregate earnings grow by 29.2 per cent, 26.5 per 
cent and 24.7 per cent, respectively. As against this, the three sectoral 
indices of the banking, industrial and services sectors gave a return of 51.6 
per cent, 44.8 per cent and 39.4 per cent, respectively. The rising ‘wealth 
effect’ and large leveraged investments in capital goods has been driving the 
banking sector profits. With large-scale asset build-up in their books, the 
banks in Oman are expected to report even higher growth in earnings in the 
ensuing quarters. Strong demand scenario within Oman as also in the region has 
given a major boost to the manufacturing sector, with most units being forced to 
add more capacities to meet the fast-growing demand. Again, with growing 
infrastructure and rising economic activity, the services sector too has been a 
major beneficiary, with many companies reporting high-double-digit growth in 
earnings.<br>
<br>
Two important events that marked the rise in market activity and led to the rise 
in general index by over 2500 points were the resurgence in the index 
heavyweight Omantel, and the primary float of one of the largest family-owned 
businesses in Oman, Galfar Engineering. During the third quarter, Omantel 
announced that the Board has approved the acquisition of a majority stake in 
Worldcall Ltd, a Pakistan-based telecom company. This was perceived by investors 
to be the right strategy for a company, which faces near-saturation in its 
operations within Oman. However, the news that brought back large institutional 
investors to the counter was the decision by the government to reduce the 
royalty being paid by Omantel and its competitor company for fixed and mobile 
phone services to 7 per cent instead of 10 per cent and 12 per cent, 
respectively. Among the other measures taken by the government was divestment of 
a portion of its stake in Omantel to a strategic investor. The stock appreciated 
almost 36 per cent on this news, while it weighed almost 20 per cent in the 
MSM-30 index! The breaching of 6000, 7000 and 8000 levels of the index were all 
witnessed in 2007, with the last one happening much sooner than expected.<br>
<br>
Galfar Engineering and Contracting Company’s initial public offering mobilised 
RO872.97 million, indicating an oversubscription of 14.5 times. Galfar made an 
all time record in IPO collection in the Sultanate, even bigger than the funds 
collected by Omantel. The institutional investors, who got 40 per cent of the 
IPO, offered RO790.72 million while individuals put in RO82.25 million. As 
expected, Galfar shares witnessed a strong secondary market, as institutions 
were unable to get all the shares they wanted. High net worth individual 
investors too showed strong interest, as they paid just RO0.602 for a share 
which returned over 82 per cent upside on the first day of listing. The listing 
of such large cap companies is bound to increase the depth of the market, which 
would be largely beneficial for large institutions.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<font size="1" face="Verdana"><b>Performance of other GCC markets</b><br>
Apart from Oman, all GCC markets also ended in the positive territory for the 
year to date (YTD) period ending November 15. The Abu Dhabi market was the 
second largest YTD gainer, with the general index there gaining 40.19 per cent. 
The real estate index was the ace performer there, ending with a YTD gain of 
153.72 per cent followed by the banking and industrial indices, which generated 
YTD returns of 30.66 per cent and 23.11 per cent, respectively. The Dubai market 
was the next best performing market gaining 36.32 per cent YTD. Investment and 
the banking indices were among the top achievers on the Dubai exchange, closing 
86.75 per cent and 33.44 per cent, respectively. The Doha market generated a YTD 
return of 35.45 per cent on the back of strong buying specially in the 
industrial, services and banking counters, which increased by 82.97 per cent, 
29.98 per cent and 26.54 per cent, respectively. The Kuwaiti and Bahraini 
markets were up by 24.87 per cent and 18.81 per cent, respectively. While the 
banking index was the top performer on the Kuwaiti bourse, gaining 43.91 per 
cent, the investment index ruled the Bahraini bourse, rising by 22.44 per cent. 
The Saudi bourse, after staying in the red for most of the year, recovered in 
recent months, generating an YTD return of 16.26 per cent as on November 15. The 
insurance and industrial indices performed well and gained 57.95 per cent and 
47.76 per cent, respectively.<br>
<br>
It needs to be highlighted here that the Muscat Securities Market remained the 
‘top gainer’ over all other GCC markets, with a YTD return of 46.1 per cent. The 
factors that helped this market to be the best wealth creator in the region are 
the strong performance of the local corporates (on the back of the current 
economic boom), lower volatility in the market as compared to its GCC peers and 
better corporate governance practices, which leaves lesser room for bad 
surprises to large institutional investors.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>With its Deputy President, 43 per cent of its Cabinet, more than 30 per cent 
of its Members of Parliament and 20 of its Ambassadors women, South Africa 
occupies one of the top spots in world rankings as far as women representation 
is concerned. South African Ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman, HE Yacoob Abba 
Omar, explains how this was achieved and the challenges his country still faces 
in promoting women’s role in society<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="guest.jpg" width="135" height="236" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">When Nelson Mandela became President in 1994, the new South Africa was faced 
with a situation where the black people – who are in the majority – were the 
poorest in the country. Decades of apartheid had left a legacy of illiteracy and 
a lack of skills, the worst affected being black women. It was this ‘double 
oppression’ of women – on the basis of race and gender – which the government 
decided to address with great urgency.<br>
<br>
The strides made over the past 13 years are impressive. In the early 1990s, 
almost 28 per cent had no schooling at all. By 2001, almost 90 per cent were 
receiving some education and by 2006, universal education for young women was 
the norm. At that time, women occupied about 8 per cent of managerial positions 
in the private sector. By 2005, this had risen to almost 15 per cent. <br>
<br>
Oman and South Africa share many features, perhaps the most striking being our 
leaders’ commitment to uplifting the status of women in society. Women in South 
Africa have ensured throughout our history that they will fight, and fight hard, 
for their emancipation.<br>
<br>
In 1954, South African women drew up a Women’s Charter, declaring in its 
preamble that “We, the women of South Africa, declare our aim of striving for 
the removal of all laws, regulations, conventions, and customs acting against us 
as women, and that deprive us in any way of our inherent right to the advantages 
and opportunities that society offers to any one section of the population.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="guest1.jpg" width="250" height="263" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">On August 9, 1956, women from all race groups were mobilised to support the 
demands of the Women’s Charter. Thousands marched to the seat of political power 
in Pretoria. The importance of that day can be appreciated by the fact that in 
the new South Africa, August 9 is celebrated as Women’s Day.<br>
<br>
The advances women have enjoyed in recent years are largely due to their 
continued involvement in the political and economic life of our country. Long 
after 1956, women continue to occupy senior positions in provincial governments, 
where four of the nine premiers are women; in the Constitutional Court, and in 
the public service, where they make up about 53 per cent of the labour force.<br>
<br>
<b>Political will<br>
</b>Three elements have ensured this spectacular progress: leading from the 
front, gender mainstreaming and legal protection. President Mbeki’s statement is 
indicative of the tone the leaders’ have set out: “No government in South Africa 
could ever claim to represent the will of the people if it failed to address the 
central task of the emancipation of women in all its elements.”<br>
<br>
The former Speaker of the House, Ms Frene Ginwala, as well as the current 
Speaker, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and Deputy 
President, Ms Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, are but four examples of women in 
high-profile positions who hold up high the flag of women’s emancipation. 
High-level coordination of gender-related issues is made possible through the 
Office of the Status of Women (OSW) in the President’s Office. The OSW works 
through gender focal points in each of the government departments.<br>
<br>
<b>Social campaigns<br>
</b>Gender mainstreaming has been facilitated by ongoing campaigns to raise 
awareness amongst men and women of the rights and protections women enjoy. Key 
pieces of legislation empowering women have been enacted. These give expression 
to the constitutional rights affecting women. Government policy has also taken 
steps against the feminisation of poverty. These include free healthcare for 
pregnant mothers and for children up to six years old.<br>
<br>
The Government has also required businesses to submit a detailed breakdown of 
the composition of their workforce and ownership. Sectoral charters have been 
developed, setting out the target each economic sector is supposed to achieve, 
with clear timeframes. Businesses and government bodies are required to submit 
plans to achieve gender representation and give annual reports on their 
progress. These measures have seen women unemployment slowly decline while per 
capita income has increased.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<font face="Verdana" size="1">
<br>
<b>Upholding rights</b><br>
The government has set up a Commission for Gender Equality (CGE), with the task 
of investigating cases where women’s rights have been ignored. The November 2006 
issue of Leadership magazine reported this case illustrating the kind of 
challenges women still face in South Africa: The father of two young girls died 
in a rural area which was covered by African Customary Law. Such law recognises 
legal title only through the male line and hence the girls could not inherit 
their father’s property. The CGE took the case up to the Constitutional Court, 
which declared that male primogeniture was unconstitutional. The CGE was careful 
to show that the girls were not against their customs and traditions, except 
where these went against constitutional guarantees.<br>
<br>
While women make up 24 per cent of the senior management in the Public Services, 
there is a recognition that much has to be done before this sector becomes truly 
representative of South African society. There also remains much to be done in 
the private sector. Women remain under-represented on the boards of corporations 
– only 7.1 per cent compared to about 8.4 per cent in Australia, 11.2 per cent 
in Canada, and almost 14 per cent in the US. This is notwithstanding the 
successes women have shown in opening and running their own businesses.<br>
<br>
Public surveys have shown that all women are not aware of their rights and that 
men have to increase their commitment to the emancipation of women. In this 
regard, President Mbeki declared on August 9 this year that the “struggle to 
emancipate, empower and liberate our women cannot be complete without the full 
participation of our men.” </font>

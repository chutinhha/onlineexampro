        <b>Global insurance leader AIG recently launched its new general 
        insurance operation in Oman. Charles Bouloux, President AIG MEMSA 
        discusses AIG Oman’s ambitious plans with OER</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>
        <img border="0" src="insurance.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">What kind of insurance products are you offering in the ME region?</b><br>
        We offer home, travel and motor insurance solutions to individuals and 
        small business owners. AIG Oman is a branch of AIG MEMSA. We will 
        provide insurance solutions for direct as well as reinsurance clients. 
        Insurance Company Ltd, which was launched in September 2006 as the 
        regional headquarters for the MEMSA region, is located in the Dubai 
        International Financial Centre (DIFC). We have brought AIG’s industry 
        leadership in disciplined underwriting standards to corporations and 
        consumers across the Middle East, Mediterranean and South Asia.<br>
        <br>
        We recognise the Middle East as developing into one of the world’s most 
        important centres of financial activity. Having been in this region for 
        over 50 years, we are excited at the opportunity to contribute to the 
        ongoing growth of the region. As a well-established player in the Middle 
        East, we are attuned to the specific needs of each market by constantly 
        evaluating them in order to develop new products and services to meet 
        these unique needs. Insurance has always been important for the economic 
        growth of any country as it plays a vital part in managing the 
        associated risks. AIG MEMSA benefits from 87 years of experience in 
        delivering innovative insurance solutions through a network that 
        currently spans more than 130 countries, reaching 65 million customers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How would you assess the Oman insurance scenario?</b><br>
        AIG companies are present in almost every major Arabian market and this 
        experience has provided us an edge over various other companies as AIG 
        can come up with tailor-made insurance solutions based on its experience 
        in similar markets. The Omani insurance market is growing at the rate of 
        18-20 per cent and AIG naturally is keen to be a player in this market. 
        The Omani staff share the vision of AIG and of His Majesty in 
        diversifying the economy, globalising it and contributing to the skills 
        of Omani workers.<br>
        <br>
        In Oman, people are not worried too much other than motor insurance. 
        About the consumer, awareness of their children or their clients is low. 
        I would like to see that raised remarkably. After Cyclone Gonu, people 
        realised that there is huge risk involved in day-to-day life. Their 
        assets are no longer small assets. So there is a change in the people’s 
        attitude. Certainly, there are perceptible changes happening in Oman and 
        we are encouraged to be a part of that change.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What are the special products for your Omani patrons?</b><br>
        We offer insurance products for specific areas like home auto and 
        travel. We are also introducing a product called disaster cash, where in 
        the event of an unforeseen event, cash can be provided to tide over the 
        crisis. We have been offering products to the corporate world, but we 
        will now have products for individuals in Oman. The products would be 
        distributed through agents, banks, brokers, wherever there is a contact 
        point. In many countries we even use supermarkets to sell our products. 
        AIG is a global organisation and recognises that capacity building is 
        essential for service delivery. Wherever training is necessary it would 
        be provided to the agents. Upgrading skills of the local people is one 
        of the things we wanted to do.<br>
        <br>
        We already are very much actively involved in providing commercial 
        insurances, which are like marine insurance, fire insurance, energy and 
        infrastructure insurance. We are planning to bring consumer related 
        insurances now, which are automobile insurance, home insurance, travel 
        insurance, small business packages etc.<br>
        <br>
        Even during the cyclone disaster we paid some very heavy sums in terms 
        of claims. If you are talking about commercial insurances almost all 
        lines of commercial insurances have this kind of clause, which is the 
        flood clause. We provide insurance for that. Coming to the micro level, 
        like for instance the automobile insurance or home insurance, there also 
        flood is covered and we compensate for that as well.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What is your perception of the Middle East economy?</b><br>
        The Middle East has had a transition to another phase in its economic 
        development. There has been social development as well. As a result, 
        opportunities are greatly enhanced. The way business is developing and 
        small businessmen are trying to start small businesses and develop them 
        into big ones only proves that there are big opportunities. We need to 
        educate them about risk management and try to get them covered by 
        insurance. The tropical cyclone Gonu is a big example where many people 
        lost their cars. Had they insured in time, chances were great that they 
        would have got the money back for their damaged vehicles.<br>
        <br>
        <b>AIG is a late entrant in the Oman market. Having been in the Middle 
        East for five decades, what made you enter now?</b><br>
        We have had some links through our underwriting business. As you know, 
        we are the big underwriters in the world. We wrote big businesses here 
        through international market places. Some of the commercial businesses 
        we wrote from Saudi Arabia. Social development is going on in this 
        market place and it encourages us to come to the next stage.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Do you think this is the right time to penetrate markets like Oman?</b><br>
        Yes. People generally are changing from what they were doing and the way 
        they were working. They are moving on to the next stage on their own, 
        families, businesses, etc. So, we want to be with them doing that.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How big is the Qurum AIG Oman branch?</b><br>
        To start with, we have around 12 employees. We have 90 odd employees 
        working in Dubai and that is our back office. All the technical 
        expertise is available over there like the way we call underwriters, 
        claim experts, actuaries etc., they are all based out of Dubai. Right 
        now we are operating from Muscat. Gradually we will make our presence 
        felt in other parts of the Sultanate.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Can you talk about your financial projection and drivers of the 
        growth?</b><br>
        The insurance industry overall believes that the growth will continue at 
        around 18-20 per cent, which is a good growth. Since the economy is also 
        growing, we are very positive about the sustainability of the growth. 
        Our growth in the Middle East is about 45 per cent. We are projecting 
        around 35 per cent growth in Oman. It is important to state here that we 
        have been in Oman as commercial underwriters. Now we have plans and 
        strategies to go into the consumer line offering unique products, say in 
        travel insurance and we also have plans to service individuals. We will 
        utilise our large capacity for the big risks.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What is your cross-border overview of key players as the competition 
        is stiff?</b><br>
        Basically insurance is a sector where pretty much boundaries don’t 
        matter that much because there is a very important part which is called 
        the capacity or the reinsurance. So, lot of the local players also rely 
        on the major players for reinsurance. We have been present in the Middle 
        East for few years. However we have been involved heavily in insuring 
        risks for many years because we were providing insurance capacity to 
        other players who are over here.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Is there any JV involved?</b><br>
        No. It is a 100 per cent AIG entity.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Talking about reinsurance, more and more insurance companies who are 
        operating in Oman are relying on reinsurance, especially after the 
        cyclone. What is your view?</b><br>
        We have a separate cell and loads of funds for compensation. So, I don’t 
        think we will rely on reinsurance. We are large underwriters, which 
        means, in reality that we retain much of the risks we write. So, we have 
        less reliance to reinsurance compared to other companies. That is why 
        when we provide cover it is mostly with our protection.<br>

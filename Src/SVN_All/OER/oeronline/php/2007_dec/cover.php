As we look back on the developments in 2007, one message comes out 
clearly–though Oman is integrating with the international market and 
strengthening bilateral relationships, it is not doing so at the expense of 
surrendering its sovereignty and national pride. Despite persuasion and pressure 
from neighbouring states, Oman refused to be part of the GCC monetary union. 
Given the most conservative growth among the GCC member-states, analysts 
believed that ‘Oman seemed certain to benefit from the much vaunted “catch-up 
effect” of the monetary union and Oman was not struggling to meet the negotiated 
requirements in terms of fiscal policy-budget deficits’. HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi 
Macki, Minister of National Economy, categorically stated that Oman had 
reservations over the lack of progress made on obtaining pre-requisites for a 
successful union by 2010 and expressed aversion to surrendering the nation’s 
economic sovereignty. Analysts can always argue the pros and cons of Oman’s 
decision to withdraw but the move shows the tough character of the Sultanate and 
proves that it will not buckle under pressure from regional or international 
communities to safeguard its own interests.<br>
<br>
In another exemplary case, Oman withstood the onslaught of nature’s fury when 
Cyclone Gonu hit its shores in June, leaving behind a trail of mass destruction 
of infrastructure and loss of lives. Despite relief offers from across the 
border, Oman relied on its own strength to bring life back to normal and as we 
close the year, the impact of Gonu on the gross national income seems to have 
been minimal. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover2.jpg" width="250" height="166" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">But, as we look back, we find that the year certainly had its share of pitfalls 
for Oman. Despite signing the free trade agreement (FTA) with the US in record 
time, Oman has not been able to implement it so far. The cost of living has gone 
up substantially as a result of ‘imported inflation’ due to higher oil prices 
and US dollar erosion. To make matters worse, rents are hitting the roof. The 
authorities’ repeated warnings to retailers to keep consumer prices under 
control and introduction of rent cap has had a limited impact. <br>
<br>
No wonder, Omanis are attracted to higher pay packets in other countries. Many 
expatriates, specially from India, the traditional feeder market for GCC 
countries, are moving back to their native place. If we speak to any senior 
manager in Oman, he states that his/her biggest challenge is to attract the 
right talent from India as savings’ propensity for an expat in Oman has eroded 
considerably. This talent crunch is pinching the corporate sector hard, as the 
economy is in a high gear.<br>
<br>
Though it has been heartening to see women gaining more prominence in driving 
the country forward, but it was painful to find that the Majlis Al Shura 
elections failed to elect even a single woman member. Perhaps, talented women 
with a mass appeal need to come forward in enough numbers to bring women power 
to the fore.<br>
<br>
On the positive note, as you read ahead, you will see that Oman has made 
substantial progress in key sectors in 2007. More projects have been announced 
and existing tourism projects have made a major headway. The telecom industry 
has continued its excellent performance by extending its penetration. The 
industries have been the real star of the year, as Omani exports reached record 
levels. The financial market is on a roll, with the MSM at an all-time high and 
banking attracting foreign players with its strong performance. As per data 
available up to September 2007, net oil revenues have gone down significantly 
which is a cause of worry. We now take sector-wise look at how Oman has fared 
during the year.<br>

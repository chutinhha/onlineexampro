					Crenshaw is one of the most popular and talented players on 
					the grueling PGA circuit. His all-American looks, charisma 
					and grace under pressure have made him a gallery favourite 
					from his days at the University of Texas, where he was 
					heralded as the next Jack Nicklaus, to the 1984 Masters 
					tournament, where he ended a decade of frustration to 
					capture his first major championship title. His second 
					victory in April 1995 secured his place in &#8232;golf history.<br>
					<br>

					Milestones</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Ben Crenshaw was involved in two of the most emotional golf 
					course scenes of the 1990s. His first victory was at the 
					1995 Masters, just days after the death of his mentor and 
					friend, the legendary golf teacher Harvey Penick. Crenshaw 
					was a pallbearer at Penick’s funeral and four days later he 
					became Masters Champion. After his final putt, he collapsed 
					into the arms of his caddie while the tears flowed.<br>
					<br>
					In 1999, Crenshaw was Ryder Cup captain at The Country Club 
					in Brookline, Mass., where the US team was far behind. “I am 
					a big believer in fate,” Crenshaw said that night. “I have a 
					good feeling about tomorrow. That’s all I’m gonna say.”<br>
					The next day, the US staged its greatest Ryder Cup comeback 
					ever, culminating in the raucous celebration on the 17th 
					green when Justin Leonard’s long putt sealed it for the 
					Americans. Crenshaw and Tom Kite were childhood friends and 
					rivals in Austin, Texas. While a senior in high school, 
					Crenshaw placed 32nd in the US Open, prompting Lee Trevino 
					to call him “the best eighteen-year-old golfer I’ve ever 
					seen.” At the University of Texas, Crenshaw shared the 1972 
					NCAA Championship with teammate Kite. Crenshaw turned pro in 
					1973 and won his first tournament as a professional, the 
					Texas Open. His “golden boy” image and boyish looks led to a 
					strong following among female fans, whose ranks were dubbed 
					“Ben’s Bunnies” or “Ben’s Wrens.”<br>
					<br>
					Crenshaw would go on to win 19 times on the PGA Tour, 
					including two majors. After his competitive days on the PGA 
					Tour ended, Crenshaw focused on golf course design, with 
					only occasional flashes on the Champions Tour. With partner 
					Bill Coore, Crenshaw designed some of the most acclaimed 
					golf courses of the 1990s and early 21st century, including 
					Kapalua Bay Resort in Hawaii and Sand Hills Golf Club in 
					Nebraska. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame 
					in 2002.<br>
					<br>

					Trivia</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Crenshaw had occasional bursts of temper on the course, and 
					his “Gentle Ben” nickname was given to him sarcastically. He 
					broke his putter in anger in a singles match at the 1987 
					Ryder Cup and putted the rest of the match with his 1-iron 
					and sand wedge. Crenshaw lost the match to Eamonn Darcy. 
					Besides, he has one of the worst playoff records at 0-8, 
					including a loss in the 1979 PGA Championship playoff. 
					Sandy-haired, blue-eyed Ben Crenshaw, who stands five feet 
					nine inches tall and weighs 160 pounds, has an easy-going 
					manner both on and off the golf links that has earned him 
					the nickname of “Gentle Ben.” <br>

					&nbsp;A report by <b>Khalfan al Rahbi</b>, <b>Fatma al 
					Araimi</b>, <b>Visvas Paul D Karra</b> and <b>Muhammed Nafie</b><br>
					<br>
					<br>
					It was 40 years ago that Oman made its historic tryst with 
					the Renaissance, ushering in a new dawn of progress and 
					prosperity in the country. In his landmark oration capturing 
					the essence of this great transition moment, His Majesty 
					Sultan Qaboos bin Said had promised to transform the country 
					‘into a prosperous one with a bright future’ and called on 
					people to work in unity and cooperation for designing the 
					future course of the nation.<br>
					<br>
					The visionary leader has proved as good as his words and the 
					people have accepted the challenge of the future with a 
					remarkable sense of responsibility and commitment. Over the 
					last forty years Oman has been rediscovering itself. A 
					farsighted leader and his dedicated people have created the 
					country’s history anew. While the country commemorates the 
					40th anniversary of its National Day, it is a moment to 
					celebrate not only the triumphs and achievements but also 
					the grandeur of the striving and efforts behind it and the 
					vision and ideals which moulded it. As Albert Einstein 
					famously said all that is valuable in human society depends 
					upon the opportunity for development accorded to the 
					individual. Oman has made remarkable strides towards the 
					development of its human resources which, in turn, has 
					significantly contributed to its social development and 
					economic growth.<br>
					<br>
					It is also the moment to celebrate our national integration 
					which helped us achieve what a disoriented and under- 
					resourced country could never dream of in 1970. The joining 
					together of all people-including those who had left for 
					greener pastures and the erstwhile disgruntled exiles- under 
					one umbrella to get the nation a respected position in the 
					comity of nations was an extraordinarily inspiring event in 
					the history of any nation. In the following pages, some 
					eminent personalities and business heads walk down memory 
					lane recollecting the phenomenal transformation of the 
					country over the last four decades.

					<br>
					<b>Shura Council stands out as a proud symbol of the 
					parliamentary culture in the country, says HE Sheikh Ahmed 
					bin Mohammed Al Issai, Chairman of Shura Council</b><br>
					<br>
					The 40th anniversary of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said 
					coming to power in the country is a moment of national pride 
					in the mind of each and every Omani. It marks an auspicious 
					moment which will remain ineffable in the memory of Omani 
					people. The great achievements in this prosperous era 
					include the establishment of a modern and integrated state 
					with public institutions, laws, constitution and big 
					infrastructure facilities in all governorates and regions of 
					the country.<br>
					<br>
					These achievements are very conspicuous in all areas of 
					development especially in the progress of the life of Omani 
					people who are the real wealth of the nation. His Majesty 
					accorded top priority to the development of human resources 
					in the country through educating and training people and 
					equipping them with basic skills which will enable them to 
					work and to bring good for themselves, their society and the 
					country as a whole. <br>
					<br>
					The development of education is one of the significant 
					milestones in our development. These achievements include 
					providing quality health services, linking the whole country 
					with a good network of roads, quality water and electricity 
					services and many other things. <br>
					<br>
					Shura Council stands out as a symbol of civilisation in the 
					country. The functions of Shura began with the setting up of 
					a State Consultative Council in 1981. And after ten years, 
					exactly in 1991, the Shura Council came into existence.<br>
					<br>
					Since then, it continues to play a vital role in discussing 
					and studying various social issues, laws and bills referred 
					to it by the government and various other issues referred by 
					His Majesty. The Shura system was improved by setting up of 
					a State Council which also carries out significant national 
					responsibilities. Both State and Shura Councils together 
					constitute the Council of Oman. The Council of Oman’s 
					session begins every year with His Majesty’s speech focusing 
					on the actions to resolve various issues of the country. <br>
					<br>
					Since 1970 the country has accorded more importance to human 
					resource development and development plans. The forthcoming 
					Eighth Five Year Plan from 2011 to 2015 envisages massive 
					investment in industrial and tourism sectors which will be 
					greatly beneficial to Oman and its people. Basic and higher 
					education in the country will develop more with the increase 
					in the number of schools, colleges and private universities. 
					Education and health continue to be focal areas in the 
					government’s development priorities.<br>
					<br>
					One of the most prominent features of modern Oman is 
					security and stability that the Sultanate enjoys in a world 
					fraught with conflicts and problems. There is no doubt that 
					the insight of His Majesty, his political wisdom and realism 
					in dealing with foreign issues made Oman an oasis of peace 
					and stability and its citizens well-respected in all 
					countries of the world.<br>
					<br>
					The momentum of internal development coupled with 
					constructive foreign relations, establishment of the rule of 
					law and various public institutions, the development of 
					Shura Council, the importance accorded to the development of 
					Omani people and the economic policy focusing on 
					diversification of income sources are all positive 
					indicators that Oman will continue to march and fulfill its 
					ambition in all areas of life.<br>
					<br>
					Forty years is not a big time in the rise of any people. But 
					we have achieved a lot under the leadership of His Majesty 
					who created this modern state ­­ a nation that each Omani is 
					proud of and is widely appreciated all over the world.</font><p align="left" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

					<b>HE Mohammed Al Zubair, Adviser to His Majesty for Economic 
					Planning Affairs, likens Oman in 1970 to a dried tree which 
					sprouted again after the rain<br>
					</b>
					<br>
					Before 1970, Muscat (the area which now falls within Muscat 
					governorate) had two gates. One was located in the area 
					where Al Nahdah hospital now stands while the other one 
					separated Muscat from interiors of Oman. The second gate 
					which was used for imposing tariffs on the goods used to be 
					closed at night. But in the days just before the Renaissance 
					government vehicles and oil vehicles which had license were 
					allowed to go.<br>
					<br>
					Muscat (the area which now falls within Muscat city) was 
					surrounded by four gates: the big gate, the small gate, Al 
					Mathaib gate and Waljat gate. All these gates were closed by 
					9 pm, and 15 minutes before the closing of the gates drum 
					beats would be heard from Al Mirani Castle followed by 
					cannon firing announcing the closing of the gates. Those who 
					wished to enter after the closure of the city had to hold a 
					lantern (kerosene lamp) while they moved inside the city. If 
					the lamp was extinguished, its owner would be imprisoned 
					till the next morning and investigated. “Some of my friends 
					were troubled by this as our old house (now Bait Al Zubair 
					Museum) was located within the gates,” says HE Mohammed Al 
					Zubair, Adviser to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said for 
					Economic Planning Affairs.<br>
					<br>
					This heavy fortification was because a number of thefts 
					occurred in the area in the 40s and a foreign dignitary was 
					assassinated which alerted authorities that the number of 
					police personnel was not sufficient. But increasing the 
					number of police personnel was not possible at that time. 
					Therefore the system of gates, oil and kerosene lamps to see 
					the movement of individuals within the city came into force.<br>
					But the news of Renaissance was not a surprise to Al Zubair. 
					“Around six months before, we felt that a political change 
					was bound to happen. and at last the reality dawned on us on 
					July 23.”<br>
					<br>
					HE Al Zubair was among those who arranged the reception for 
					the new Sultan from Dhofar. They bought in bulk all the red 
					cloths – which was called Bandera – available in the market. 
					HE Al Zubair wrote the welcome boards with his hand and 
					helped many of his relatives to do so. They set up these 
					boards in all parts of Muscat and even in the palace. “When 
					the new leader and Sultan arrived at Bait Al Falaj Airport 
					House and delivered his historic speech it made the hearts 
					of the Omanis love him and elated over the Blessed 
					Renaissance.” In those times, Muscat was almost devoid of 
					major structures. The only major structure in Ruwi area was 
					the Bait Al Falaj airport which was situated in the midst of 
					farmlands. Even the spectacle of an aircraft coming from the 
					top of the mountains to land on the runway of the airport 
					was frightening to many people.</font><p align="left" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

					<br>
					“Oman after Renaissance is like a dried tree which received 
					rain and sprouted again after its death ,” says HE Al Zubair 
					describing the Sultanate after His Majesty took the reins of 
					government in the country. After 1970, everyone was drawn to 
					work in all fields and to perform different activities that 
					they were not able to do earlier in order to help the new 
					government. Everyone was willing to assist the government in 
					achieving development, especially since the country’s 
					population was very small and many people were immigrants. 
					Some of them returned immediately after hearing the news and 
					some of them came after waiting for a while. “Today our 
					country. is appreciated by everyone, as evident in the visit 
					of eminent personalities and senior dignitaries to the 
					country,” Al Zubair adds.<br>

					<b>In 1970, His Eminence Sheikh Ahmad bin Hamad Al Khalili, 
					Grand Mufti of the Sultanate felt that the country was on 
					the threshold of a new era</b><br>
					<br>
					The achievements the Sultanate made under the leadership of 
					His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said are plenty. But one of 
					the most important achievements has been the development of 
					Omani human resources. Omani citizens have become able to 
					perform in various areas of life and played a remarkable 
					role in the Renaissance. “The development of human resources 
					is one of the most important of all achievements, because it 
					is different from building structures, says His Eminence 
					Sheikh Ahmad bin Hamad Al-Khalili, Grand Mufti of the 
					Sultanate. Buildings can be made in a short period, but 
					saving man from underdevelopment and making him advanced and 
					capable of understanding his time and its issues are not 
					that easy.<br>
					<br>
					“Omani citizens are obliged to thank God for these blessings 
					and use them for their spiritual and ethical uplift,” says 
					Khalili. He reiterates that we need to synthesise spiritual 
					renaissance with material renaissance. For, material 
					renaissance devoid of spirituality is of no value. “So this 
					Renaissance demands us to thank God if we really want to 
					maintain it. We also need to take utmost care to preserve 
					our faith and spiritual values and strengthen our 
					Renaissance with good deeds and lofty morals.”<br>
					<br>
					Referring to the main reasons that contributed to these 
					achievements, His Eminence Al Khalili says, “Sincerity of 
					leadership and the harmony between the top and bottom of 
					society are the main reasons for these achievements.” The 
					people of Oman were awakened by the Renaissance to 
					understand their worth and potentials.<br>
					<br>
					Recalling the moments when His Majesty came to power in 
					1970, he says, “I felt that we were on the threshold of a 
					new era and the change would liberate people from narrowness 
					to broadness, from rigidity to openness and from constrains 
					to relaxation. We received the news with joy, because people 
					were elated with this and they became optimistic that today 
					will be better than yesterday and tomorrow will be better 
					than today.<br>
					Referring to the future of the country, he says, “The future 
					of the country in the prosperous era of His Majesty will be 
					a bright one. If the country could achieve such a great 
					success starting from zero, there is no doubt that the 
					future built on these achievements will be far bigger. With 
					sincerity and harmony between the top and the bottom we 
					could achieve bigger achievements.”<br>

					We were in Baushar when a messenger came to my father with a 
					letter from Sheikh Ahmed bin Ibrahim Al Harthy who was the 
					administrator of Al Dakhliyah. The letter brought in the 
					happy news about the upcoming changes in the Sultanate. It 
					also quoted the famous speech by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos 
					bin Said asking Omanis to forget about the past and inviting 
					them to stand for unity.<br>
					<br>
					It is easy for a person to speak of any event that happens 
					in the world today, but it is not that easy to talk about 
					the Renaissance which provided us with welfare in this world 
					and happiness hereafter. It has brought about all 
					achievements, welfare and goodness that now we are living 
					with. There are men in history who came to build their 
					nations and people and I believe that His Majesty, with all 
					the achievements he has brought to the country, is one of 
					those rare historical figures.<br>

					<b>Comprehensive growth</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
					<br>
					His Majesty accorded a lot of importance to the development 
					of human resources. He understood the significance of 
					education and knowledge in this regard as he famously said, 
					“We will know our children, even under the shade of the 
					trees.” He set up schools, institutes, college and 
					universities for this society which did not have access to 
					the world of education prior to 1970. There were only three 
					schools in the country until that time – one each in Muscat, 
					Muttrah and Salalah. His Majesty surpassed all boundaries 
					and rose up to the expectations and aspirations of the 
					people His Majesty also gave priority to providing health 
					services and set up a number of health service institutions. 
					Today the Sultanate is one of the few countries that managed 
					to provide high quality health services. Besides, he 
					provided people with other services such as electricity, 
					water, roads, airports and ports, and promoted agriculture. 
					He was also awakened to the importance of food security and 
					supported people working in agriculture and fisheries and 
					various other trades in order to make them self-sufficient 
					in their respective jobs Another major achievement was the 
					system of safety and security as understood by anyone who 
					comes to the country. Everybody can see symbols of this 
					development anywhere in the country. When one goes up Jabal 
					Shams, road facilities, electricity and other services there 
					are indicators to the fact that the Blessed Renaissance has 
					reached there also.<br>

					<b>A model for development</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
					<br>
					<b>The achievements brought about by His Majesty are really 
					indescribable. All these things in this country constitute a 
					model for progress in security, health, education, 
					transportation, roads and electricity in the country. </b> <br>
					<br>
					His Majesty has created a lot of mosques, minarets and 
					religious centres. There is not a single Wilayat in the 
					country without a mosque. One of the greatest and most 
					prominent of these is the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque. I 
					speak like this because I lived both before and during the 
					time of His Majesty. I wish I had not lived except for in 
					the time of His Majesty.<br>
					<br>
					The setting up of Shura and State Councils is one of the 
					hallmarks of his time. His Majesty intends to make use of 
					the potential of the Omani people; therefore he appoints 
					aged people who have retired to State Council in order to 
					utilise their skills for the service of nation and its 
					people and contribute to the Renaissance of the country.<br>
					<br>
					I believe His Majesty could achieve all these things because 
					God has bestowed wisdom on him. It was this wisdom given by 
					the Almighty that served as a secret to fulfill all these 
					achievements. Besides, the commitment of Omani people and 
					their gratitude to God dovetailed nicely with these 
					distinctive divine blessings.<br>
					<br>
					His Majesty achieved in the last forty years what Oman could 
					not achieve in its whole past both in terms of the power of 
					the state and its status and prestige outside. Oman is one 
					of the rare countries in the world which does not have 
					enmity with any other country in the world. Omanis are 
					respected and held in high esteem everywhere.<br>
					<br>
					Owing to the great achievements the country has made, I 
					believe that the country holds out a prosperous and 
					promising future for its coming generations. His Majesty has 
					laid solid foundations for future generations promising them 
					happier life. Moreover, I am confident that Omani people are 
					hard working and will fulfill their ambitions in any way. I 
					am also confident that the future will be bright for us. God 
					will not delay rewarding such great work.<br>

					<b>The private sector has contributed to the development of the 
					country through its partnership with the public sector, says 
					HE Khalil bin Abdullah Al Khonji, Chairman, Oman Chamber of 
					Commerce and Industry</b><br>
					<br>
					During the last 40 years the Sultanate’s economy has made a 
					great leap forward driven by the mechanism of free market, 
					keeping abreast of the innovations of modern age and giving 
					priority to the growth of all economic sectors such as 
					industry, manufacturing tourism, services, information 
					technology etc. Under the wise leadership of His Majesty 
					Sultan Qaboos bin Said the country entered into trade, 
					economic and investment agreement with various economic 
					groups and organisations as well as neighboring countries.
					<br>
					<br>
					HE Khalil Bin Abdullah Al Khonji, Chairman of Oman Chamber 
					of Commerce and Industry (OCCI), attributes the 
					post-Renaissance transformation of Oman to a modern economic 
					powerhouse to inclusive strategies and broad vision with 
					focus on balanced and comprehensive development. “The Omani 
					model of development stands out with its focus on gradual 
					and balanced growth rather than immediate results. This 
					enabled the country to achieve a solid and firm economic 
					base which helped Oman to stand tall through the global 
					economic crisis. Oman was listed among the least affected 
					countries during the financial meltdown,” says HE Khonji.<br>
					<br>
					According to HE Khonji, the hallmark of Oman’s economic 
					growth across all sectors has been stability and balanced 
					fiscal policies. It stimulated commercial and industrial 
					activities in the country and helped attract foreign 
					investments to the country especially in the newly 
					developing zones in Sohar, Duqum, Salalah and other regions.<br>

					<b>Vision 2020</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
					<br>
					HE Khonji observes that Oman’s Vision 2020 was able to take 
					tangible steps to help Oman’s transformation from a 
					traditional economy to a modern one by developing the entire 
					manufacturing and service sectors and increasing their 
					contributions in the GDP through diversifying the national 
					economy. Owing to these measures, the contributions of 
					industry, tourism and service sectors to the GDP have 
					considerably increased. These sectors continue to play an 
					active role in the development of national economy by 
					attracting local and foreign investments and training and 
					employing Omani youths. They have also introduced modern 
					technology and know-how in different areas.<br>
					The year 2010 marks the end of the seventh five-year plan, 
					the third plan within Vision 2020, and the beginning of the 
					Eighth Five-year plan, the fourth within the vision, with 
					several new comprehensive development plans. HE Khonji 
					observes that at this crucial juncture the private sector, 
					as a development partner of the government, is looking 
					forward to playing a bigger and more effective role with 
					special focus on investment in service sectors.<br>

					</font>
					<font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
					<b>Significant contribution</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
					<br>
					HE Khonji says the number of private sector companies has 
					increased more than 70 times during the period from 1975 
					till the end of 2009. This increase reflects the strong 
					contribution of the sector to the economic development. The 
					average contribution of various economic sectors in GDP has 
					amounted to over 63 per cent. HE Khonji also maintains that 
					the private sector plays an important and leading role in 
					drawing investments to the country. “The percentage of 
					investments throughout the five-year plans increased 
					tremendously. The highest of this increase was in the fifth 
					five-year plan (1996-2000) taking the actual investments of 
					the private sector to RO1987mn or 39.7 per cent of total 
					investments. The economic development of the country 
					resulted in the creation of more job opportunities in the 
					private sector. By the end of 2009, the total number of 
					workers increased to 1,235,211 out of which 182,365 were 
					Omanis. Omanisation in some sectors, such as 
					telecommunication and banking, has reached up to 90 per 
					cent,” HE Khonji adds.<br>

					With regards to the future vision of the OCCI, HE Khonji

					the cooperation and partnership between private and public 
					sectors, starting from the upcoming Eighth Five-year plan

					importance should also be given to maintain a balance 
					between economic development and social welfare through 
					promoting science, education and cultural and sports

					in development projects. He also highlights the importance 
					of government’s partnership with the private sector saying 
					that “government is the main guarantor and the largest

					<b>Abdulla Issa Al Rawahy, Chief Strategy Officer, Nawras takes 
					a walk down memory lane to trace the growth of 
					telecommunication industry in Oman from its embryonic stage 
					in 1970s</b><br>
					<br>
					Abdulla Al Rawahy was in Africa in 1970 when his father 
					informed him about His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said coming 
					to throne. His father also told him that the new Sultan 
					invited Omanis outside the Sultanate to return to their 
					homeland. Many people returned to the Sultanate and Rawahi 
					was the first to return among his family members. <br>
					<br>
					“I still remember my flight to the country which cost around 
					RO2,000 in those days and my landing in the mountains at 
					Bait Al Falaj airport in 1972,” he recalls. “Our house was 
					behind the Palace of His Majesty. He used to greet us 
					whenever he went out in military attire in his Land Rover to 
					take stock of the development of the country.”<br>
					<br>
					While many young people went to work in banks, Al Rawahy 
					chose to work in the telecommunications sector at Cable &amp; 
					Wireless, which was the leading telecommunications company 
					in the Sultanate in those days. The day was very simple. He 
					would go to work in the morning and come back at noon for 
					lunch and a nap. In the afternoon, he used to take a stroll 
					on the beach near the British Embassy. By nightfall, he 
					would come back to his house and after dinner listen to the 
					news over the radio and go to bed. “If it was hot and dry we 
					used to sleep inside the rooms, if the weather was humid we 
					used to sleep on the roof of the house,” he recollects.<br>
					<br>
					Rawahi was among the first Omani technicians to get training 
					in Bahrain, then the most progressive GCC countries in 
					communications with a training centre for people of the 
					region. Later, he was sent to the United Kingdom for 
					training and returned in 1975 as a communications technician 
					in Amerat station.<br>
					<br>
					He remembers there were only 500 lines until 1973, and 
					international communication was very difficult and often 
					marred by interference. The only wireless station was the 
					one in Wattayah which was linked wirelessly to Bahrain and 
					from there to the entire world. There were only four 
					international channels operating in high frequency and the 
					contacts depended mainly on weather conditions.<br>
					<br>
					In 1973 and 1974, the coverage was extended to the Al 
					Batinah region and microwave communications were introduced. 
					In 1974, the first satellite ground station was established 
					in Al Wattayah which contributed to improve the quality of 
					communications substantially. In 1975, the government bought 
					Cable &amp; Wireless and began the expansion of 
					telecommunications services to different regions in the 
					Sultanate. In 1975, a satellite ground complex with 
					world-class technology was opened in Amerat.<br>
					<br>
					Asked about the sweet memories of those seemingly hard 
					times, he says, “My salary was not more than RO60. But it 
					was enough for me to send to my father in Africa and to 
					survive till the end of the month. In some remote areas 
					where electricity had not reached, we used solar energy to 
					run phone exchanges and for ventilation.”<br>

					<b>Driven by a philosophy</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
					<br>
					<b>The word renaissance stands for a profound philosophy which 
					cannot be restricted to material development only, according 
					to Sheikh Abdul Malik Al Khalili, Chairman of BankMuscat<br>
					</b>
					<br>
					There is a noticeable difference between renaissance and 
					development. The latter is more material with its signs 
					perceptible everywhere whiles the former stands for a 
					different philosophy. The architect of our Renaissance His 
					Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said has a different philosophy. 
					Renaissance is some thing beyond what we see on the streets, 
					buildings and airports. Historians give different 
					definitions and interpretations to Renaissance. According to 
					me, Renaissance is deeper than building roads, airports and 
					modern buildings, which is part of the development in any 
					country in the world.<br>
					<br>
					Renaissance is the revitalisation of history, heritage, art 
					and relationships. We can hardly find a country in the world 
					other than Oman without an enemy. Oman is everyone’s friend 
					and at the same time it has a strong voice in international 
					forums and on regional issues. <br>
					That is the philosophy of the Renaissance developed by His 
					Majesty. Those who restrict Renaissance to the development 
					are really doing injustice to the concept of Renaissance.<br>
					<br>
					His Majesty will be assessed on par with great leaders in 
					human history. If we restrict the concept of Renaissance to 
					the material development, we are doing a disservice to the 
					concept of the Renaissance as an overall philosophy 
					developed by His Majesty. I often travel to some countries 
					where I can see streets, buildings and facilities which are 
					merely material things. But the symbols of Renaissance in 
					the Sultanate, even if they were not immediately appreciated 
					by a commoner, reflect a deep-seated concept of Renaissance 
					which will be acknowledged by posterity.<br>
					<br>
					Philosophers see a lot of things not seen by the ordinary 
					man. The depth of His Majesty’s philosophy is inaccessible 
					to anybody. His wisdom was the main engine of his philosophy 
					and history alone will be able to talk about that 
					philosophy. The wisdom of His Majesty is well reflected in 
					what he said in his first speech: “‘let bygones be bygones”. 
					That was the beginning of building a solid and sound 
					footing. It is not logical to build Renaissance in a country 
					where any kind of difference or confusion exists.<br>
					<br>
					However there are certain factors that helped in the 
					construction of the Renaissance. The most important of them 
					was the personality of His Majesty which is comprised of 
					several factors such as the experience that has moved to him 
					from his father and grandfather. His education abroad and 
					his extensive travelling added to the elegance and richness 
					of his personality.<br>
					That is why we look into the future of the Renaissance with 
					optimism. <br>

					<b>Vital cog of the economy</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
					<br>
					<b>As the Omani economy is developing, Omantel is a key partner 
					to the country’s large-scale development projects, says Dr 
					Amer Awadh Al Rawas, CEO, Omantel<br>
					</b>
					<br>
					Oman has achieved tremendous milestones over the past 40 
					years. There are many factors that have led to this success 
					– the wise and visionary leadership of His Majesty Sultan 
					Qaboos bin Said, the dedication and commitment of Omanis to 
					undertaking this vision and also embracing international 
					partnerships.<br>
					<br>
					The country’s phenomenal transformation from a traditional 
					society to a modern economic powerhouse has been in line 
					with Omani culture and tradition. “As we modernised, we have 
					maintained our cultural values and traditions, but made sure 
					we used the most advanced technology and knowledge to 
					integrate these traditions into an evolving nation,” says Dr 
					Amer Awadh Al Rawas, CEO, Omantel.<br>
					<br>
					Speaking about the growth of the telecommunications sector, 
					Dr Rawas says the telecom sector has been a driving factor 
					in the country’s infrastructure, from the early days of 
					analogue fixed line systems to the wireless mobile and 
					Internet revolution of the past decade.<br>
					<br>
					“Omantel has aligned itself with the development of the 
					country and the business sector – ensuring that we have the 
					systems and networks in placethat enable businesses to 
					prosper and compete on a regional and international level,” 
					says Dr Rawas.<br>
					<br>
					As the incumbent operator, Omantel has connected the nation 
					– bringing communities together by introducing every major 
					advance in the industry. Omantel has held a major 
					responsibility for ensuring that the state-of-the-art 
					solutions, technology and services have been introduced in 
					the country.<br>
					<br>
					However, perhaps the biggest shift has occurred in the past 
					five years since market deregulation. The end result is a 
					highly competitive dynamic telecom environment with 
					state-of-the-art products and services and improved customer 
					service. For example, Omantel has deployed fibre to the 
					home, and introduced the most extensive 3.5G coverage with 
					more than 750 base stations across the Sultanate.<br>
					<br>
					“Omantel is very proud that it has maintained its leadership 
					position in an increasingly aggressive marketplace. In fact, 
					in 2010 we have enjoyed the fastest growth in the market as 
					demand for the full spectrum of modern telecommunications 
					solutions continues to grow dramatically,” he opines.<br>
					<br>
					According to Dr Rawas, Omantel is fully committed to Vision 
					2020 by continuing to play an integral role in ensuring the 
					long-term economic prosperity of the country. 
					Diversification is already well underway and Omantel is 
					playing an important role in ensuring this will be 
					successful. As the Omani economy is developing, Omantel is a 
					key partner to the country’s large-scale development 
					projects such as Duqm, Sohar and Salalah ports and the major 
					real estate projects. In fact, Omantel has already made 
					significant investments in developing the required 
					infrastructure for these major projects, in order to align 
					with Government initiatives, which reinforces our commitment 
					to realizing the objectives of Vision 2020.<br>
					The key challenges facing the Sultanate as the country moves 
					into the fifth decade of the Renaissance is to build upon 
					the a solid foundation which has been established till date, 
					says Dr Rawas. “The fifth decade of the renaissance will 
					provide opportunities for us to maintain the tremendous 
					momentum generated by the visionary leadership of His 
					Majesty Sultan. We are blessed with a pool of young talent 
					for which we should ensure that they continue to receive the 
					right kind of training and that companies are able to offer 
					rewarding, long-term career development as our new graduates 
					enter the workforce.”<br>
					<br>
					The telecom sector plays an important role in the 
					development of human resources in Oman. And this is revealed 
					in the continuous training and investment initiatives which 
					have ensured that we are developing a highly skilled and 
					technically proficient workforce. In fact, says Dr Rawas, 
					Omantel was among the first telecom operators in the region 
					to have a full-fledged telecom-training centre, which was 
					established in 1978. The training provide by Omantel has 
					helped to deliver expertise that is required and used by 
					other companies and has also contributed to introducing new 
					entrepreneurs to the market. <br>
					<br>
					Omantel is proud that it has trained generations of Omanis 
					who comprise 91 per cent of its employees. The GCC Ministers 
					of Labour Council recognised this achievement in 2007, with 
					the result that Omantel was awarded the “Best Employer of 
					National Workforce” among all telecom companies in the Gulf 
					states.<br>
					<br>
					“As we look ahead to the future, we are committed to 
					supporting the development of the country by aligning our 
					objectives with the overall vision of Oman,” Dr Rawas 
					concludes. <br>

					<br>
					<b>1970 marked the beginning of a new era of human development 
					and economic growth in the country, says Omar bin Ahmed 
					Salim Qatan, CEO of Oman Oil Marketing Company</b><br>
					<br>
					In July 1970, when we heard the good news, we were very 
					happy and praised God like all other Omanis. It was the dawn 
					of the light of hope and the return of security and peace to 
					the country after a period of despair. We were opened to new 
					horizons of knowledge, education and decent life, and the 
					procession of civilisation inched its way forward brining 
					bliss and happiness.<br>
					<br>
					His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said is a unique example of a 
					contemporary leader who led his country to peace and 
					security despite the vagaries of the world around him. He 
					built a modern state and civilised society with the 
					prospects of a bright future. He created cultural awareness 
					among the people and moulded a generation equipped with 
					knowledge and technology capable of creating a dynamic 
					civilisation.<br>
					<br>
					One of the most prominent achievements of the Renaissance 
					was the focus on building the individual, moulding a good 
					citizen who is intelligent, healthy and educated. Schools 
					and hospitals were set up and the horizon of knowledge was 
					expanded.<br>
					<br>
					The modern state of Oman received wider respect and 
					appreciation among the comity of nations. Its political 
					positions, approach to development and its synthesis of 
					traditional values with the growth of modernity were 
					considered exemplary. The ubiquitous presence of Omani 
					citizens in all areas of development is a proof of the 
					success of the comprehensive Renaissance and the 
					reconstruction of Omani citizens. The participation of women 
					in this march along with men was also commendable. Everybody 
					thanked God for providing them with a wise leader who 
					planned, promised and implemented.<br>
					<br>
					Renaissance also provided a fertile ground for human 
					development and commercial growth. Investment and trade 
					development contributed to the development of a great 
					civilisation enjoying safety and security, sustainable 
					development, respect for the law, and a wise and rational 
					leadership. Omani citizens look forward with great dreams 
					and aspirations to grow and to synthesise the past with 
					present and the local with global cross-currents.<br>
					<br>
					The main reason for Oman’s emergence as a modern, civilised, 
					secure, investment- friendly and respected nation is the 
					clarity and steadfastness of the vision of His Majesty 
					Sultan Qaboos bin Said. That policy which served the country 
					and its citizens best was hailed internationally. With this 
					clear vision, the government concentrated on social 
					development and launched five-year plans. There may be more 
					in the future as a result of the vision of the leader and 
					the government’s promising development plans.<br>

					has done was nothing short of a miracle<br>
					</b>
					<br>
					Life was very simple at that time. We were nomads, and there 
					was a lot to do during the day time. Most of the residential 
					areas were located in coastal areas. Especially since we had 
					not seen much about other countries, we did not have great 
					expectations. However, we had good commercial relations with 
					countries as far away as Europe and Australia. <br>
					<br>
					We did not have air conditioners in those days and the 
					temperature was not better than the present time. We used to 
					live near the power transformer in Muscat (near the Diwan of 
					Royal Court at present). During the summer, my four brothers 
					and I slept at night on the roof and our mother would come 
					every two hours to rub us with a wet towel so that we feel a 
					bit cold. But the black dust emitted from the power 
					transformer would fill the area with a layer of black.<br>
					<br>
					There was an Indian School in Muscat with only one classroom 
					for all grades. There was only one bench for each grade. 
					Though there was a secondary school in Muttrah it was very 
					difficult to go there because of the mountainous ways. The 
					main road ended near Bait Al Falaj, while the rest of the 
					city was without streets, and the travel between Muttrah and 
					Seeb depended on the ebb and flow of the tides. People were 
					stranded in one place till the tide ebbed. <br>
					<br>
					When His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said came to power, I was 
					studying in a school in India. I received the news via the 
					phone. Then we did not have great expectations about the new 
					Sultan, and we were not aware of the changes that will occur 
					in the country. All we learned was that Sultan Said was no 
					longer the Sultan of the country, and his son, Sultan Qaboos 
					bin Said, is the new ruler. We did not have great dreams and 
					aspirations for the future. When I returned to Oman after my 
					studies, changes had taken place in various fields, and Oman 
					was going to be united with a road network, the construction 
					of which was underway.<br>
					<br>
					What His Majesty has done was a dream come true for Oman. 
					Those who knew about the past of the country can recognise 
					what His Majesty has achieved for Oman. What he has done was 
					nothing short of a miracle. After His Majesty united the 
					Sultanate, many immigrants started to return to the country 
					to contribute to nation-building. Priority was given to the 
					construction of roads, education and healthcare.<br>
					It was the construction sector which has grown considerably. 
					And until 1985 it was the era of developmental revolution. 
					Trade and commerce have also developed greatly at that time. 
					Before the Renaissance, we were working from morning to 
					evening to earn for our dinner at night.<br>
					Oman is a paradise on earth and is the best place to stay in 
					the world. Ours is an Indian family which enjoyed the 
					privilege of obtaining Omani nationality. I wish the younger 
					and next generation should also enjoy this blessing.<br>

					country. Like all Omanis we were also pleased to hear this 
					great news. From that day onwards, Sultanate came to the 
					forefront of the world.<br>
					<br>
					In 1971, I had the privilege to receive His Majesty at Doha 
					airport. Guided by the words of Imam Ali that health and 
					safety are the two least recognised blessings, His Majesty 
					accorded top priority to health and safety. He set up 
					hospitals and health centres throughout Oman and laid the 
					foundations of internal and external security. As a result 
					of it, Oman developed a well-trained, well-equipped and 
					experienced armed force and set up police stations. This was 
					followed by appropriate regulations and institutions for all 
					segments of Omani society. He also did not lose sight of the 
					tenor of the famous saying ‘Seek knowledge even from China’. 
					He attached great importance to providing education to 
					people in every nuke and cranny of the country.<br>
					<br>
					He also accorded a lot of importance to the development of 
					the agriculture sector and to the religious and spiritual 
					aspects of Omani life. Mosques were set up in all areas. He 
					enacted laws and regulations aimed at the economic 
					development of the country. Omani rial became one of the 
					strongest currencies in the region. Besides, His Majesty set 
					up a securities market. He also took utmost care in the 
					development of Omani industry as an invaluable resource for 
					this country and its people.<br>
					<br>
					With the dawn of the Renaissance, top priority was given to 
					the extraction of oil and discovering more resources. Oman 
					also concentrated on developing extracting mechanisms and 
					technology for this important process. Understanding the 
					great risk involved in this, His Majesty attached top 
					priority to professional health and safety. His Majesty also 
					accorded top priority to the opening of embassies and 
					consulates of the Sultanate in the world and to develop the 
					relations and friendship with these countries. Oman has also 
					signed several agreements on the border with the countries 
					of the region and joined in various international 
					organisations.<br>
					<br>
					As regards tourism, Oman is gifted with a number of 
					beautiful places which attract a large number of tourists. 
					His Majesty set up the Ministry of Tourism for the 
					development of tourism sector in the country. Besides, Oman 
					has a long history and a great heritage and tradition. His

					<b>Coming to Oman in early 1970s, Oman Arab Bank’s CEO Abdul 
					Kader Askalan has witnessed the phenomenal transformation of 
					Oman to an economic powerhouse</b><br>
					<br>
					Abdul Kader Askalan, CEO of Oman Arab Bank, was the manager 
					of the Arab Bank branch in Ras Al Khaimah in the early 1970s 
					when he used to get news about the changes going on in the 
					Sultanate after His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said came to 
					power. People were of the view that Oman needs a long time 
					to become a developed country. After a short while, the 
					general manager of the Arab Bank asked Askalan to move to 
					the bank’s branch in Muscat. Initially, he rejected the idea 
					saying that it was very difficult under the new 
					circumstances. But the manager insisted and said: “Go for 
					three days and if you do not like the situation I will not 
					force you to stay.”<br>
					<br>
					Askalan came to Oman in 1973. Seeb International Airport was 
					very small and did not even have a building. The bank 
					building, which was opened several months ago, was adjacent 
					to the palace in Muscat. When he settled and started to 
					wander in the country, he came to know that prospects are 
					bright for progress in this country with numerous 
					opportunties and very receptive people. He decided to stay 
					in Oman and worked very hard for the development of the 
					bank.<br>
					<br>
					In those days life was not easy. There were no roads, 
					electricity and water; and even food were not available. 
					There was only one bakery where people used to line up in 
					long queues. The road was so small and narrow that if a car 
					got stuck the whole traffic would be in trouble. Askalan was 
					afraid of driving a car at night on roads as there were no 
					electricity or street lights. Despite all these 
					difficulties, he worked hard for the development of the 
					bank. There were only two banks then- British Bank and 
					Charter Bank. He set his goal and worked hard to raise his 
					bank to the level of British Bank.<br>
					<br>
					“The country looked like a workshop. And the development it 
					made has been rapid and great because of the strong desire 
					and willpower of His Majesty and the people around him. We 
					could understand his steely determination to develop the 
					country when we listened to his speeches. We used to 
					participate in the tea parties hosted by His Majesty. From 
					his words we could understand his love and commitment to the 
					country and his strong desire to make Oman a modern 
					country,” says Askalan.<br>
					<br>
					In 1975, due to certain circumstances, the government needed 
					a loan worth $50mn and Askalan worked hard to convince the 
					directors of Arab Bank. That was the OAB’s first big deal 
					with the government and it became one of the banks close to 
					the government. Since then the bank funded a large number of 
					projects. It has become one of the most active banks that 
					funded great development projects. It financed a number of 
					mills and cement factories, Sultan Qaboos ports, water 
					networks and roads in and outside Muscat. In his capacity as 
					the member of the board of directors of the bank, Askalan 
					had also given his advice to the projects which the bank 
					financed.<br>
					<br>
					His first meeting with His Majesty was in 1974. He was 
					accompanying Abdul Majeed Shoman, director general of the 
					Arab Bank. They talked about the objectives of the bank and 
					explained to His Majesty their willingness to provide 
					assistance to the government and participate in the 
					development. He met him again in1975 accompanied by the 
					deputy director of the bank. They were warmly welcomed by 
					him and he expressed satisfaction with the role played by 
					the bank. He met His Majesty again in 1993 when Yasser 
					Arafat visited the Sultanate.<br>
					<br>
					Elaborating on the main factors that contributed to the 
					development of Renaissance, Askalan, who also got Omani 
					nationality in 1995, says, “The most important factors were 
					the wisdom and vision of His Majesty as well as the optimum 
					utilisation of the wealth of the country. Once even the 
					minimum conditions and requirements for life in Oman were 
					not there; but His Majesty with his determination and 
					deriving power from his sincere people established a modern 
					State. Oman has become a modern state in a short period of 
					time.”<br>
					<br>
					He believes that, from the very outset, His Majesty tried to 
					make Omani citizens the objective and purpose of 
					development. “He did everything to make their life happier. 
					He established the rule of law and worked for the 
					development of the economy through diversifying income 
					sources and reducing dependence on oil. His policies also 
					focused on increasing per capita income to reduce the 
					difficulties of life,” he says. <br>
					<br>
					Askalan observes that His Majesty created an open nation 
					which enjoyed good relations with other countries and did 
					not allow anybody to intervene in its internal affairs. “He 
					built a great nation which thrived on safety, security and 
					stability. The stability of the country contributed to 
					attract foreign investment to the country.”<br>
					<br>
					He firmly believes that prospects are bright for Oman in the 
					future, in the light of all these achievements in the 
					country, proper planning and the desire and willpower of His 
					Majesty and his government to maintain its Renaissance 
					development and stability.<br>

					ascendance to the throne, we went into raptures. People were 
					craving for change. We celebrated the occasion rushing to 
					the street with pictures of His Majesty and the flags of the 
					Sultanate. We gathered around the radio, which was not as 
					ubiquitous as today, to hear the speech of His Majesty. Then 
					we rushed to the streets in what seemed to be small 
					disorganised marches. A few people who owned cars drove the 
					streets to express their happiness. Everybody was in need of 
					change. And when His Majesty arrived at the airport, we 
					received him, our faces oozing with rapture and satisfaction 
					over the arrival of the long-expected leader and 
					much-awaited change.<br>
					<br>
					After getting this new, citizens who were living outside of 
					the country returned home in response to a call by His 
					Majesty to contribute to and participate in nation-building. 
					The rest is history with the Sultanate making rapid strides 
					on the path of development and entering into an era of hard 
					work and dedication. The blessed Renaissance led by His 
					Majesty has brought a lot for the Omanis and the country and 
					contributed greatly to gain big achievements. <br>
					<br>
					Since His Majesty took up the reins of power in the country, 
					the country, which has started from scratch, has gone a long 
					way on the path of development and Renaissance by setting up 
					educational and health institutions, providing essential 
					services for the people and freeing people from rigid laws 
					and procedures weighing upon them.<br>
					<br>
					Those who lived at that time can clearly understand the 
					difference and the achievements we gained since then. A lot 
					of services that we enjoy today such as hospitals, schools, 
					roads, ports and airports were not available at that time. 
					Those who lived at that transition period will be aware of 
					what has been achieved on this land in all areas. The 
					Renaissance accorded top priority to the Omani people and 
					their dreams and aspirations. Omani people were the 
					objective and purpose of the Renaissance.<br>
					<br>
					Today Oman has developed in all areas bringing pride for all 
					Omanis as a result of the vision, insight and proper 
					planning of His Majesty. Oman is fast growing in all areas 
					winning laurels from everywhere due to the proper planning 
					and considerable efforts made by His Majesty. His rule has 
					revived the glories of Oman and gained a lot of achievements 
					for which he has been widely commended by all.<br>
					<br>
					Given the great achievements the country has made, prospects 
					are bright for the Sultanate in future. We are optimistic 
					now that the infrastructure facilities will develop more and 
					efforts will be made to reduce the dependence on exhaustible 
					resources and raise the contribution of other sectors such 
					as tourism and attract investments.<br>

					<b>Since 1970, Oman’s civil aviation sector has played an 
					important role in the development of Oman as a country, says 
					Mohammed Mubarak Al Shikely, General Manager, Marketing, 
					Oman Air</b><br>
					<br>
					The history of Oman’s civil aviation sector can be divided 
					into pre and post Oman Air. Up until 2008, both Gulf Air and 
					Oman Air were serving the country, with Gulf Air flying long 
					haul routes into Europe and Asia Pacific, some direct, but 
					mostly through the hubs of the other owner countries of Gulf 
					Air, and Oman Air linking Oman, non-stop with the GCC, 
					Middle East, Africa and the Indian Sub-continent.<br>
					<br>
					Although Gulf Air was jointly owned by four countries, The 
					Oman Civil Aviation Authority (OCAA) played a key factor in 
					Gulf Air operations. The critical technical components that 
					required the highest international Standards, such as flying 
					manuals, pilot and cabin crew licenses and aircraft 
					registration, were entrusted to the OCAA. <br>
					<br>
					Mohammed Mubarak Al Shikely, GM, Marketing, Oman Air, 
					talking about the development of Oman’s civil aviation, 
					informs that this key role extended into many other areas as 
					well, for example, the regular assessments, training and 
					examinations that are required for a country to operate at 
					world standards. This speaks volumes regarding the status 
					that OCAA enjoyed at that time. Continuously evolving, that 
					legacy continues to this day.<br>
					<br>
					In September 2010 Oman Air reached another milestone when it 
					launched its 40th destination, to Kathmandu in Nepal. The 
					launch of the 40th destination is made even more special by 
					the fact that it coincides with the 40th Anniversary of His 
					Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said’s accession to the throne. 
					Oman Air actually started as an airline in 1993 but its 
					roots as a company were established in the civil aviation 
					sector, when Oman International Services (OIS) was set up in 
					1970. Since 1993, the airline has taken rapid strides 
					bringing itself to its present level, where it now boasts 
					world class aircraft and unmatched services.<br>
					<br>
					Oman Air has more than tripled its fleet and destinations 
					since its inception, which is a huge transformation for an 
					airline. If Oman Air is a great international airline today, 
					its success should be traced to the vision of His Majesty, 
					maintains Shikely. Even while Gulf Air was operating in the 
					country, Oman Air was given an opportunity to develop and 
					build its regional and local strengths, so that when the 
					time came for it to move to the next level in becoming an 
					international airline, all the right foundations were in 
					place. That is the greatness of a true visionary.<br>
					<br>
					The directive was given by His Majesty through H.E. Ahmed 
					bin Abdulnabi Macki, (Minister of National Economy and 
					Deputy Chairman of Financial Resources and Energy Resources 
					Council), the chairman of Oman Air, who clearly stated that 
					the goals of Oman Air had to be in line with the economic 
					development aspirations of the country. A management team 
					was put together, selected from local and international pool 
					of talent, to make sure the vision stayed on track and moved 
					ahead.<br>
					<br>
					“I remember H.E. Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki telling us that 
					we are not going to be competing on size, we need to be 
					focusing on the quality of product and service. These are 
					things that you cannot go to a shop and buy off the shelf; 
					they have to be built and developed from scratch. The 
					Chairman and Board of Directors have selected a great 
					management team and the results are there for everyone to 
					see. Take a look at the business class of Oman Air. While 
					other airlines have a six-abreast seating configuration in 
					business class, Oman Air has only four which means that 
					every seat in the business class cabin has an aisle access, 
					meaning you will never have to step over someone and will 
					never be served over someone else,” Shikely says. Further, 
					Oman Air was the first and remained the only airline for a 
					long while worldwide to offer both mobile and internet 
					connectivity aboard its flights. When you look at the giants 
					in the aviation industry, this is an incredible achievement 
					for an airline at such a young age in the evolution process, 
					he adds.<br>
					<br>
					Shikely, who was brought up in England returned to Oman in 
					1980. After working for Gulf Air for a number of years, he 
					joined Oman Aviation in 2001. He says that in 1980 it was 
					hard to imagine how the country would shape in 1990 or 2010. 
					“But today, I can sit with my children and tell them they 
					have a fantastic future. Whether they are boys or girls, 
					whether rich or poor, opportunities abound for everyone, and 
					again, I repeat myself, it is all thanks to the phenomenal 
					vision of His Majesty,” Shikely points out.<br>
					<br>
					According to him, great visionaries like this only come 
					almost once in a lifetime and who, despite the tight turns 
					and sharp bends that the world is taking in terms of 
					security, peace and stability, His Majesty has steered the 
					country through all difficulties with wisdom.<br>
					<br>
					“Perhaps the present generation cannot fully comprehend the 
					development phases and milestones, but I can see that they 
					will have even greater prosperity in terms of opportunities, 
					as long as they have the ability, aspirations and dreams,” 
					he says.<br>
					<br>
					Shikely opines that while the journey has evolved, the 
					tradition, the values and culture of Oman have been 
					retained. It is incredible to live and feel the pathway into 
					the future happening. “To me, as an individual, the balance 
					of tradition and modernity has proven itself and I am sure 
					the same assessment has been made by many different people 
					as well, even beyond their expectations,” he adds.<br>
					<br>
					To conclude, Shikely says that Oman presents a fantastic 
					place for aviation professionals, wherever they come from. 
					And as the government continues to develop the civil 
					aviation infrastructure commensurate with the growth of the 
					economy, the future indeed looks bright.<br>

					<b>Sheikh Ahmed Bin Mohammed Bin Omair, CEO, Bin Omair Group of 
					Companies, examines the factors that contributed to the 
					emergence of Oman as a modern state</b><br>
					<br>
					Great are the achievements brought about by the Renaissance 
					which dawned on the day His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said 
					came to power. This country occupies a great place in our 
					mind. The beauty of Renaissance can be seen reflected on the 
					faces of everybody- from a child who waits the 
					air-conditioned school bus in front of his house in the 
					morning to the government official who drives to office 
					smiling on a spacious road. There is nothing in the country 
					not caressed by its blessings. Women are employed and active 
					in political and economic activities; even the elderly 
					people living in far-off valleys and distant mountains enjoy 
					the fruits of Renaissance.<br>
					<br>
					The transportation from villages to hospitals, schools and 
					cities has become easier. Achievements of the Blessed 
					Renaissance are really uncountable. The most important 
					factor is that Renaissance could unite Oman and make it 
					secure land.<br>
					<br>
					The achievements made by the country are as evident and 
					visible as daylight. The main reasons for these achievements 
					was the blessings that God Almighty bestowed on His Majesty. 
					God has conferred power and wisdom on the great leader of 
					this country and blessed the country with fertile lands that 
					grow only good things.<br>
					<br>
					The second reason was the readiness of Omani people to 
					accept the Renaissance and work in tune with the leader and 
					his government that led Oman to prosperity. For the country, 
					it looked like a rain which was showered on dry lands. 
					People were waiting for the light of the sun which His 
					Majesty raised in the darkness of ignorance. This light 
					could help us alleviate diseases, expel poverty and defeat 
					the armies of oppression and darkness.<br>
					<br>
					I cannot say that people lived a prosperous life before 
					1970. People were leading a pitiful life inheriting 
					humiliation, poverty and vulnerability. The county was at a 
					critical juncture. People were so disappointed that they 
					believed that God will send someone to save the country from 
					its dilapidation. When His Majesty took up the rein of power 
					we knew that its time had come. The first speech he 
					delivered reiterated this belief. He said: “There are 
					changes to come and we will build a modern state.” When His 
					Majesty arrived in Muscat from Salalah a large number of 
					people crowded in the streets to greet him. It was really a 
					bright day for Oman.<br>
					<br>
					What did His Majesty present to the Omani people? It is a 
					small question; but the answer is too long to be described 
					here. He disseminated knowledge and liberated people from 
					ignorance; he eliminated the scourges of poverty and 
					vulnerability which has spread among the people; he united 
					Omani people and made them a single society within a single 
					nation and extinguished the flames of civil wars which had 
					wrought havoc in the country.His Majesty is a unique and 
					exemplary personality and people like him are rare. <br>

					<b>Oman has witnessed tremendous growth in education and health 
					care during the last forty years, says Mohammed Al Rahbi, a 
					retired police officer</b><br>
					<br>
					Before His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said came to power, 
					many services were not available in the country. Diseases 
					were rampant. There were only three schools and one hospital 
					in the country. Life was very difficult at that time. But 
					His Majesty’s coming to power restored the spirit of the 
					country and its people. We started to enjoy the fruits of 
					Renaissance day after day and the ambition for change was 
					great. <br>
					<br>
					I heard about the change of power for the first when I was 
					sitting with my friends. One of them informed us about the 
					coming of His Majesty to power. By that evening the news was 
					confirmed by radio which was then not ubiquitous as now. I 
					was only 12-year old. I still remember the happiness that 
					the news brought to the people who talked about it with 
					great gusto and enthusiasm After a week, we, a group of 
					teenagers, were sitting near Wadi Surur. A military vehicle 
					moved past us. Then a group of military officials came to us 
					and asked us whether we listened to radio or dulcimer. We 
					were frightened and replied in negative because dulcimer was 
					banned in the country before the Renaissance. But they asked 
					us not to fear and to listen to the radio and dulcimer which 
					they said were no longer banned in the country. <br>
					<br>
					Before the Renaissance, there were only three schools in the 
					county-in Muscat, Muttrah and Salalah- though there were a 
					number of Quran learning and memorisation schools across the 
					country. His Majesty said after he took up the reins of 
					power, “We will teach our children even under the tree’. He 
					accorded great priority to education. Schools were set up 
					across the country and people enrolled their children in 
					large numbers. Initially schools were opened in makeshift 
					facilities or under the tree. <br>
					<br>
					Health care was very poor at that time. There were no 
					hospitals or health centres. Diseases were widespread and 
					the mortality rate of the children was high. But today, 
					thanks to His Majesty we are proud of the great progress we 
					made in health care with a lot of high-quality hospitals and 
					health centres across the country.<br>
					<br>
					The great development that happened in the country is one of 
					the wonders of the world. It is not an overstatement. Those 
					who lived before and after the Renaissance can realise the 
					magnitude of the shift and the size of the change in the 
					country. The last 40 years will be etched in golden letters 
					in the history of Oman.<br>
					<br>
					We could not have achieved all this had it not been for a 
					number of crucial factors. The Almighty bestowed on Oman a 
					wise leader who studied the needs of the country and set a 
					goal for the country and its citizens. Oman became a modern 
					state by all means. It is certain that the citizens of the 
					country will continue to contribute their best to help His 
					Majesty fulfill their dreams and aspirations.<br>

					Writers and Literati and President of the Arab-American 
					Dialogue in Washington, examines how the Renaissance gave 
					Omanis a stable homeland and a strong national identity</b><br>
					<br>
					One of the major achievements that the country has made 
					during the Renaissance has been on the security front. In 
					the seventies we had a state of rebellion in the south which 
					the entire country was preoccupied with. There was an urgent 
					need to suppress it and to normalise the security situation 
					in the country so that we could concentrate on development 
					and construction.<br>
					<br>
					Another important achievement was the promotion of social 
					harmony. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said accorded top 
					priority to unite the country because he considered social 
					harmony very important for the development of the country. 
					The roads between towns and villages which linked them to 
					Muscat made communication between people faster.<br>
					<br>
					The third major achievement was the development and the work 
					to build institutions of governance and necessary public 
					utilities such as education, health and social care. Many 
					families need help for their uplift and women also needed 
					support to get equal opportunities in education and work. In 
					education, we concentrated on the creation of skilled cadres 
					who will ensure the continuity of growth in the future. 
					Renaissance provided to the citizens a stable homeland and 
					opportunities for self-fulfillment in the economic and 
					social sector.<br>
					<br>
					Leadership, no doubt, occupies a central role in steering 
					the country ahead. We got a leader who united us and worked 
					for national unity and the integration of the interests of 
					people so that everybody in the society could concentrate on 
					construction and development. The leadership was very open 
					to development and it struck a balanced path and pursued a 
					balanced approach in its foreign relations so that it did 
					not indulge in many things at the expense of the development 
					at home.<br>
					<br>
					I received the news of His Majesty coming to power when I 
					was travelling in Europe with my family. I was working in 
					Kuwait then. It was in the summer when I was on a trip with 
					my family from Kuwait to Europe via road. When we tuned to 
					the radio, we heard the news of His Majesty assuming power 
					in the Sultanate. I told my wife that a major event has 
					happened in the country and its better for us to return to 
					Kuwait. Back in Kuwait, we found the Omani expatriate 
					community in Kuwait was elated and getting ready to return 
					to the motherland. For me it took almost two years to return 
					to the country.<br>
					<br>
					After returning I went to the ministry of foreign affairs in 
					Muscat. Then the ministry did not have various departments. 
					I joined the information department. Then I left for the US 
					in 1973 to work as a counsellor in the embassy in 
					Washington. Later, I was sent to Iran as an ambassador and 
					two years later I was sent to Washington as the ambassador.<br>
					<br>
					I have no doubt that a brighter future is in store for the 
					country. Now we assess the development quantitatively and in 
					the future we will start to measure it qualitatively.<br>

					<br>
					Mustafa Salman, CEO, United Securities was in Kuwait when 
					His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said came to power in 1970. He 
					was very happy to hear the news and found it an auspicious 
					sign of the coming changes. His father took the decision to 
					return to the homeland to contribute to the nation building 
					and respond to the call of His Majesty.<br>
					<br>
					Though they had good investments in Kuwait and their 
					economic condition was stable there, his father decided to 
					return to Oman which was still in a nascent stage. Despite 
					the challenges ahead they decided to come back after selling 
					their investments in Kuwait. Their priority was to return to 
					the country and participate in nation-building. On their 
					arrival in Muscat, they saw that people were happy and 
					optimistic about the change.<br>
					<br>
					“I am very much optimistic about the future. Our great 
					achievements point to the fact that the future will be 
					brighter. We are so dynamic that there is a change or a new 
					development every day. The plans and polices of His Majesty 
					continue to be the catalyst for this change and dynamism,” 
					says Mustafa Salman.<br>
					<br>
					He believes that the blessed Renaissance led by His Majesty 
					was able to make the country a distinct civilised nation. 
					“It could not have achieved what it has achieved had it not 
					been for the concerted efforts of the leadership and people 
					to rebuild their homeland, which was groping through 
					poverty, ignorance and diseases. His Majesty came to save 
					this country and make it a different country in all 
					aspects,” adds Mustafa<br>
					He feels that those who lived both before and after 1970 can 
					understand the evolution and great transformation of Oman 
					under the wise leadership of His Majesty who promised to 
					restore the prestige and history of the country. Development 
					has touched all areas and people of the country. It was a 
					great transformation.<br>
					<br>
					Omanis were hungry for a change since they had suffered a 
					lot in the past. When His Majesty came, people rose and 
					rallied around him offering their support for the 
					construction of Oman. “Today we enjoy a lot of achievements 
					that we made within a short period of 40 years. For all 
					these achievements we owe to God and the vision and insight 
					of a leader,” he says. <br>
					<br>
					The leader inculcated confidence among the people. Omanis 
					worked together as if they were members of a single family 
					and produced tangible results. The leader cultivated a sense 
					of responsibility among people making them work in the 
					spirit of one Oman.<br>
					<br>
					He believes that Renaissance is not merely buildings and 
					roads, but it is a broader concept. Today there are schools 
					and health institutes everywhere and the country became free 
					of pests and diseases because of the attention given by the 
					government to all sectors.<br>
					<br>

					earned international reputation. The vision of His Majesty 
					was proved to be genuine and true,” says Mustafa.<br>

					<br>
					Nailesh K Khimji, Director, Khimji Ramdas attributes the 
					phenomenal transformation of Oman from a traditional society 
					to a modern economic powerhouse to the wise leadership of 
					His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. He believes that Oman’s 
					political and economic policies and structured regulations 
					have been instrumental in bringing about this overall 
					change. They have also helped Oman emerge from the ordeal of 
					the financial crisis unscathed. “Our transformation in the 
					last five years itself has been huge. Now sky is the only 
					limit,” he says.<br>
					<br>
					Referring to the contribution of the retail sector to the 
					development of Oman in the last 40 years, he points to the 
					stellar performance of the sector with its growth in the GDP 
					per capita rising 70 fold. It has risen from $300 in 1970 to 
					over $20,000 in 2010. “During this time, the government 
					spending has increased into the sectors that has0 a trickle 
					down effect on the economy,” he says.<br>
					<br>
					The retail sector plays a big role in reducing the 
					dependence on the government in generating employments. He 
					stresses the importance of job training in retail sector 
					which has a big role in nurturing and harnessing skilled 
					youths. The training will increase the employability of 
					Omani youths, he says.<br>
					<br>
					He considers employability of the youth as one of the key 
					challenges facing the Sultanate when the country moves into 
					the fifth decade of the Renaissance. It is high time the 
					country brought up more of its youth as entrepreneurs. “Even 
					if 15 per cent become successful entrepreneurs, they will 
					help employ the rest of the 85 per cent,” Nailesh suggests.
					<br>
					<br>
					He believes that “Vision 2020” truly reflects Oman’s journey 
					into the third millennium. Faced by diminishing oil reserves 
					and a growing population, the country has very little choice 
					other than diversification of the economy. “The expansion of 
					infrastructure, mainly roads, airports and ports will 
					positively attract tourism and industry and will ensure that 
					our youth is employed and better educated,” observes Nailesh.<br>

					<br>
					A number of modern legislations related to economic,

					They include Trade Act, the Law of Commercial Companies, the 
					Gulf Capital Investment Law, the Law of the foreign capital 
					investment etc.<br>
					<br>
					The judiciary was given full freedom in discharging its

					Decree No. 19 of 1999, established the Administrative 
					Judiciary to adjudicate in administrative disputes, which 
					reflected the vision of our wise leadership regarding the

					</font>
					<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
					<br>
					Considering the importance of a modern and sophisticated 
					trade law, Oman has introduced some amendments to the 
					existing Trade Law with a focus on economic development. It 
					was followed by various other related legislations including 
					the law for regulating the functions of Oman Chamber of 
					Commerce and Industry (OCCI), the law for regulating 
					functions of the banks, the Commercial Companies Laws, 
					electronic transactions law and Capital Market Law.<br>
					<br>
					Considering the growing role of arbitration as an 
					exceptional way of resolving disputes, the Sultanate has 
					developed the law of private arbitration. In this regard, 
					the Sultanate is considered a forerunner amongst other 
					countries that have not an independent arbitration law of 
					its own.<br>
					<br>
					The Arbitration Act of Oman is one of the sophisticated 
					legislations that differ from all other legislations in the 
					Middle East countries because it took into account the 
					principles of the Anosral, which are the rules established 
					by the UN Commission for International Trade Law on 
					International Commercial Arbitration and the principles of

					met by the foreign insurance companies’ agencies and 
					branches operating in the Sultanate of Oman and overseas, 
					says Murtadha M J Ibrahim Al Jamalani, Chartered Insurer-UK, 
					Deputy Chairman of Insurance Committee at Oman Chamber of 
					Commerce &amp; Industry and Member of the Board of Directors, 
					Oman Reinsurance Company.<br>
					<br>
					Al Jamalani is an authority on the insurance sector and is 
					presently working and liaising with the Omani government 
					authorities for developing new insurance products for 
					various sectors of the economy. He had attained the status 
					of being the first GCC citizen to become an Associate of 
					Chartered Insurance Institute of London, UK in the 1980s 
					with intensive advance management training in the Oxford 
					University ‘Templeton College, UK; and at INSEAD, France.
					<br>
					<br>
					In those days, says Al Jamalani, it was mainly marine and 
					fire class of business insurance that were very popular. All 
					imports to the Sultanate were on the CIF basis i.e. cost, 
					insurance and freight. And it was only the branches of 
					foreign insurance companies and agencies that were operating 
					in the Sultanate. The first national insurance company, Oman 
					National Insurance Company, was established as a partnership 
					between the Omani private sector and the government of Oman 
					in the in the year 1978, informs Al Jamalani.<br>
					<br>
					The government also introduced compulsory cession i.e. it 
					was made mandatory for foreign insurance companies to 
					reinsure 15 per cent of each and every business with Oman 
					National Insurance Company until the formation of the 
					national reinsurance company in Oman.<br>
					<br>
					In late 1980s and early 90s, most of the stated above 
					foreign insurance branches and agencies either closed down 
					or merged or were taken over by national insurance 
					companies. Some of the companies apart from Oman National 
					Insurance Company, which came into being, were Oman United 
					Insurance Company, Al Ahlia Insurance Company and Dhofar 
					Insurance Company. The last three named companies, today, 
					between them have the lion’s share of the underwriting 
					business in the country. According to Al Jamalani, a major 
					development which happened in 1983 was introduction 
					compulsory motor insurance incorporated in the traffic law.

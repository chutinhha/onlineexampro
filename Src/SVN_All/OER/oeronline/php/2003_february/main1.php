                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><img border="0" src="bank1_final.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" height="331">The high level of personal borrowings among Omani households has been a subject of deep concern for many of us. Quite often, factors affecting the rate of savings within the country have been
                    analysed, and corrective measures, especially in the form of national educational campaign have been taken by the government to encourage savings among its people. The Central Bank of Oman
                    (CBO), through one of its publications, even floated a query - Are we living beyond our means? The CBO asserted that people's saving habits are poor and called for the creation of a savings culture within the
                    country.<br>
                    OER took to the streets to find out just how Omanis think and behave when it comes to savings. Our research team interviewed 100 Omanis face-to-face in and around Muscat, polling an equal number of men and women. The results tell an interesting
                    tale.</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Attitude and behaviour</b><br>
              We start with a resounding 'yes' to savings from our survey respondents and find out that a majority of respondents are inclined towards savings in one way or the other.&nbsp;<br>
 Of the total respondents, 98 per cent agreed that saving is necessary, 48 per cent disagreed that saving is something you should do only if you have enough money, and 85 per cent opined that they would rather save for the future rather than spend today. Fifty eight per cent said they save and 38 per cent said they do not. The research also found out that men are more likely to save than, with 62 per cent and 54 per cent respectively saying they
              save.<br>
              Huda Al Khodori says, "You need to have appropriate budget for expenditure in order to save." Amaal Al Rawahi typified the response of the majority and said,
              "Saving is necessary to do even if you don't have much money. You can do this by just buying those things that are
              'really' needed."<br>
              Those who are saving do so from a position where their income is greater than their regular monthly expenditure, and 62 per cent of Omanis interviewed confirmed this trend. Men tended to earn more than
              women.<br>
              Age was also identified as a factor for higher income. Abdul Razaq Mohammed, 40, a legal researcher at the Public Authority for Social Insurance, has 11 people in his household but said - I save a small amount each month since my salary is greater than my monthly outlay. Also, most of those who do not save do not do so for a shortage of money. Mohammed Al Balushi is retired from the Royal Oman Police (ROP) but works as a public relations officer (PRO) in a firm of engineering consultants.
              "My salary is less than my monthly expenditure. I have a large household of 16 people." When asked how he managed, he replied,
              "The ROP gives me a pension that helps to meet my monthly costs."&nbsp;<br>
 A counter poll of expatriates residing in Oman showed a higher proportion of savings. And more of them are saving larger amounts per month, with just over 50 per cent of expatriate respondents managing to save more than RO100 per
              month.<br>
              <b><img border="1" src="saving-survey.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="226">What people save
              for?</b><br>
              Our research highlights that owning a car is a priority for men and women. Cars are the single-most popular item for which people save. Twenty eight per cent of those saving among the respondents said they were saving to buy a car. The next most popular things people save for are a house, marriage and then travel."<br>
              I am saving each month to buy a car," affirmed Zakiya Khalfan, a saleswomen working in a store at Al Araimi
              Centre. "At the moment I use taxis or ask my friends for a lift to get to work, which is sometimes difficult.  Having my own car would make things easier."&nbsp;<br>
              <b> What people save in?</b><br>
              The banking sector stands as the main recipient of Omanis' savings with 27 per cent of all Omanis surveyed saving in bank accounts (Table 2). The CBO data shows there were about 624,000 deposit accounts with commercial banks in March 2002, averaging a balance of RO1,328 in each account. With a total population of 2.4 million in mid-2000 and the fact that at least 40,000 deposit accounts may belong to companies, roughly 25 per cent of the population does save, and people do have an individual accounts. This estimate, however, does not allow for people having several
              accounts.<br>
              The main reason people gave for selecting to save in a bank was, at first the banks are safe, and second their salaries are directly paid into a bank account. The prize draws, surprisingly, are less of an incentive for people choosing to save in a bank account, with only ten per cent of those citing it as a primary motive. A similar proportion cited interest earnings for saving with a
              bank.<br>
              Another instrument that attracts local savings is a (informal) scheme called Jamaiya. OER featured the rise of the Jamaiya last year, showing that 26 per cent of Omanis are saving in this scheme. Jamaiya can be viewed as a savings instrument up until the time when a person receives the block payment, after which it becomes a borrowing
              vehicle.<br>
              Some see the banks and the Jamaiya as competitors; others as complementary products serving different needs. Mohammed Al Murshoodi participates in three Jamaiya, two lasting for two years each and the third lasting five years. He said,
              "I prefer to save each month in a Jamaiya. But I do save money in a bank because I can access it more quickly."<br>
              People saving in a Jamaiya, do not agree with the riba-based banking system (70 per cent of those saving in this scheme). Salim Al Sawafi prefers to save his money at home where it is safe. He said,
              "I don't save much money and if I put it in a bank I would have to pay bank charges. I don't have enough savings to qualify for free banking and I feel it is just as safe at home as in a bank."  Around ten per cent of the survey respondents do the same, and 73 per cent of them said they do so because it is
              safe.<br>
              Investing in shares on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) or in a property is not a popular practice. Around five per cent of the respondents in the survey made such investments.&nbsp;<br>
              <b> Incentives for savings<br>
              </b>As per CBO, 58 per cent of Omanis save and 27 per cent of them do so through the commercial banks. In Oman, the two instruments adopted by the banks for attracting savings are offering interest or entering account holder in prize draws. Of the 624,000 deposit accounts with banks in March 2002, 77 per cent are receiving no interest according to CBO. Ninety six per cent of the respondents with bank accounts said they received no interest. Many have savings in accounts that do not pay interest, while others chose not to avail any
              interest.<br>
              However, around 21 per cent of Omanis in the survey, said they thought the best way for the banks to encourage more savings was through offering interest, while 31 per cent of respondents believe in prize draws.&nbsp;<br>
 Also, it is difficult to determine as to how effective these schemes are in attracting savings. Almost 80 per cent of Omanis interviewed do not take part in the bank prize draws, and only 17 per cent said they do. By contrast, more expatriates participate in prize draws. Of the expatriates interviewed, 45 per cent said they opened up an account because of the added
              incentives.<br>
              Fifty four per cent of the Omani respondents said they have or would have opened a bank account without the incentives, and around 20 per cent said the reverse. Even fewer said they had accounts with several banks just to enter the prize schemes. However, around 31 per cent of the respondents think the selection of winners to the draws is neither fair nor open, and 29 per cent are fine with the system.&nbsp;<br>
 In the end, there is more saving going on among Omanis than one is lead to believe. Banks are the main recipients of Omanis' savings although Jamaiya are taking a large proportion too. There is room for the savings market in Oman to grow yet it is not clear that the prize draws are the most effective way to encourage this. And besides interest rates, innovative alternatives could succeed in increasing the savings rate in the country.</font></p>

                        <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"> In line with the global trend, domestic money supply continued to increase. Easy money conditions had its scaling down impact on money market, deposit and lending interest rates. Commercial bank deposits expanded as compared to credit. Owing to gradual fall in interest rates, demand deposits showed greater expansion trend as compared to time deposits, underlying the preference of the depositors to stay at the lower end of the duration looking for signs of stabilisation and firming up of interest rates. The generally stable personal loan interest rate also was impacted by easy money conditions, with the rate falling to around nine per cent in the case of selective customers from the ceiling of 12 per
                        cent.<br>
                        The drive against money laundering was made further stringent with the introduction of The Money Laundering Law in April 2002. Similarly the practice of corporate governance in banks was further strengthened with the CBO laying down broad, clear-cut principles of demarcation between the role, responsibility and accountability of the board of directors and that of the management in
                        banks.<br>
                        Also, number of banks expanded and upgraded their electronic banking services by providing tele and Internet banking solutions to the customers. Utility bill payment service through ATMs covered more banks. ATMs of the various banks were inter- linked with the provision of Oman switch service. Few more banks became members of the Muscat Securities Market and offered brokerage services to their customers. The primary market was showing signs of revival with the number of issues lead managed by the banks increased during the year. The year began with the merger of Industrial Bank of Oman with BankMuscat and the year ended with the merger of Majan International Bank and Bank

                        With improved asset quality, growth in business and favourable interest rate conditions, banking sector as a whole is expected to report good results for
                        2002.</font></p>

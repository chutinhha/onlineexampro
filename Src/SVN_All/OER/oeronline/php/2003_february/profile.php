After meeting Salem Al-Ghattami, chances are that you, too, will find that he is affable and likeable. He has a reputation as a go-getter who thrives on results and hard work. Therefore it comes as little surprise to learn that he is carrying out civil duties in the Majlis Al Shura while managing his own successful architectural firm. He is easy to talk although he senses that his friendly nature is, at times, a bad habit. "I try to be nice to everybody," he concedes reluctant to admit flaws. Then he smiles wryly admitting that his emotions are not easily contained. Salem mostly wears his heart on his sleeve which is a reason why many warm to his persona.&nbsp;<br>
 His professional career kicked off in 1981 when he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in the US. While many of his peers with similar qualifications specialised in petrochemical engineering, Salem decided to venture into property design after a short spell at Petroleum Development Oman. He established his own business, Jabrin Engineering Consultancy Bureau in 1983. Sometime later, he was appointed the Director-General of Town Planning in the Ministry of Housing but in 1997 he chose to leave his government post and focus on building up his property consultancy. But it was not long before Salem would return to public office.&nbsp;<br>

 Elections to the Fourth term (2001 to 2003) of Oman's consultative assembly - the Majlis Al Shura - held in September 2000 saw a large turnout. As many as 114,567 people cast their votes at polling stations in the regions representing 81.8 per cent of the total number of voters who acquired election cards although the rate reached 98 per cent in some regions. Some 540 nominees representing 59 Wilayats contested the elections for 83 seats in the Majlis. Salem won from his home province, the Wilayat of Nakhal and currently chairs the Majlis' Economy Committee.&nbsp;<br>
 He says, "Of course I'm happy that my community voted for me to represent them. The Majlis is a very important place that affects them and the national economy directly." He knows that the majority of the 16,000 people in his constituency are depending upon him to deliver tangible results and promote the concerns of his Wilayat.&nbsp;<br>
 "There is always coordination between myself and the Wali of Nakhal. He is the main coordinator on government issues but on occasions we both need to get involved to get across particular views on the services and infrastructure that are needed."&nbsp;<br>
                    Nakhal, best known for its restored fort and its lush spring of A'Thorwarah, lies sandwiched between the Batinah Coast and the Western Hajar Mountains. About 110 km from Muscat, the area is remote and infrastructure improvements are a priority for the local community.<br>
                    Recently, the Wilayat was granted a project to bring it closer to neighbouring town Fanja. The government is helping to cut a route through the mountains to bring these two communities closer, a move that should ensure that the journey between them is dramatically cut to only 15 km from 130 km. This award was not initially in the Five-Year Plan, emphasises Salem but the government showed its willingness to be flexible in bringing more priority to such an investment project. It follows upgrades in roads, schooling and medical provision that have also assisted the neighbourhood and other nearby districts.&nbsp;<br>
 The role of the Majlis Al Shura is to review all draft economic and social legislation, as prepared by the various Ministries and as laid down in the Five Year Plans as well as put forward proposals and monitor their execution within the framework of the State's general strategy.&nbsp;<br>
 For Salem, the manner in which power has being handed to the local communities has been very wise. "Oman has made remarkable progress. Step-by-step democracy has been the key to its
                    success,&quot; he says.<br>
                    There is still uncertainty as to the number of local people that interact with their local Majlis Al Shura representatives and how many put forward complaints for them to follow up. One local says, "This area needs improvement on the part of the public. There needs to be greater participation by them in the affairs of the country through the proper channel."&nbsp;<br>
 The Shura in the Sultanate is continuously developing and changes are being considered in upgrading that process. The Majlis' Fifth term (2004 to 2006) may open the door to free direct elections in which all citizens aged 21 and above will have the right to vote. Though he has not ruled out standing for election again on October 2, 2003, Salem hints that he may consider it as membership of the Majlis has given him immense job satisfaction and he has more to contribute driven by the necessity for creating more jobs in the country. He says the main issues that the government is discussing with members of the Majlis are to do with the economy and job creation while the Economy Committee also checks that services are distributed fairly and evenly throughout the country.
                    <b> Building success&nbsp;</b><br>
 To focus only on his role in the Majlis would be missing another significant aspect where Salem fulfils the needs of the community. As the American James Stockinger wrote, society depends on the hands of others. It is the hands of others who grow the food we eat, sew the clothes we wear, and build the homes we inhabit.&nbsp;<br>
 As Executive President of homebuilder Jabrin Engineering Consultancy Bureau, Salem plays another active role in Muscat's business community. Its latest flagship project is a residential and commercial complex opposite Radisson SAS which cost an estimated RO1.5 million (US$3.9 million) to build. The company, a Grade-I consultancy, has completed the design and supervision on many civil building projects including schools and colleges as well as factories, villas and multi-storey commercial properties.&nbsp;<br>
 "Real estate is a risky business. The income it can generate may not be as high as other industries such as manufacturing or other service sector operations. The market has been flat of late but activity overall in the construction industry is usually high," he maintains.&nbsp;<br>
 Our main job is to design and supervise for others and so we become entrusted as a partner in most projects. We take great care in their development, says Salem who then explains why he takes so much pride in his work. "Most people working in the country are aiding the development of Oman but I'm lucky enough to be working in a profession where the results of my work serve as reminders of this on the landscape."&nbsp;</font></p>

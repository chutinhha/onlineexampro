              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Re-launched recently with a completely new look, Traveljini is an exhaustive website offering travel services worldwide.

And don't worry if you don't get your best rate on the site. You can always post your query over e-mail to their flight service officers, who will workout the best deals for you. In short, the company is full-fledged travel online agency, and one of its service includes delivery of ticket, insurance and even foreign exchange at your doorstep.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Digital provides an international online community for businesswomen around the world. Although the website is a platform for creating and linking your own business website, the site contains useful free business resources and tools including information about home business ideas and free marketing and sales tips on how to become your own entrepreneur. For example, there is a well-researched section on how to write a mission statement and there are the latest reviews on books dedicated to women in business. Founded in 1998 by Texan graphic artist Rebecca Game, the site claims to have over 15,000 international members to whom it refers as 'women with their modems running'. Some may find the site too US-centric but mostly it makes interesting reading.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Airline Equality is an interesting site for those of you who travel on aeroplanes regularly or once in a blue moon. Put together by a UK company that specialises in auditing service standards on airlines, there's lots of information to digest from surveys on in-flight entertainment to safety, seating and cuisine. If you want to know which airlines score five stars or supply the highest quality performance in the minds of passengers, you can check the rankings section. We were relieved to see that no airline scored as low as one star but they don't do all airlines. Once you've decided which carriers you prefer, you can check out what's being debated in the opinion pages to find out why, in the worlds' largest airport passenger survey last year, Hong Kong International Airport received top honours. There's even a health section which gives the low-down on deep vein thrombosis and what you can do to minimise the risk of developing it while flying.</font></p>

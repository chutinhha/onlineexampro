<br>
<img border="0" src="gcc_dairy1.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="229">Central 
banks of various Middle Eastern countries are seriously mulling over 
diversifying their foreign exchange reserves from US Dollar to Euro. Mixed 
opinions were expressed by the Middle Eastern central banks on the issue. While 
the UAE and Qatar, followed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are seriously 
considering shifting reserves from US Dollar to Euro, Bahrain and Oman are still 
keeping faith on US Dollar, but are open to shift. However, the central banks 
will take the final decision on the issue soon.<br>
<br>
All the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have pegged their currencies to 
the US Dollar. The Gulf central banks are increasingly toying with the idea of 
hiking the share of Euro in their reserves, thanks to the major gains made by 
the Euro in the recent months and the overall negative long-term outlook of the 
US Dollar. All the Gulf countries hold over 70 per cent of their reserves in US 
Dollars. The six Gulf central banks together hold more than US$ 250 billion in 
reserves.<br>
<br>
The United Arab Emirates has already announced its intent to augment the portion 
of its forex reserves held in Euro-denominated assets from 2 per cent to 10 per 
cent. The head of the UAE central bank, Sultan Nasser Al Suweidi, said the bank 
was mulling over converting 10 per cent of its reserves from US Dollars to 
Euros. Critics say the UAE’s decision is a reaction to the Dubai Ports fiasco. 
However, UAE officials have repeatedly clarified their stand and said if they 
move out of US Dollar, it will be because of market dynamics rather than because 
of politics. Such a move would reduce the risk that its central bank would incur 
should the US Dollar weaken sharply.<br>
<br>
In response to the market volatility, it is learnt that Saudi Arabia too is 
considering not, to depend solely on the US Dollar. At a gathering of central 
bankers held recently in the UAE, the Saudi central bank governor said stability 
was a priority in his policy on asset holdings. Other central bankers said they 
were looking at diversifying reserves estimated at around US$ 50 billion. It is 
reported that already, over the past couple of years, most members of OPEC have 
slashed the proportion of deposits held in US Dollars from 75 per cent to 61.5 
per cent.<br>
<br>
“The return on the US Dollar is higher than on other currencies. It makes sense 
to be invested in the US Dollar as long as the (currency) peg is there,” said 
Hamood Sangour Al Zadjali, Executive President of Oman’s central bank, which 
keeps 70 per cent of its reserves in US Dollars and the rest in other 
currencies.<br>
<br>
Expressing similar sentiments, Rasheed Al Maraj, Governor of the Bahrain 
Monetary Agency, said: “We are heavily invested in US Dollar-based assets, and 
that is our position. We are maintaining (that) same policy.” Qatar’s central 
bank Governor said that the bank could hold up to 40 per cent of its foreign 
exchange reserves in Euros.<br>
<br>
Commenting on the Gulf countries’ concern over switching forex reserves holding 
from US Dollar to Euro, Ashraf Laidi, Chief Currency Strategist at MG Financial 
in New York said, “the fact that these Gulf nations are major producers of the 
world’s most important commodity (oil), which happens to be priced in US Dollar, 
the mere consideration to carry more Euros should help the Euro against the US 
Dollar.”<br>
<br>
Analysts feel that although the forex reserves held by the Gulf countries are 
modest compared to other countries such as China, Singapore and others, the 
decision to shift reserves will have direct impact on the other country’s policy 
decision and increase pressure on the US Dollar. <br>
<br>
The US Dollar has already started showing depreciation against most major 
currencies, including Euro, British pound, Japanese Yen, Swiss Francs, Canadian 
Dollar etc in the first week of April. According to a Dow Jones Newswires survey 
of 20 leading foreign exchange dealers, the US Dollar was seen ending the year 
considerably lower versus the Euro and the Yen.

Despite strong financial position, GDP growth rate is expected to slow down in 
Kuwait unless the pace of structural reforms accelerates, says an International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) report. Although the overall fiscal position is projected to 
remain in a comfortable surplus over the medium term, the report suggests Kuwait 
to consider improvements in the structure of the budget by gradually increasing 
capital expenditure, rationalising transfers and subsidies, and achieving a 
better balance between productive expenditure and fiscal saving. IMF directors 
noted that efficient management of the rapidly growing public sector savings 
would be the key to Kuwait’s long-term fiscal viability.<br>
Overall, Kuwait registered a strong macroeconomic performance during 2004 and 
2005. Real GDP expanded at an average rate of 7.5 per cent, thanks to higher oil 
production and buoyant non-oil activity (6.4 per cent). Per capita GDP increased 
by 43 per cent to more than US$26,000 during the two-year period through 2005. 
Inflation remained low at 1.3 per cent in 2004, although it rose to almost 4 per 
cent in 2005, due to rising non-oil activity, abundant liquidity, and the 
delayed effect of the depreciation of the Dinar against the Euro and Yen.<br>
<br>
On the fiscal front too Kuwait showed improvement. The overall fiscal surplus — 
estimated at 24 per cent of GDP in 2004-05 and a saving rate of 28 per cent of 
GDP in 2004-05 — was the highest among all GCC countries. The “external current 
account” annual surplus averaged around US$ 25 billion (35 per cent of the GDP), 
says the IMF report. At an annualized rate, exports of oil and oil products 
increased by over 47 per cent, but non-oil export growth slowed down to 15 per 
cent compared with a surge of about 70 per cent in 2003, because of slower 
growth of re-exports to Iraq.<br>
<br>
However, IMF cautioned the authorities over the expenditure pressures, which are 
already evident in the area of wage and salary increases and higher subsidies 
and transfers. In the absence of a clear strategy for utilising the surpluses, 
pressures would intensify for higher salary increases, a larger size of the 
government, and larger transfers to Kuwaiti nationals, the IMF directors opine. 
While supporting the authorities’ plan to build up Reserve Fund for Future 
Generations, IMF has recommended that there be a “Value Added Tax” to increase 
non-oil revenues as some GCC countries have done.<br>
<br>
While welcoming the steps taken to further strengthen banking supervision and 
open further the sector for foreign banks, IMF recommends, an expeditious 
drafting and passing of the capital market and insurance laws; and establishing 
the capital market and insurance authorities to ensure comprehensive oversight 
of the stock exchange, investment companies, and the insurance sector. To 
further promote private sector participation, IMF has urged the authorities, to 
apply the Kuwaitization policy with flexibility, so that the competitiveness and 
profitability of the private sector are not adversely affected.

Saudi Arabian banks have shown impressive performance in 2005. Net profits of 
the banks posted a record increase of about 60 per cent, totaling US$ 100.87 
billion in 2005. At least nine banks profits exceeded US$ 3.75 billion. Overall 
the banks registered an annual growth ranging between 36.5 and 40 per cent.<br>
<br>
<img border="1" src="profit_chart.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="208">The 
banks that showed considerable growth profits are Al Rajhi Bank, which topped 
with US$ 21 billion, an increase of 92 per cent over the preceding year. This 
represents 21 per cent of the total net profit of the banking sector, followed 
by National Commercial Bank (NCB) with 18 per cent profit, and Samba with 15 per 
cent of the total profit. The combined net profit of Al Rajhi, NCB and Samba 
makes up 54 per cent of the total.<br>
<br>
Individual performance of the banks are as follows: NCB profits rose by 41.9 per 
cent reaching US$ 18.75 billion; Samba’s net profit rose 60 per cent to over US$ 
15 billion; Riyad Bank, which comes fourth with 13 per cent of the total net 
profit registered 41.5 per cent increase with US$ 10.5 billion; and SABB (Saudi 
British Bank) and Saudi Fransy Bank hold fifth and sixth positions with US$ 
9.375 billion and US$ 8.25 billion (52 and 44 per cent) respectively. <br>
<br>
Arab National Bank holds seventh position with US$ 6.825 billion, an increase of 
56.6 per cent, followed by Saudi Investment Bank and Saudi Hollandi Bank with 
US$ 3.975 billion and US$ 3.93 billion (3.95 and 3.9 per cent of the total 
banking net profit) respectively.

Growth in the manufacturing sector in the UAE hardly gets noticed as tourism and 
construction activities hog limelight. However, this sector is doing fairly 
well. According to the Ministry of Finance and Industry, investment in the UAE’s 
manufacturing sector rose to US$ 250.49 billion last year. In 2005 alone, 
investment was US$ 19.466 billion, up 8.4 per cent over the previous year, At 
19.2 per cent, manufacturing is the second largest contributor to the UAE’s GDP. 
Year 2004 saw investment in the manufacturing sector grow by over 44 per cent 
from US$ 160.1 in 2003 to US$ 231.13 billion in 2004.<br>
<br>
The largest sector in terms of investment within the manufacturing industry is 
the food and beverage sector with 299 industries accounting for the lion’s share 
of the investment with US$ 114.50 billion or 45.8 per cent of the total 
investment since the Federation was established in 1971, followed by US$ 55.05 
billion or 22 per cent in chemical products. The food and beverages sector 
recorded 200 per cent increase in its investments in 2004 over 2003. <br>
<br>
Even with the highest number of manufacturing units, metal and machinery sector 
(858 units) followed by chemical products (589) failed to attract huge 
investments. Same is the case with lumber and furniture sectors, that attracted 
the lowest investment, just US$ 734 million. But the same sector registered 
highest maximum growth in 2004 over 2003 with a 15.3 per cent growth in 
employment, followed by non-metallic mineral products with a 13.8 per cent 
growth, and food and beverages 10.9 per cent</font></p>

The financial services industry is creating more employment opportunities for 
the Bahrainis. The industry is dominated by the nationals who hold about 70 per 
cent of the jobs in the financial institutions in the Kingdom. The total number 
of nationals employed is up from 5,581 to 5,951, a 6.6 per cent rise, according 
to a survey carried out by the Bahrain Monetary Agency’s (BMA) Financial 
Stability Directorate.<br>
<br>
Significantly, employment in Bahrain’s financial services industry grew by 9 per 
cent last year to a total workforce of 8,219 people, up from 7,542 a year 
before. Also, the number of Bahraini women working in the commercial banks 
increased by 19.7 per cent. According to the BMA survey, employment in Bahrain’s 
banking sector grew by 10.6 per cent and the total Bahraini workforce grew by 
7.6 per cent, which represented 75.5 per cent of the total workforce in this 
sector. Of the Bahraini personnel, nearly one-third are women while the 
remaining are men. Interestingly, the Bahrainis form 87.1 per cent of the total 
commercial banks workforce, 61.9 per cent of offshore banking units employers, 
while 69.4 per cent of the investment banks employers are Bahrainis.— Sowmya Sri Rallabhandi</font></p>

A highly insightful and slightly controversial report on Qatar’s labour market 
has been released, and the country’s Planning Council is trying to garner 
support to implement its recommendations. The World Bank authors of this recent 
report, commissioned by the Planning Council, warn that major deficiencies in 
the workforce deployment system, particularly public education, must be 
addressed.<br>
<br>
Globally, unemployment is on the rise, but in Qatar, the demand for jobs far 
outweighs the supply. It is estimated that the demand for jobs in the country 
will increase by thousands every year, and the country’s biggest challenge will 
be in meeting this need. The Council invited some of the world’s top experts to 
study the local labour market. The World Bank’s analysis was blunt:<br>
• The Qatari labour force is neither large enough nor suitably qualified to 
sustain the size and specialized nature of the economy that is generated by the 
oil and gas sector<br>
• The deployment of the Qatari labour force is further constrained by an 
eight-fold segmentation and by poor outcome of the workforce deployment system, 
especially with respect to the education of Qatari men<br>
• The ability of the labour and education authorities to coordinate within and 
between themselves, and to jointly guide the development of the workforce, is 
hampered by policy, organizational and administrative impediments and 
statistical inadequacies.<br>
<br>
The Qatari population, the report claims, is not large enough to support the 
economy shaped by the oil and energy sectors. Between 1997 and 2004, the annual 
population growth rate of Qataris has been 2.2 per cent compared to 6.5 per cent 
for non-Qataris. There is a large male deficit in education that prohibits 
Qataris from deservedly replacing non-Qataris. For example, the enrolment rates 
of Qatari men in secondary education are already lower than those of women; the 
examination pass rates and progression rates from one education level to another 
is also lower than men; there are nearly three female university students for 
each male student at Qatar University; by age 25, Qatari males have already lost 
nearly 6,000 education years compared to Qatari females; and there are (in 2004) 
nearly 1,200 fewer Qatari male workers with university education than Qatari 
women.—Vani Saraswati</font></p>

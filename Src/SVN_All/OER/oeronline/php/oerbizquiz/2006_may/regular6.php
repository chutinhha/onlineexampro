                <b>Hundreds lose jobs in DP World port takeover<br>
                </b><br>
                <img border="1" src="worldscan_2.jpg" align="right" width="121" height="112">Nearly 
                800 employees of Mina Zayed, including 270 UAE nationals, have 
                been fired following a management takeover by Dubai Ports World, 
                according to recent media reports.<br>
                DP World, the world’s third largest port operator, took over the 
                management of Mina Zayed on April 1, its second major 
                acquisition in the UAE following the takeover of Fujairah port 
                last year.<br>
                <br>
                “On April 12 approximately 800 employees received their 
                termination letters,” a top Mina Zayed official, who was moved 
                out said, as per media reports.<br>
                <br>
                “Many senior people have been replaced including the 
                under-secretary and assistant under-secretary and some have 
                resigned from their posts,” the ex-official was quoted to have 
                said.<br>
                <br>
                Ahmad Al Calily, managing director of Abu Dhabi Ports Company, 
                the new entity created to oversee development of the emirate’s 
                port infrastructure, confirmed, as per media reports, that 270 
                nationals and about 300 expatriate workers will no longer be 
                employed at Mina Zayed under a restructuring plan. But he 
                insisted that all UAE nationals and some expatriates would be 
                absorbed in other government jobs.<br>
                <br>
                Al Calily said the move followed an evaluation of personnel by a 
                committee comprising members of the old and new management, 
                including DP World consultants. <br>
                <br>
                But DP World distanced itself from the job cuts. “We are only 
                responsible for managing the port. It is not a concession 
                agreement,” DP World’s deputy managing director Anwar Wajdi was 
                quoted to have said.</font></p>

                You can now browse and search the net on your laptop computers 
                and hand-held devices--without an Internet connection, say media 
                reports.<br>
                <br>
                A brand new software developed by a Silicon Valley startup, 
                co-founded by Indian tech star Rakesh Mathur, makes that 
                possible. What more, the service comes free.<br>
                <br>
                Webaroo, the venture floated by Mathur along with fellow 
                computer hotshots Bradley Husick and Beerud Sheth, formally 
                launched the `Searchable, Offline Web’.<br>
                <br>
                “At home or on the go, in the air or on vacation, users can now 
                find the information they need, wherever they are,” said 
                Webaroo’s CEO Mathur, who made a fortune during the dotcom boom 
                by selling his hugely successful junglee.com to Amazon.<br>
                <br>
                The Indian face of Webaroo is not restricted to Mathur and Sheth, 
                both from IIT Mumbai. Much of the work on the new software has 
                been done by 50 odd software developers and mathematicians in 
                India. The company has offices in Seattle, Santa Clara, Mumbai 
                and Delhi.<br>
                <br>
                The Webaroo software features “web packs” on a variety of 
                subjects such as news, sports and major global cities.</font></p>

                <img border="1" src="worldscan_1.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="121">Barbie 
                is at war. The iconic blonde doll has dumped one Hollywood 
                studio in favour of another that promises more exposure in her 
                ongoing battle to beat back the Bratz — bigheaded, pouty-lipped 
                dolls with street-wise fashion sense. The doll wars have been 
                costly for Barbie’s maker, Mattel, which in January posted a 
                lower quarterly profit partly due to an 11 per cent decline in 
                worldwide sales of Barbie dolls as little girls embraced MGA 
                Entertainment’s Bratz. <br>
                <br>
                Mattel recently dropped Lionsgate as the distributor of its 
                lucrative Barbie DVD franchise and hired Universal Studios to 
                give the directto-DVD films the red-carpet treatment, complete 
                with film trailers, ad campaigns and retail tie-ins.<br>
                <br>
                The two companies also discussed the possibility of a Barbie tie 
                in with Universal’s theme parks and theatrical premieres for 
                upcoming Barbie animated films.<br>
                <br>
                With her impossible proportions and ever-changing careers, 
                Barbie stood by her message that girls can be anything they want 
                throughout most of her 47-year life span. But as the No. 1 
                selling US fashion doll lost young fans to the savvy, 
                multi-ethnic Bratz dolls, Mattel started to chase the teen 
                culture and lose sight of Barbie’s message, independent toy 
                analyst Chris Byrne said. <br>
                <br>
                Mattel’s hook-up with Universal to promote the animated films 
                appeared calculated to bring more visibility to both doll brands 
                and to reposition Barbie with her core fans, Byrne said. “It’s 
                really a strong move for them,” Byrne said. “They really are 
                moving themselves back into owning a specific imaginative 
                space...a Barbie girl is this fantasy princess story line and 
                they’re saying, ‘So why don’t we own that?’” <br>
                <br>
                Richard Dickson, senior vice-president of marketing, media and 
                entertainment for Mattel Brands, said the decision to switch 
                distributors stemmed from the company’s desire to “take a longer 
                term approach” to marketing the Barbie DVDs.</font></p>

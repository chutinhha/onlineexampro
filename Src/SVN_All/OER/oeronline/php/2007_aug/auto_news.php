        rippling beneath its metal skin. When on slippery road surfaces, 
        traction control continually monitors the rotational speed of each 
        wheel. If one wheel is spinning more than the others, traction control 
        applies braking pressure to the spinning wheel to help it regain its 
        composure and transfers available torque to the wheels that have 
        traction. Using this system, the Hummer H3 with three spinning wheels

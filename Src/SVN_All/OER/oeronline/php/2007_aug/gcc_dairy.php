        Africa regularly frequent blogs, social network sites, email discussion 
        groups, community boards and other web-based sources, according to a 
        research carried out by the leading job site, Bayt.com. The survey, 
        conducted in conjunction with market research company YouGovSiraj, 
        revealed that rising internet use and its increasing penetration is 
        having a profound effect on regional consumer behaviour. <br>
        <br>
        Of 4,600 Bayt.com users – both males and females – polled, an 
        overwhelming 81 per cent admitted that the internet has made them more 
        favourable towards certain brands. ‘The results should serve as a 
        wake-up call to anyone in this region who has an interest in marketing 
        and media,’ said Rabea Ataya, CEO of Bayt.com. “Our latest study marks a 
        pioneering step in understanding how people in the region use the 
        internet when making their buying decisions.” The study reported that 
        the internet currently ranks second to word-of-mouth when it comes to 
        influencing people’s purchasing decisions, with 43 per cent saying they 
        used websites as a source of information as compared to 55 per cent who 
        relied on people they knew. Newspapers came in third with 40 per cent. 
        Again, the internet proved to be an important source for research, with 
        76 per cent agreeing that they sought more information on a service or 
        product on the web after seeing it advertised in other media. Online 
        advertising also impacted in-store behaviour, with 64 per cent agreeing 
        that they often checked out a product in the store after noticing a 
        web-based advertisement. <br>
        <br>
        Ringing the warning bells for the traditional media, 47 per cent said 
        they used the internet for more than three hours per day, compared to 
        only 18 per cent for television viewers. In Kuwait, 54 per cent of 
        internet users spent more than three hours a day online. Overall, there 
        was a positive feeling regarding the impact of internet on purchases, 
        shopping behaviour and attitudes. The internet made 83 per cent aware of 
        a new brand while 68 per cent later bought the brand. Again, the 
        internet influenced 59 per cent users to change brands. <br>
        <br>
        “One of the key findings of this study is that people trust their own 
        abilities to use this medium to inform their purchasing decisions,” said 
        Ataya. ‘More than a third of respondents regarded themselves as having 
        expert internet capability, while 47 per cent described themselves as 
        knowledgeable. This is a sign that consumer control is really taking 
        off.” Ataya added the survey revealed the internet goes beyond informing 
        purchasing decisions. Some 58 per cent of respondents, for instance, say 
        they have bought items online. For GCC Arabs, the figure was 52 per 
        cent, for the UAE 49 per cent, and for Egypt 25 per cent. <br>
        <br>
        In terms of the kinds of online purchases, travel came out on top, with 
        41 per cent of respondents making online travel-related transactions 
        over the past 12 months, followed by software and books at 40 per cent. 
        Furniture purchases ranked the lowest, at 4 per cent. For services, 42 
        per cent said they had found a job online, while 39 per cent said they 
        paid their utility or other bills. The level of satisfaction in terms of 
        online transactions was high, with 58 per cent stating they were 
        satisfied compared to 14 per cent expressing dissatisfaction. But there 
        were barriers to online purchasing. The survey found that 62 per cent of 
        respondents claimed they would prefer to see a product prior to 
        purchase, while 45 per cent cited the fact they didn’t have a credit 
        card as the reason for not buying online. Such people, the study 
        suggests, use the internet primarily for research and make their 
        purchases in-store. <br>

        <b>Maktoob to establish online Arabic social network</b><br>
        Maktoob.com has partnered with Faye3.com, the winner of this year’s

        to create the largest social network in the Arabic-speaking world, one 
        that caters to the likes and tastes of Arab web users. Samih Toukan, CEO 
        of the Maktoob Group, said: “social networking is an emerging phenomenon 
        and today, the web is enabling everyone to create their own community 
        based on their interests and locations. The platform aims at providing 
        the tools for these active people.”<br>

        Driven by the regional economic boom, Gulf companies raised US$105 
        billion during the first six months of this year, according to a report 
        by Thomson, an international information service provider. “Fast-growing 
        companies need capital and are turning towards the bond and loans 
        markets for cash. Mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings 
        have also fuelled the leap,” the Thomson report informed.<br>
        <br>
        Thomson’s noted that using the five popular financial instruments of 
        IPOs, M&amp;As, bonds, project finance and corporate loans, the capital 
        raised by GCC companies increased by 25 per cent from year-ago levels. 
        More corporate borrowers are turning to bonds or sukuk as a means of 
        raising finance. Project finance reported a sharp decline while M&amp;A 
        activity originating from the region in the first half exceeded that 
        seen in whole of last year. The big US banks pretty much cornered most 
        of the big-ticket deals, with the local banks remaining on the fringes.<br>

        <b>ME pharma, biotech market worth $28bn</b><br>
        The Middle East market for pharmaceutical manufacturing and 
        biotechnology is valued at over US$28 billion, according to the 
        organisers of the region’s premier industry event ‘Pharmaceutical 
        Manufacturing and Biotechnology Middle East (PABME)’. With a 
        double-digit annual growth, the market looks set for even stronger 
        growth as some of the world’s major players eye the regional market. An 
        estimated 450 pharmaceutical manufacturers already operate in the Middle 
        East, a market valued at over US$ 18 billion and growing at more than 10 
        per cent per annum. The regional biotechnology market is smaller (US$10 
        billion) than pharmaceutical manufacturing but is growing at an even 
        faster pace, at 15-18 per cent per annum.<br>
        <br>
        <b>IMF: Gulf oil producers should maintain dollar-peg </b><br>
        The International Monetary Fund ha said that Gulf oil producers, 
        including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, should keep their 
        currencies fixed to the dollar. “A fixed exchange rate is best for these 
        oil producers,” said Mohsin Khan, IMF’s director for the Middle East and 
        Central Asia. “Their main export is priced in dollars, it makes it 
        easier for them to hedge.” Recently Morgan Stanley had stated that 
        Middle East oil producers might face pressure to revalue their 
        currencies to narrow the surpluses. “The analytical framework for 
        deciding on fundamental misalignment for oil producers is lacking, 
        because some of these countries are running surpluses through no fault 
        of their own,” said Khan. Some time back, IMF had said that it requires 
        all 185-member countries to reject practices that create instability for 
        other nations, such as “currency misalignment.” </font></p>

        Burj Dubai – at 512.1 metres (1,680 ft) – developed by Emaar Properties 
        has become the tallest building in the world, at the time of going to 
        the press. Burj Dubai is now taller than Taipei 101 in Taiwan, which at 
        508 metres (1,667 ft) held the tallest-building-in-the-world title since 
        it opened in 2004. Burj Dubai has now reached 141 storeys – more storeys 
        than any other building in the world. On schedule for completion in 
        2008, Burj Dubai will be the tallest structure in the world in all four 
        of the criteria listed by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban 
        Habitat (CTBUH). The council measures height to the structural top, the 
        highest occupied floor, to the top of the roof, and to the tip of the 
        spire, pinnacle, antenna, mast or flag pole.<br>
        <br>
        During its construction, Burj Dubai has left behind the skyscrapers that 
        previously defined tall tower architecture around the world, such as 
        Petronas Towers in Malaysia (452 metres, 1,483 ft); Sears Tower, Chicago 
        (442 metres, 1,451 ft); Jin Mao Building, Shanghai (421 metres, 1,381 
        ft) and Empire State Building, New York (381 metres, 1,250 ft). When 
        completed, Burj Dubai will have 56 elevators travelling at 1.75 to 10 
        metres/sec and double-decker observatory elevators that can carry 42 
        people at a time.<br>

        Emaar Properties has partnered with leading consultants such as South 
        Korean construction major Samsung Corporation and New York-based Project 
        Manager Turner Construction for the project. The US$20-billion 500-acre 
        downtown development is billed as the most prestigious square kilometre 
        on earth. Burj Dubai will feature residential, commercial and retail 
        components including the world’s first Armani Hotel &amp; Residences, 
        exclusive corporate suites, a business centre, four luxurious pools and 
        spas, an observation platform on Level 124 and 150,000 sq ft of fitness

        An additional 22,000 hotel rooms are expected to be available in Dubai 
        by the end of 2008 and this is seen helping the fast-growing tourism 
        destination overcome part of its room shortage. Dubai had a total of 415 
        hotels and furnished apartments last year, offering about 40,000 rooms 
        in various categories, according to the Department of Tourism and 
        Commerce Marketing (DTCM). Dubai hotels received about 6.5 million 
        guests in 2006 compared with 6.1 million a year before. The tourism 
        department projects the number of hotel rooms to increase to 93,867 in

        Saudi Arabia’s extremely low rate of broadband internet usage could 
        expand 16-fold in the next three years due to new operators coming 
        online. A report by EFG-Hermes, a regional investment bank, said 
        spending on Saudi Arabian telecom services totalled US$10.6 billion last 
        year, making it the largest and one of the fastest growing markets in 
        the region. The glaring exception to this robust market growth has been 
        broadband internet, which currently reaches less than 1 per cent of its 
        24 million residents. But with three new fixed line operators expected 
        in 2008, EFG-Hermes is projecting broadband to be rolled out in a 
        dramatic fashion by 2010. EFG-Hermes said demand for high bandwidth 
        connectivity is rising from the business sector and households. “In

        everyone by surprise. According to media reports in Bahrain, Dose 
        tendered his resignation following a reported split with the board over 
        how the airline was being run. Dose had taken up his position only in 
        April and had since then been pushing through a series of cost-cutting 
        measures in the ailing carrier. The sudden resignation came just days 
        after Gulf Air Chairman Mahmood Hashim Al Kooheji confirmed that the 
        airline was being investigated by Bahrain prosecutors. Gulf Air may now 
        look for a homegrown candidate to fill up the vacant post, specially as 
        the Gulf Air’s trade union says it was time to stem the ‘foreign 
        invasion’. </font><br>

        Nawras has issued guidelines to protect its customers from a virus 
        causing problems for many mobile users in the UAE. The virus, 
        CommWarrior, mainly spreads through MMS and Bluetooth, and infects some 
        mobile phones with .sis file attachments. Nawras’ network includes a 
        filter system that helps to block the virus from spreading through the 
        MMS. Says Nawras product manager, Yasser Al-Ameer, “this virus attacks 
        mobile phones operating on a Symbian operating system, such as Nokia 
        N70, 6680 and 6630. Quite often, the recipient is unaware of the problem 
        because the virus uses different file names to pass on the infection. In 
        the UAE, the virus was mainly spread through the MMS. Nawras now has a 
        message virus filter, which makes this virtually impossible. However it 
        can still spread through the Bluetooth, so I will urge customers to only 
        turn on their Bluetooth when they actually have to use it.”</font><hr width="90%" size="1">

        that it will launch Write-Once Blu-ray Discs (BD-R) with 4x writing 
        speed in the Middle East. Single-layer discs with 25GB capacity 
        (LM-BR25LDE) will be available this month while dual-layer with 50GB 
        capacity (LM-BR50LDE) will be available in September. In conjunction 
        with the launch of 4x BD drives, the new discs have the capability of 4x 
        speed writing and reading, allowing users to handle large amount of data 
        or High Definition content with greater convenience. Panasonic is the 
        first company to announce the market introduction of 4x BD-R Discs. 
        “Since introducing the world’s first dual layer 1xBD-RE Disc in 2004, 
        Panasonic has continued to lead the market and develop the Blu-ray Disc 
        technologies to meet the growing demand for high-speed reading and 
        writing of massive volumes of data. The new 4x Discs have the maximum 
        data transfer speed of 144Mbps, which means they can copy a 1GB folder 
        in just one minute, while a DVD-RW(2x data transfer speed) needs 6 
        minutes,” said Yasuo Kimoto, Product Manager, Panasonic Marketing Middle 
        East. The high data transfer speed is achieved by the application of new 
        phase-change recording technology which was realized through Panasonic‘s 
        35-years of experience in Optical Disc development. The result is 
        precise and stable recording even when writing at 4x high speed.</font><hr width="90%" size="1">

        showcasing many of their finest signature cuisines in a live open 
        kitchen. The venue will also be dressed in traditional Malaysian 
        ambiance, and music and entertainment will decorate the evening at Samba 
        Restaurant, one of the resort’s award winning restaurants. “Malaysian 
        cuisine is not just one particular distinction of food but a culinary 
        diversity originating from it’s multi-ethnic population of Malay, 
        Indian, Eurasian, Chinese, Nyonya and the Indigenous peoples of Borneo,” 
        says Bukhairi.</font><hr width="90%" size="1">

        voting starts on August 5<br>

        <img border="0" src="bill12.jpg" width="58" height="222" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The International Federation of 
        Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) and the Supply Chain and 
        Logistics Group (SCLG) have joined the Middle East Logistics Awards (MELA) 
        as industry support patrons. Their move came just as the date for the 
        nomination phase for the second annual MELA awards (MELA 2007) lapsed. 
        As part of the deal, FIATA President Manfred F Boes, and SCLG 
        consultative committee member, Dr KM Madrecha have joined the MELA 
        Advisory Board. <br>
        <br>
        As part of MELA 2007, 25 awards will be given to stellar performers in 
        the Middle East logistics industry in the air, sea and land categories 
        at a function to be held on November 6 in Madinat Jumeirah, Dubai, UAE.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reacting to the decision of FIATA and SCLG to endorse MELA, Aleem Aziz, 
        Chief Executive Officer, MELA Management Office, Dubai, and Member, MELA 
        Executive Board, said, “it reiterates our endeavour to recognise 
        performance excellence in the logistics industry in the region. These 
        two industry bodies have extensive reach and influence among the 
        logistics community and their support will further strengthen the value 
        and the spirit of the MELA awards.”<br>
        <br>
        On his part, Manfred F Boes was all praise for MELA for its efforts in 
        setting the benchmark for excellence in the logistics industry. “The 
        MELA Awards organised by the Media One Group have brought together the 
        entire logistics community in the region and set the benchmark for 
        performance excellence in the industry. These yearly awards encourage 
        the industry to be always at their best and offer a common platform for 
        networking. FIATA patronises the MELA Awards and its pursuit to 
        recognise stellar performers in the Middle East logistics industry,” 
        Boes affirmed.<br>
        <br>
        Reiterating Boes’ views, Dr KM Madrecha of SCLG applauded the objectives 
        of the MELA Awards. “We are happy to be an industry associate for the 
        MELA Awards. SCLG strongly supports the vision and the mission that MELA 
        has set out – to give due recognition to individuals and organisations 
        who have made outstanding achievements in the Middle East logistics 
        industry.”<br>
        <br>
        The organisers of the MELA 2007 awards feel that the support of Fiata 
        and SCLG will encourage participation of the Middle East logistics 
        community. “These awards empower the logistics industry in the region. 
        We are expecting extensive participation from the Middle East logistics 
        community in the voting process for the selection of the winners of the 
        2007 MELA Awards. Patronage by industry associations like Fiata and SCLG 
        will ensure active industry involvement,” remarked Dr Mahmoud Abdallat, 
        Secretary General, Arab Union of Land Transport, Jordan, and Member, 
        MELA Advisory Board. <br>
        <br>
        FIATA, based in Glattbrugg, Switzerland, is one of the largest global 
        non-governmental industry associations engaged in the field of 
        transportation. Similarly, SCLG, based in Dubai, UAE, endeavours to 
        improve the supply chain and logistics industry through awareness, 
        training, seminars and networking among the world’s top logistics 
        companies.<br>
        <br>
        The first MELA Awards, presented on November 21, 2006, saw a total of 27 
        individuals and organisations being honoured for their performance 
        excellence in the dynamic and increasingly competitive logistics 
        industry in the Middle East. More than 800 professionals from the entire 
        Middle East logistics community converged for the MELA 2006 Awards 
        function. <br>
        <br>
        MELA 2007 is being organised and managed by Eventis, a Media One Group 
        company. Both the nomination and voting processes are audited by AGNMAK, 
        the official auditors, who will also prepare the list of nominees for 
        each award. The voting phase for MELA 2007 Awards starts on August 5 and 
        ends on September 6. </font>

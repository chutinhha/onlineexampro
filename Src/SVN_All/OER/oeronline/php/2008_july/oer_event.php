<b>There is not a business in America that does not want to be more creative in 
its thinking, products and processes. And Tom Kelley, General Manager – IDEO, 
knows how to foster a culture of creativity and develop processes for continuous 
innovation. Kelley was one of the guest speakers at the Mangement Innovation 
Forum held in Dubai. Excerpts from the interview<br>
<br>
What are the essential traits that innovative leaders share?</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="OEREVENT.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="251" height="268">This 
is an important question with many, many answers, but I will suggest four traits 
that come to mind: The greatest single skill for an innovation leader is to 
nurture other innovators. One of the ‘Ten Faces of Innovation’ in my current 
book is called The Director. The best innovation ‘directors’ aren’t just 
autocrats trying to get everything their way. The best directors, like great 
film directors, never take the stage themselves. They see it as their job to 
attract the most talented, the most creative people in the world and then let 
them do their best work.<br>
<br>
A second characteristic of innovation leaders is that they realise their 
companies don’t have to do everything themselves. The best companies in the 
world are practicing “open innovation,” seeking ideas, technologies, and 
insights from creative sources around the world. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, truly great companies have leaders who are always a little bit 
restless, always wanting to do a little bit more. I think that is a good thing. 
The best companies are those who keep upping the pace, even when they are at the 
front of the pack.<br>
<br>
And finally, what innovation leaders do is try to create an “idea friendly” 
environment, one in which managers are quick to build on new ideas and slow to 
judge them. If you want to have a culture of innovation, don’t delegate idea 
generation to your equivalent of the “innovation department.” Let all the 
departments feel that continuous generation of new ideas is not only their right 
but also their responsibility.<br>
<br>
<b>How has IDEO managed to stay at the cutting edge of design?</b><br>
Clayton Christensen at Harvard Business School says that in all organisations 
you face disruptors — new entrants and innovators who will aim to take away a 
piece of the business that is yours. In the long run, Christensen warns that the 
only defence against those disruptors is a strong offense: You have to be your 
own disruptor. You have to keep up a rapid pace of innovation and be willing to 
change quickly in response to — or in anticipation of — changes in the world 
around you. One thing we have tried to do at IDEO over the past 30 years is to 
evolve the firm at least as fast as the global business environment. That has 
meant being willing to change the people we hire, the projects we do, and the 
process of our work. Along the way, we have changed our working vocabulary and 
even our definition of design itself. What we have done over the past few 
decades is what we encourage our clients to do every day: be true to your core 
values, but be willing to change everything else, up to and including the 
definition of your work itself.<br>
<b><br>
Why is it important for companies to constantly innovate? Can you give us some 
real life examples of companies which have followed this path to success?</b><br>
<br>
In the “flat world” of today’s global economy, companies have no choice but to 
innovate. Of the clients I’ve worked with in the past couple of decades, two 
innovation success stories that come to mind are Samsung and Procter &amp; Gamble. 
Unlike companies such as Google and Apple that were centered around innovation 
and design from their inception, Samsung and P&amp;G had to nurture a culture of 
innovation inside a large corporation that had a long history and a strong set 
of existing cultural values.<br>
<br>
Let us take the Samsung story. Samsung today is a powerful global brand, but 
having worked with them extensively over the years, we know that was not always 
the case. Samsung has used design and innovation to rise through the ranks of 
consumer electronics companies and become a world leader. <br>
<br>
While on an international trip in 1993, Samsung Chairman Lee Kun Hee observed 
that Samsung’s products had only “me too” status in a competitive marketplace. 
His observation sparked a new fire at Samsung that is still burning today. Soon 
after that trip, Samsung launched a series of brand-building initiatives, 
including a collaboration with IDEO. <br>
<br>
As a very large and hierarchical corporation, Samsung has had many hurdles to 
overcome, but they have relentlessly pursued their innovation programme, even to 
the point of letting young innovators challenge more senior members of the firm. 
By opening up creative offices in California—as well as London and Tokyo—Samsung 
built a process of observing consumer trends there, and then cross-pollinating 
concepts from creative centers around the world. Along the way, they’ve proven 
that they are willing to listen to great ideas that did not necessarily 
originate in Seoul.</font><table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px dashed #FFFFFF" width="99%" bgcolor="#FFCC66" height="277">

		<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What is the essence of the ‘Deep Dive’ 
		approach that you have elucidated in “The Art of Innovation’?</b><br>
		IDEO developed the Deep Dive process more than a decade ago as a way to 
		create new solutions via a total immersion in a particular problem. Our 
		approach has something in common with immersion language programmes. You 
		can try to learn a foreign language going to class one night a week, but 
		you might never achieve fluency using that approach. But if you immerse 
		yourself in a learning environment where that language is the only one 
		available, you can sometimes make very rapid progress in a short period 
		of time.<br>
		<br>
		Our Deep Dives are the same way. Participants shut out all other 
		distractions and focus relentlessly on a single issue for a few days. We 
		start by playing the role of anthropologist by observing human behaviour 
		and looking for latent customer needs. We hold intensive brainstorming 
		to generate new ideas. We do lots of quick prototypes and experiments to 
		see which ideas are most promising as potential solutions to address 
		those needs. We make the ideas tangible, show them to people who might 
		use our solution, and then try to make our concept even better. The 
		process is exhausting, but we often come out with breakthrough results.</font></td>

We’ve done dozens of such programmes, but the most visible one was a Deep Dive 
we did for an American television show called Nightline several years ago. 
HostTed Koppel and the Nightline team gave us a challenge on Monday morning at 
9, and we had four days to conceive and implement possible solutions. The topic 
they gave us had to do with grocery shopping carts, but they were less 
interested in the topic itself than in watching the process of innovation 
unfold. Our Deep Dive episode was one of the most popular segments in the 
history of the show, and the resulting video is part of a Harvard Business 
School case study on innovation still used in MBA programmes today. <br>
<br>
<b>What are the strategies that companies should follow to ensure that their 
innovative ideas are successful in the market?</b><br>
Companies just need to look beyond the myths of innovation and dedicate enough 
energy to bringing those ideas to market.<br>
<br>
Myth 1: Innovation is expensive. Short-sighted managers who focus only on the 
cost outlays and the investment required to nurture a culture of innovation 
among their employees are missing the point. In the long run, innovation is 
cheap. Mediocrity is what’s truly expensive. Innovation is good value, because 
innovation can dramatically improve a company’s margins. <br>
<br>
Myth 2: Innovation is hard. Advertising guru David Ogilvy was fond of saying 
that there are no tired brands, only tired brand managers. An executive in a 
modern corporation today who feels that innovation is too hard might want to 
take a good look in the mirror. In fact, our own experience suggests that 
innovation can be quite enjoyable, in spite of the challenges and strains it 
puts on the team. Ask anyone who has been part of a hot project team, creating 
something new to the world – usually within tight budget and schedule 
constraints – and they will likely tell you it was challenging, but also 
exhilarating and even fun.<br>
<br>
Myth 3: Innovation is risky. Devils advocates and other anti-innovation forces 
are staunch defenders of the status quo. They often like to repeat a slang 
expression in America that says “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” 
Unfortunately, those people who resist change overlook the fact that sometimes, 
if you want things to remain “the same,” you have to be willing to change a lot. 
For example, if a successful company wants to preserve their same market share, 
their same revenue growth, their same pattern of staff development, it typically 
needs a rate of innovation equal to or greater than the pace set by competitors 
in its industry. Ultimately, not innovating is the ultimate risk. <br>
<br>
<b>Can companies in the Middle East be as innovative as their contemporaries in 
the US? What should be done to foster the spirit of innovation in the region?
</b><br>
Innovation can be found anywhere, and we believe that all enterprises have 
latent creative talents inside their best teams. There is no regional barrier to 
innovation, and Dubai is living proof. Dubai-based enterprises are not only 
innovative but in some cases unique in the world. I’ve stayed in literally a 
thousand hotels around the world. Even among a cast of thousands, the Burj Al 
Arab stands out head and shoulders above the crowd. It represents breakthrough 
innovation in several respects.<br>
<br>
And having been an airline consultant prior to my career, I had the opportunity 
to work with — and fly extensively on — some of the best Asian and European 
carriers, nothing prepared me for my recent experience in the first class cabin 
of Emirates Air. It feels more like flying in private jets than any commercial 
flights I have been on in the past. So I refuse to believe that Middle East 
companies can’t keep up with or leap ahead of their peer <br>
anywhere in the world. <br>

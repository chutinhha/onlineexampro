have lost more than 50 per cent of their value in the past eight months. Bear 
markets may be the kiss of death for global exchanges, but they also create 
opportunities</b><br>
<br>
The last decade saw a frenzy of new issue listings, mergers and consolidations 
among the world’s stock exchanges. The NYSE, Euronext, Chicago Merc, NYMEX, 
NASDAQ, OMX, Dubai Financial Markets, Deutsche Borse, Singapore Exchange (SGX) 
and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing proved spectacularly profitable 
investments in their own right. The FTSE Exchange Index rose a spectacular ten 
times between 2001 and 2007, with an annual return of an incredible 35 per cent, 
far more than even the world’s best performing stock indices. The past eight 
months, has seen the valuations, daily turnover and share prices of global 
exchanges evaporating. Exchanges such as Singapore’s SGX, London’s LSE, 
Chicago’s CME and Frankfurt’s Deutsche Borse have now lost more than 50 per cent 
of their value. Bear markets may be the kiss of death for global exchanges, but 
bear markets also create opportunities in this exciting sector.<br>
<br>
<b>Singapore sling</b><br>
<img border="0" src="PERISCOPE2.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">The Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) is the leading cash and derivatives exchange 
in Southeast Asia. The SGX was a fairy tale investment from 2004 to October 
2007, soaring from Sing $2 to $17 on the exponential rise in trading volumes and 
stock market indices. From the creation of SIMEX as a futures exchange to trade 
the Japanese Nikkei’s stock index and the Merc’s Eurodollar futures contract in 
1984, Singapore Inc was determined to position its exchanges as the hub for pan 
Asian, not just, local financial markets products.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;So Singapore’s SGX grabbed one fourth of the global market share on the 
Nikkei 225 contract (more than Osaka) and began to trade futures contracts on 
the stock indices of Taiwan, India and Malaysia, easily outpacing its competitor 
exchanges in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Global financial futures, options, swap and 
warrants trading grew at 25 per cent a year in the Pacific Basin as regional 
banking systems, insurers and fund managers increasingly embraced risk 
management and risk insurance products. Singapore also has a stellar record in 
product innovation, introducing recently the world’s first Sharia compliant 
Japanese large cap fund in collaboration with Daiwa Asset Management to attract 
Middle East investors. The SGX also attracted global investors with its Chinese 
and Indian IPOs, its shipping trusts, its REITS and its structured warrant 
products, that grew at an annual rate of 50 per cent as the Asian bull market 
attracted retail speculators.<br>
<br>
However, the SGX share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent to 7.4 
Singapore dollars from its high of 17 last autumn. As Chinese, Indian and 
Southeast Asian stock market indices plunged after the Wall Street credit 
meltdown, the exodus of hedge funds from emerging markets and monetary 
tightening of Asian central banks, daily trading volumes on the SGX have 
plummeted from 3 billion last summer to less than 2 billion Singapore dollars 
now. As the SGX shares are almost totally correlated to exchange turnover, I 
cannot get positive on its shares until daily turnover volumes and the stock 
indices stabilise. I believe that the SGX bottom will coincide with a 2600-2800 
on the Straits Times index and 1.5 billion Sing dollar daily trading volume. 
This means the EPS of SGX can easily fall to 25- 26 cents. Valuations will 
continue to compress as US Treasury bond yields rise and can well fall to 15X 
next years earnings. <br>
<br>
So it is not all unreasonable to expect a Sing $4-4.5 “bottom” price on the SGX 
if the bear market in Singapore continues. Bottom fishing is extremely dangerous 
in the shares of a stock exchange trapped in a vicious bear market. However, 
amidst all the gloom and doom, it is critical not to lose perspective that SGX 
is the gateway to the world’s most dynamic growth engine. While algorithmic 
trading will not boost market turnover and Asian nationalism do not merit a 
takeover premium on the SGX, I am convinced that it is entirely possible to 
double one’s money on the SGX as long as the buy level is at or near a market 
bottom of SGD4-4.5. After all, SGX owns 5 per cent of the Bombay Stock Exchange 
and will take a strategic stake in the Taiwan stock exchange IPO in 2009. <br>
<br>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange also owns 4.9 per cent of SGX, meaning that Singapore 
will increasingly attract Japanese exchange funds and derivatives contracts 
targeted at international investors. As the spectacular success of the Aussie 
dollar and Kiwi dollar, Uradishi bonds and Samurai (offshore) Euromarkets prove, 
Japan’s retail, bank and institutional investors can create highly profitable 
riches in the international financial markets constellation for nimble 
intermediaries like the SGX.<br>
<br>
<b>LSE too succumbs</b><br>
Few strategic investments by Gulf sovereign wealth funds were as ill fated as 
the London Stock Exchange (LSE), one of the true iconic brands in international 
finance, in existence since three centuries. The LSE rejected takeover bids from 
NASDAQ, Deutsche Borse and Euronext, instead selling strategic stakes of 20.4 
per cent to Borse Dubai and 15 per cent to the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). 
Yet 2008 was a disaster for Britain’s leading cash equities, debt and 
derivatives exchange. Borse Dubai and QIA have taken huge losses as the LSE 
share price plunged from 20 pound sterling last January to July to only 9 pounds 
now. The CEO of the LSE has even travelled to Doha to reassure the Qataris about 
management strategy. LSE fell victim to the global credit crisis, increase in 
competitive risk, the fall in international IPO issuance and sluggish daily 
volumes in London STEPS and its Borsa Italiana subsidiary. <br>
<br>
Market share in UK cash equities is increasingly shifting from primary markets 
to alternative exchanges, the liquidity venues of the current decade. LSE 
rejected NASDAQ’s 12.40 offer two years ago and NASDAQ then bought the Swedish 
operator of Nordic/Baltic stock exchange OMX. A bad move for the LSE, Borse 
Dubai and Qatar.<br>
<br>
Chi- X, a unit of Instinet Europe, the electronic stock exchange trading system, 
directly targets LSE’s listed equities. Chi- X will broker 25 percent of trading 
in Footsie 100 shares by next year. The success of Chi- X is due to the EU’s new 
Market in the Financial Instruments Directive, which encourages alternative 
electronic trading platforms such as Chi- X, Turquoise and Plus Market Group PLC 
to compete with incumbent, traditional stock exchanges. The LSE is extremely 
dependent on cash equities and the UK markets, not as exposed to high growth 
derivatives markets as the NYSE Euronext or the Deutsche Borse. New issuer 
service revenues are correlated to the size and success of international IPOs, 
but the credit crisis has killed international new issues. This suggests 
revenues will not rise by 30 percent, unlike 2008.<br>
<br>
The LSE has lost more than half its market cap as well as its credibility with 
the global financial markets. The LSE trades at 13 times forward earnings, among 
the cheapest exchanges in the world. It is now takeover bait for the Deutsche 
Borse, possibly the only way Borse Dubai and Qatar Investment Authority can 
recoup their losses. The LSE is a buy at 8 pounds for an 11 target. </font></p>

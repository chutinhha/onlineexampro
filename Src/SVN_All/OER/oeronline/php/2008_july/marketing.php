Banking trends</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>banking institutions in the region are becoming increasingly aware of the 
benefits of Online banking, leading to the adoption of a fully functional and 
integrated online channel <br>
</b><br>
<br>
Online banking has taken off. Most of the banking institutions in the region now 
have a fully functioning and integrated online channel. However, there are still 
a few that have not embraced this technology. Those financial institutions who 
have adopted online banking practices have done so because it enhances the 
customer experience, and it is convenient.<br>
<br>
As market observers, we have seen five trends in the online banking space which 
banks should consider:<br>
<br>
<b>Leading trends </b><br>
Security concerns are of major importance to online consumers. This is 
understandable but is also a very general insight. Firms with online activities 
will therefore have to deal with the matter in a more differentiated way. Those 
who are concerned about security have identified the lack of staff awareness as 
the most dangerous threat followed by those from viruses, Trojan horses, and 
worms.<br>
<br>
This holds true for all sectors. The financial industry, however, is 
particularly sensitive to the topic. The fear of a lack of security is a greater 
hurdle to those Internet users who do not use online banking, than missing 
monetary incentives or insufficient comfort or functionality. Customer retention 
becomes ever more important. Research shows that the more services a customer 
uses, the higher the real and psychological switching costs will be. Also, the 
more services a customer uses, the greater are the bank’s expected profits. 
Customer loyalty, therefore, gains precedence over customer acquisition, and the 
value of customer relationship management becomes apparent. <br>
<br>
Technological progress will give a boost to existing online banking services and 
devices. Their quality will improve. Ever faster and more powerful chips and the 
widespread use of broadband Internet access will make online banking more 
comfortable for more and more people without necessarily triggering the 
emergence of completely new devices and inventions.<br>
<br>
Some players will take a second stab at mobile banking. Increasingly faster 
transmission via GPRS or UMTS feeds the vision that mobile banking merits 
another attempt – in spite of the GSM failure. Indeed, many advantages can be 
thought of, SMS alerts allow a move away from the more expensive channels of 
communication, like contact centres. Also, useful information can be transmitted 
to the client, and increase customer loyalty at low cost. However, a 
comprehensive business case in transaction banking and brokerage with cost 
covering revenues is currently not in sight.<br>
<br>
An increasing number of visitors to bank websites do considerable online 
research before making financial decisions. They shop around for financial 
products, and make their own investment decisions – in part without consultants. 
Researching via the Internet is gaining importance in online banking.<br>
<br>
<b>Benefits galore</b><br>
Understanding how online banking can compliment your banks distribution mix and 
enhance your customer’s overall experience should be on the agenda of all 
financial institutions. Designing the most appropriate experience will in turn 
help boost the bottomline of a bank’s accounts as it moves its customers to a 
more cost effective channel. <br>
However, if not executed correctly through an informed research process, the 
result could be disastrous, resulting in disengaged customers with whom you lose 
that valuable interaction. The flip side is, if done well it puts the power back 
in the consumer hands allowing them to bank as they please when they please.<br>
There are marketing companies, which provide its clients with objective and 
reliable marketing information and consumer insights that add value to their 
business. The goal is to help clients make decisions that will enable them to 
build revenue and profits. <br>

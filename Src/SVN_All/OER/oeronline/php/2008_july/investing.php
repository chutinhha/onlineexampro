<br>
<b>With increased liquidity in the market and Muscat Securities Market returning 
good growth, mutual funds in Oman are increasingly becoming a favourite 
investment instrument, especially among the small investors. Jessica Brookes 
takes a look at their growth and why they are a better bet compared to direct 
investment<br>
</b><br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Recently, there was a mad rush among investors to apply for Voltamp Energy’s 
initial public offering (IPO), the first one to hit the market this year. The 
market expects a similar response to Sohar Power IPO that is expected to open 
for subscription in July. With MSM 30, the key index on the Muscat Stock Market 
appreciating as high as 79.36 per cent in the 52-weeks period ending 30 June 
2008, investors are flocking to the stock market in anticipation of multiplying 
their money in quick time. But if you are not a very well informed investor, you 
may not be able to get the best returns on your investment. That’s where mutual 
funds come into the picture to maximise your returns on investment with a 
comparatively lesser degree of risk compared to direct investments.<br>

<b>Market Performance</b><br>
Though mutual funds have existed in Oman for almost a decade-and-half, they have 
become more popular in the last three years with MSM 30 appreciating by more 
than 105 per cent. What makes mutual funds popular is that many of them have 
returned better appreciation compared to the average MSM 30 growth. In fact, 
most of the mutual funds in Oman strive to outperform the <br>
<br>
<b>MSM 30 index.</b><br>
As per rough estimates, the total fund size is expected to be above RO100 
million. The market is quite small compared to other GCC states but it is 
evolving steadily. <br>
<br>
The market is dominated by Al Amal Fund JIA and Majan Capital Fund JIA (managed 
by Fincorp), Muscat Fund and Oryx Fund (BankMuscat), The First Mazoon Fund (Gulf 
Baader Capital Markets), and Vision Emerging Oman Fund and Vision Emerging GCC 
Fund (Vision Investment Services). Most of the funds invest primarily on MSM but 
also pick up stocks in the regional and global bourses. There are a few 
dedicated funds as well that focus on GCC markets only. <br>
<br>
Talking about the performance of Al Amal Fund JIA, Dinakar Rao, EVP and 
Head-Asset Management, Fincorp said, “The fund currently has a size of over RO9 
million and growing. The fund came into being in March 2005 and it returned 12.5 
per cent for the period between March-December 2005. It gave 15 per cent in 2006 
and 61.2 per cent in 2007. And this year (so far), we have returned 34.30 per 
cent. Since inception, its NAV has gone up by 182.33 per cent.” <br>

Fincorp’s other fund, Majan Capital Fund JIA, has returned 32.3 per cent this 
year so far and in 2007, it gave an appreciation of 43.8 per cent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="INVESTING1.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="190" height="248">BankMuscat’s Ali Said Ali, Assistant General Manager-Asset Management and 
Private Banking informed, “Our GCC focused fund, Oryx Fund, has given return of 
274.5 per cent during last five years and was up by 45.3 per cent in 2007 and is 
up 14.1 per cent till May 2008. Similarly, our Oman focused Muscat Fund has 
achieved 441.5 per cent over the last five years and is up 29.4 per cent in 
2008.”<br>
<br>
On the First Mazoon Fund JIA, Sankar Kailasam, VP-Asset Management, Gulf Baader 
Capital Markets said, “The fund has given a return of 479.6 per cent in the last 
five years vis-à-vis 407.05 per cent achieved by MSM 30 Index.”<br>
<br>
Hussain Al Lawati, Vice President-Asset Management, Vision Investment Service 
said, “We launched Vision Emerging Oman Fund in August last year and it is up by 
almost 73 per cent since then. Our Vision Emerging GCC Fund was launched in May 
2005 and has given a return of over 107 per cent in the last three years, 
despite the fact that the MSCI GCC Index is down by 4 per cent. Based on an 
independent report from the Kuwait Financial Centre S.A.K ‘Markaz’, our GCC Fund 
has been the best performing fund in the region in comparison to its peers for 
two consecutive years 2006 and 2007.” <br>

<br>
<img border="0" src="INVESTING2.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="190" height="248"><b>Changing Dynamics</b><br>
The amendments to the Capital Market Law in the recent years have made the 
capital market in Oman more transparent and well-regulated. This has led to 
increased investments on the stock market. The average daily volume has risen 
from 9 million in 2007 to 17 million in 2008. More liquidity in the market has 
attracted the fence sitters as well. <br>
<br>
These developments have had a positive impact on the mutual fund market. Most of 
the fund managers have reported an increase in the number of investors and the 
fund sizes have grown substantially. Most of the closed funds have become ‘open’ 
to generate more subscriptions for the funds. The fund managers have also 
floated new products focused on real estate and global markets. Says Ali, 
“Recently, we closed our first Real Estate Fund focused on the integrated 
tourism projects sector in Oman with great success. It is too early to speculate 
on the launch of the number of sector specific funds as the market is quite 
small but definitely more and more of them will come in the future. Maybe we 
could see the introduction of Oman based sector specific funds covering entire 
GCC market in the coming years.” <br>
<br>
As is the trend in the regional market, the bulk of the funds comes from 
institutional investors and high net worth individuals but the number of small 
investors is also growing. <br>
Apart from Omani nationals, the expatriate population, especially from Europe, 
Australia and India, are showing a lot of interest in making investments in 
mutual funds market in the Sultanate. Though they repatriate a substantial part 
of their savings to their home countries, the high returns offered by the Omani 
market in the last few years is making them divert a part of their investments 
to the Sultanate.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="INVESTING3.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="190" height="248">Though the fund managers refused to disclose their future offerings but in 
private most of them admitted that they are seriously considering launching lot 
more new products in Oman as well as the GCC market. Kailasam corroborated the 
trend as he said, “All players are in the process of innovating new products 
with the change in the situation. <br>
This is a boon for investors who will have more choice. Mutual funds in Oman are 
also in the process of bringing access to various markets and asset classes 
closer to the Omani investors and also becoming the gateway for the foreign 
investors.” <br>
<br>
<b>Mutual funds vs Direct Investment</b><br>
Though there are always pros and cons when we compare the investments in mutual 
funds and direct investments in stocks but unarguably it is universally accepted 
that mutual funds carry lower risk viz-a-viz direct investments. Globally, there 
are high growth high risk funds as well but Oman based funds are generally 
growth oriented low risk funds. As stated earlier, if you are not a very keen 
follower of stocks and the performance and potential of companies, you should 
avoid investing directly in stocks unless and until you are advised by your 
financial consultant to do so. You may not know which stock to pick and at what 
price to enter and exit to book adequate profits. <br>
<br>
Another advantage of mutual funds is that they give a diversified portfolio with 
even low investments. Generally, a mutual fund has a basket of 30-40 stocks of 
different companies drawn from different sectors. In the basket, some stocks may 
do well and some may not but the overall gains will give decent returns to the 
investor most of the time. Whereas, in the case of stocks, if a stock goes up 
you book profit and if it goes down you book losses. Your interests are highly 
concentrated due to the limited number of stocks you hold.<br>
<br>
If you are looking at rapid gains and getting swayed by the high returns given 
by mutual funds in the last 18 months, you should not look at mutual funds in a 
major way. With the exponential growth in the market in the recent past, the 
expectations of the investors have gone up very high. Most fund managers say 
that if a mutual fund is able to give an annual 15-25 per cent return, it should 
be considered as a good performance and anything above that level should be a 
considered as windfall profits. <br>
<br>
<b>Way Forward</b><br>
The industry players believe that mutual fund market has tremendous potential 
for growth in Oman. But it can happen only if more and more people are attracted 
towards investment in mutual funds. Investors need to be educated to make them 
understand that mutual funds offer good investment opportunity. <br>
<br>
Not many are aware of the handsome returns offered by mutual funds. There is 
also a need to further develop a savings culture in Oman. For small investors, a 
systematic investment planning (SIP) habit needs to be cultivated. For example, 
most of the mutual funds offer a minimum investment of RO100. A prudent small 
investor can invest RO100 every month to build a good asset base for himself in 
the medium to long term. This will give him good returns on his principal 
investment with low risk besides the option of making his assets liquid in case 
of an urgent need for funds. On the market expansion initiatives, Rao adds, “We 
have requested the Capital Market Authority (CMA) to look into the matter of 
reducing the face value of units to 100 baisas from RO1 in order to attract more 
investors into mutual funds. Along with reducing the value, if you fractionalise 
the units, like what you have in the international market, you give the person 
returns closest to the nearest three decimals and it will be more attractive to 
the investor.”<br>
<br>
If the CMA allows that it will open the flood gates for mutual fund investment. 
When the CMA allowed the listed companies to split their shares from RO1 to 100 
baisas, most of the companies opted for this and it led to record trading 
volumes on MSM.<br>
<br>
According to a recent report by Kuwait Financial Centre (“Markaz”), the total 
assets managed by GCC mutual funds under “equity funds” amounts to $21.3 
billion. Of this, Saudi Arabia leads with close to $10 billion worth of assets, 
followed by Kuwait with $6.3 billion. Like Oman, the mutual fund industry in the 
GCC is also expected to expand in the coming years. Research released by Zawya 
Mutual Funds Monitor predicts the growth in the GCC of this industry will reach 
$160 billion by 2010, with Saudi Arabia continuing to have the largest 
concentration of funds. At present, Saudi Arabia has more than 200 listed funds.

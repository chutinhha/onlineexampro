<img border="0" src="MANAGEMENT.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="200" height="269" hspace="5">I think one of the basics of transcultural leadership is empathy,” says 
		Carlos Ghosn, the man who is credited with turning around Nissan, the 
		major Japanese car maker.<br>
		<br>
		“I would say even though the term today is not very popular, love the 
		country and love the culture in which you are in. And try to learn about 
		its strengths – don’t focus on the weaknesses – and make sure that all 
		the people with you are of the same opinion.”<br>
		<br>
		Ghosn, who is the CEO of Renault and Nissan, and the recipient of the 
		2008 INSEAD Transcultural Leadership Award, says the fact he had the 
		experience of being raised in different countries – not by choice, but 
		by coincidence because of his family circumstances – had helped him a 
		lot in life.<br>
		<br>
		Ghosn was born in Brazil to Lebanese parents in 1954. Later, he moved to 
		Beirut where he completed his studies in a Jesuit school. He then 
		graduated with engineering degrees from the Ecole Polytechnique and the 
		Ecole des Mines de Paris, and is today a French citizen. He stresses the 
		importance of cultivating a certain mindset or character that truly 
		enjoys the challenge of living in new environments. “If you have to work 
		and particularly do something significant in a country, it is much 
		easier if somehow you are connected with the country, you like it, you 
		respect its people and <br>
		you are curious about its culture.”<br>
		<br>
		<b>Making a connect</b><br>
		He maintains that this makes a big difference because people in the 
		country working around you may notice whether or not you are connected 
		to the country and are happy to be there; that you are curious and are 
		listening. “Well, they’re going to forgive you a lot of things,” he 
		says. When Ghosn went to Japan, he had some ideas about its culture, he 
		says, such as the language and the food. But he found there were some 
		concepts that were totally new to him – such as walking into an elevator 
		before a woman. He says that while it would be considered “very gross” 
		in a western country, not to do so could be deemed to violate the code 
		of Japanese culture.<br>
		<br>
		While his task was to help revive an icon of the Japanese car industry, 
		he says, the experience wasn’t simply about performing a job – it was 
		about discovering a new culture and it was very rewarding.<br>
		<br>
		“When you have a very diverse team – people of different backgrounds, 
		different culture, different gender, different age – you are going to 
		get a more creative team, probably getting better solutions, and 
		enforcing them in a very innovative way and with a very limited number 
		of preconceived ideas.”<br>
		<br>
		On gender equality, the CEO says that when he started at Nissan, only 
		one per cent of the top management there were women. While that was 
		twice as good as his competitors, he was determined to increase the 
		number of women in management still further. Today, women make up five 
		per cent of management and his objective is to raise that figure to 10 
		per cent.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Pioneering efforts</b><br>
		Ghosn says that although such targets are good, it’s more important to 
		set a lasting, achievable trend for women that proves that diversity 
		delivers. When it comes to sustainability, Ghosn says the Renault-Nissan 
		alliance is aiming to manufacture electric cars. And the market 
		potential is large, with an estimated demand for ten million such 
		vehicles.<br>
		<br>
		Although he likes the concept of vehicles running on hydrogen, Ghosn 
		says that for now he’s sticking with the electric car. “It’s not easy to 
		produce hydrogen and it’s not easy to distribute hydrogen today.”<br>
		<br>
		“So it’s going to take awhile before you can establish a network for the 
		distribution of hydrogen. In the meantime, we are, in a certain way, 
		more ready for electric cars because of the distribution part of it.”<br>
		<br>
		As developing countries become increasingly affluent, more and more 
		people will aspire to own a car. The environmental impact of this can be 
		minimised if the car industry moves toward zero-emission technology, he 
		says.<br>
		<br>
		“All the growth is in the developing markets – China, Russia, India, the 
		Middle East and Brazil. That is where the growth is taking place. And it 
		is normal for a car manufacturer to want to put as many people as 
		possible in cars,” he says. “Now our duty is to ensure that this is 
		sustainable, and that’s why I believe there is a big future for zero 
		emission cars.”<br>
		<br>
		Biofuels have been touted as a possible answer but it’s a solution that 
		may bring its own set of problems, as it may require using land to grow 
		crops for biofuels rather than food. He says no one should have to 
		choose between, say, ethanol for cars and food for people. “You don’t 
		want to be there,” he says. “You want to be in a situation where ethanol 
		for cars is a good complement, and not a competitor, to food for 
		people.”<br>
		<br>
		Can Renault meet its ambitious sales targets for 2009, specially as 
		analysts believe they would involve achieving double-digit growth this 
		year? Ghosn says there’s no point in setting goals that are easily 
		achievable.<br>
		<br>
		“That means your targets are conservative, that’s the only way you can 
		be sure,” he says. “So you want to maintain a certain stretch inside the 
		company, and be innovative and be creative, and find new products and 
		new solutions in order to hit the targets. So it’s risky, but that’s the 
		price to pay for development.” <br>

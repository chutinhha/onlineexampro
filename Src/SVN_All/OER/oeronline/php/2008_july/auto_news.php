        technology and makes for an impressive package. It’s comfortable enough

        Wahiba sands or a holiday trip to Jabel Al Akhdar. The 2008 Ford 
        Explorer is a four-door midsize SUV available in XLT &amp; Eddie Bauer trim 
        levels. The XLT seats seven and comes with 17 inch machined aluminium 
        wheels, cruise control, air-conditioning, a CD/MP3 stereo with an 
        auxiliary input jack and full power accessories. Currently, the Explorer 
        is available on a special offer with 3-years/60,000 km free service 
        (whichever is earlier), free registration and a free gift. <br>

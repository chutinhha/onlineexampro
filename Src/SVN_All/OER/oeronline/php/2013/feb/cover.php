				has Islamic banking got to do with the fiscal budget of Oman? 
				Plenty of good news, would be a fair answer. If you want to run 
				the risk of being labelled a partisan, you could go ahead and 
				add, Islamic banking is a master stroke at the right time by the 
				government. But how does it all add up to the fiscal numbers?<br>
				</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400">The statement by HE 
				Darwish Al Balushi, Minister Responsible for Financial Affairs, 
				while announcing the State Budget for 2013, that the deficit of 
				this year’s budget will partly be financed through issuing 
				development bonds in the market tells us from where it is all 
				coming. Experts say that this will happen in the form of sukuk.<br>
				<br>
				The minister goes on to say that issuance of development bonds 
				will encourage domestic savings and enhance the efficacy of 
				utilising the domestic savings in the local market. The 
				Government is currently considering the sale of some government 
				shares in wholly or partially government owned companies through 
				MSM, which basically means divesting some stake.<br>
				<br>
				The between-the-lines script is that this two-pronged strategy 
				by the government will open up the cash boxes of shariah-compliant 
				unused funds to lap up the development bonds as well as the 
				government divestment stakes. Lo and behold, your Islamic 
				banking is in full play as according to the Islamic banking 
				regulations, shariah-compliant funds cannot be channeled into 
				non-islamic banking operations. It means they need new 
				investment options to generate returns for the millions of rials 
				which will be raised through domestic finances by the Islamic 
				financing institutions. <br>
				<br>
				The sub-plot in this brilliant story is that the government is 
				killing two birds with one stone. Firstly, it is giving a boost 
				to Islamic banking by partly financing its deficit from the 
				local market and secondly the government divestments will 
				stimulate the capital market into enhanced activity and 
				liquidity and encourage new IPOs.</strong></font></span></td>

					Authority (CMA) says, “We hope that the government will come 
					up with new products like sukuk to achieve economic goals 
					like creating a benchmark yield curve for the Omani rial and 
					secondly use the capability of the market to finance the 
					mega projects that are coming up in Sohar, Salalah, Duqm as 
					well as the road and railway infrastructure and other 
					utility projects. That will ease the financing part from the 
					government. Also products like sukuk are definitely required 
					because the Islamic banks as well as regular banks with 
					Islamic banking windows need to utilise their funds 
					somewhere. If sukuk can finance <span class="style14">

					deficit in the budget, the surpluses that are generated from

					<br>
					The government could divest its stake in some industries and 
					downstream oil and gas projects, and even from Omantel in 
					which the government still holds about 70 per cent, says HE 
					Salmi. This will add liquidity and depth to the market which 
					he thinks will give good sentiment to the market. What will 
					really happen is that the proceedings that come from 
					divesting stake could be used to initiate new projects. This 
					would enhance the economy and create new jobs and as a 
					result it will benefit the capital market’s liquidity and 
					add depth to the market and encourage new projects from the 
					private sector.</td>

					<font color="#333333" size="2"><b>Quick look<br>
					</b></font>Some of the key statistics (see table) of the 
					State General Budget 2013 revealed by HE Darwish include a 
					significant -- 29 per cent increase in expenditure to give a 
					fillip to the economy sending a message that the government 
					will not curtail necessary expenditure.<br>
					<br>
					The minister disclosed that the total revenues of the state 
					for the year 2013 were estimated to be about RO11.2bn 
					against RO8.8bn in the budget for the year 2012, with an 
					increase of RO2.4bn, i.e 27 per cent. The oil revenues 
					constitute 84 per cent of total revenues. <br>
					<br>
					The oil revenue has been calculated on the basis of $85 per 
					barrel and a daily production rate of 930,000 barrels, 
					therefore the oil revenues were estimated to be about RO8bn, 
					which represents 72 per cent of the total revenues. The gas 
					revenues, estimated at RO1.3bn, represents 12 per cent of 
					the total revenues.<br>
					<br>
					The non-oil revenues were estimated at about RO1.8bn with an 
					increase of 13 per cent over last year, which represent 16 
					per cent of the total revenues.<br>
					<br>
					There is a seven per cent growth in economy budgeted (same 
					as in 2012) which is higher by one per cent compared to the 
					eighth Five Year Plan annual average GDP growth. <br>
					<br>
					Humayun Kabir, general manager, wholesale banking, National 
					Bank of Oman, says the growth oriented budget reflects the 
					healthy finances of the treasury and a determined effort to 
					keep turning the wheels of the economy in an otherwise 
					globally challenging economic environment. Deficit at 5 per 
					cent of GDP is a tad on the higher side but that may not be 
					an issue if oil prices remain north of $100.”<br>
					<br>
					Although a deficit of RO1.7bn is budgeted, as in the 
					previous years the borrowings are insignificant. Much of the 
					budgeted deficit will be met out of the last year’s surplus 
					and the rest from development bonds. The deficit, although 
					higher than last year’s budget is within acceptable limits – 
					5 per cent of GDP. The minister did clarify that in order to 
					avoid any deficit, the breakeven price for oil should be 
					$104 per barrel as compared to the realised 2012 price of 
					$109 per barrel.<br>
					<br>
					The significant growth in budgeted expenditure has been 
					possible because of the high oil prices, $109 per barrel 
					compared to an average of around $60 per barrel used in 
					preparing the eighth Five-Year Plan.<br>
					<br>
					Defence and security expenditure budget of RO3.5bn is more 
					than double the expenditure estimated in the Five Year Plan 
					(approximately RO1.7bn). The increase in budget for defence 
					and security in 2012 was 57 per cent and in 2013 there is 
					another 38 per cent increase.</td>

					<img border="0" src="images/cover03.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="200" height="176">Ashok Hariharan, partner and head of Tax, Oman &amp; 
					United Arab Emirates, KPMG, says the actual growth in GDP 
					achieved in 2012 is estimated at 8.3 per cent which is 
					higher than the 2012 budgeted growth of 7 per cent. This 
					indicates that despite the global and regional challenges, 
					the Omani government has been able to drive the economy 
					forward. Another encouraging trend is the confinement of 
					inflation in 2012 to three per cent compared to four per 
					cent in 2011. The target inflation rate in the 8th Five-Year 
					Plan is 4 per cent.<br>
					<br>
					According to Hariharan, another indication of growth in the 
					economy is the performance of the MSM listed companies. The 
					Minister Responsible for Financial Affairs mentioned that 
					the performance of companies listed in MSM has increased by 
					18 per cent although the market index rose only by two per 
					cent suggesting that 2013 could be a strong year for 
					equities. The market will also be buoyed by the proposed 
					sale by government of its shares in government owned 
					companies.<br>
					<br>
					“Whilst indications are good for the future particularly if 
					current level of oil prices is maintained, the minister has 
					rightly cautioned for the need to control expenditure within 
					the budgeted amounts. Further he has stressed on the need to 
					reduce subsidies which are quiet large and amount to 
					RO1.3bn,” Hariharan adds.</td>

					Budget, Ali Hamdan Al Raisi, the vice president of the 
					Central Bank of Oman said there are several ways in which 
					the State General Budget for 2013 will benefit the citizens 
					of the Sultanate. “It is expected that the expansionary 
					budget envisaged by the government will help the economy in 
					sustaining a high growth rate. As the benefits of high 
					growth rate percolates downward, the trickle-down effect of 
					the high growth rate will lead to increase in income and 
					spending power of the masses. Moreover, the focus of the 
					Government on creating additional employment for the 
					national workforce through the provision of 56,000 jobs in 
					2013 will benefit the younger generation,” says Raisi(See 
					full interview on page…)<br>
					<br>
					The government is increasingly focussing on its social 
					responsibility by allocating a higher amount of expenditure 
					on education and healthcare. This will benefit the general 
					populace as the educational and healthcare facilities 
					improve in the Sultanate.<br>
					<br>
					The budget is also focussing on attracting local and foreign 
					investment in the private sector, supporting growth of the 
					small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, and setting up new 
					industrial zones. This will lead to further diversification 
					of the economy as envisaged in Long Term Development 
					Strategy Document- Vision 2020.</td>

Organised in association with the Capital Market Authority (CMA), this year marked the third edition of the annual AIWA Awards. Top five best performing companies, based on their performance on select seven financial parameters in 2012 financial year, were felicitated in three different categories – large cap, mid cap and small cap.
						<br />
						<br />
Leading brands in the Sultanate had joined hands with Alam al-Iktisaad Wal A’mal (AIWA), the leading Arabic fortnightly business publication from United Media Services, in bringing the AIWA Awards for Best Performing Companies to life. Bank Sohar was the Strategic Partner for the AIWA Awards. Shell Oman Marketing and Khafeef Oil from Areej Vegetables Oil Company (AVOD) were the support partners for the event. Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC (GBCM) was the knowledge partner whereas KPMG was the validation partner for the ranking process. Times of Oman and Al Shabiba were the media partners.
						
						<br />
						<br />
In the large cap segment, Oman Refreshment Company topped the list of winners. It was followed by four other winners including Raysut Cement, Al Anwar Ceramic Tiles, Bank Sohar and AhliBank. AhliBank made it to the top five of AIWA’s best performing companies in the large cap for the third year in a row.
In the mid cap segment, Dhofar Insurance emerged on top. The other winners in the segment included A’Saffa Foods, Oman Chlorine, Salalah Mills and Oman Orix Leasing. In the small cap category, Dhofar University was placed on the top of winners’ list.

The red carpet awards ceremony at Shangri-La’s Barr Al Jissah Resort & Spa was held in the gracious presence of HE Eng Ahmed Bin Hassan Al Dheeb, Under Secretary, Ministry of Commerce & Industry and HE Abdullah bin Salem bin Abdullah Al Salmi, executive president of Capital Market Authority. It was attended by over 250 industry leaders and senior bureaucrats. The artists from internationally renowned Jam Packed Productions enthralled the audience with their amazing display of a mix of dance and adagio.
<br />
<br />
Ahmed Al Wahaibi, CEO, Oman Oil Co. said: “Everybody has a role to play in creating more job opportunities for the Omanis. Companies should concentrate more on training the employees to meet the changing demands. They have to give training to their employees in Oman instead of sending them outside the country. ”
<br />
<br />
It must be noted that a set of recommendations based on the panel discussions and public opinion at Oman Forum has been submitted to the Minister Responsible for Financial Affairs and the Minister of Commerce & Industry.&#8194;

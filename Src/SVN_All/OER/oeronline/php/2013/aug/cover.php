				The mobile phone, which has become much more than a ubiquitous part of your life, has changed the telecommunications industry landscape inside out and raised the bar for the way network operators and providers have to operate. Now telcos need to put their money where the data is. Visvas Paul D Karra delves deep to find out in which way Oman’s telecom service providers are headed</b>

The Sultanate was recently ranked 32 out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s 2013 Global Competitiveness Report. Based on social and economic factors, the report states that Oman is progressing towards a knowledge and innovation-driven economy using a comprehensive and competitive communications industry, which the WEF says is one of the key drivers for economic growth. Telecom service providers in Oman have lowered the costs of voice and data services and introduced the latest handsets and devices into the market, stimulating progress.<br /><br />

					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">


Another report issued by AREGNET (Arab Regulators Network), states that the broadband service in Oman is amongst the most competitive in the region. The 2012 telecoms retail price benchmarking report for Arab countries also published in March 2013 shows that, in Oman, high usage residential and business broadband packages are being provided at the lowest cost in the region, while mobile broadband in the Sultanate is the second cheapest out of the 22 countries surveyed.
<br />
<br />
The study also shows that broadband in Oman in the 2 Mb/s to 8 Mb/s speed range is ranked most competitive in the region for both business and residential customers as Oman’s telecom network operators have reached an advanced stage where they are able to provide 4G services (see pie chart 1: Broadband subscribers – Proportion by Speed-Q1, 2013). The high rating shows that there has been a huge drop in tariffs, as well as nearly twice as many service options since the last report in 2010.
<br />
<br />
All this seems to be laudable news but falls short of a standing ovation because these developments have come at a cost for the telecom operators in the Sultanate. While the country may figure among the top in the rankings table, the inside story has been all about keeping the mast flying high despite the turbulence that is threatening the sector. A decline in revenues from the traditional services such as land lines, voice and SMS; intense competition due to number of players; higher costs of human resources; and ever changing technologies have all scripted an edge of the seat “plot” for telecommunications executives who are biting their nails in anticipation of what’s next even before they have completely surmounted the present challenges.
<br />
<br />

					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
 According to a report by Business Monitor International (BMI) in May, 2013, while there are a number of positives, the Sultanate’s market is limited by the small population size and is approaching saturation for some services, notably voice (fixed and mobile) services because of which operators have shifted their strategy towards up-selling higher-value services like broadband to existing customers in order to sustain revenue growth.
<br />
<br />
According to the BMI report, mobile subscriptions increased by 9.7 per cent in 2012 to reach a total of 5.278mn and a penetration of 181.7 per cent (which has now been revised to less than 150 per cent due to changes in population figures). The TRA data show 3G subscriptions grew by 12.7 per cent to bring total growth in 2012 to 48 per cent. Operator data show monthly blended mobile ARPU (average revenue per user) continued to decline, with the market average down by 7.6 per cent year-on-year to RO8.4 in the fourth quarter of 2012 (see chart 2: ARPUs).
<br />
<br />
<strong>Game changers
</strong>
<br />
Data seems to be headline for every telecommunications provider because of the changing social mores, wherein people want to remain “connected” to one another more than ever not just with making a simple voice call on the phone but also through various social media applications found on the internet. If you observe the promotions or the catchy advertisements that appear across all media, the message has shifted from luring customers with offers of lower call prices and more-for-less on voice rates etc to faster and better quality of internet and data services (see charts on broadband packages of various telcos).
<br />
<br />
“The services which all of us (telecom players) have seen go down significantly since the last few three or four years are the classical services like the landline phones, SMS etc. That’s only because people have started to use new age services like Blackberry messenger (BBM) and internet-based services like Viber, Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter etc all of which are normally data based,” says Joakim Klingefjord, CEO, Majan Telecommunications (renna mobile).
<br />
<br />
The new services all sit on top of smart phones, tablet computers like iPad and other personal digital assistants (PDAs). Industry experts believe that these smart phone devices are the game-changers and the catalyst for this are internet services like YouTube, social media and other internet applications. “Actually what the smart phone relies on is an internet access and this is where the growth is and that’s where the demand for broadband is coming from,” says Klingefjord.<br />
<br />
<br />
According to Dr Amer Rawas, CEO of Omantel, the data usage (internet) for Omantel network grew tenfold in the past three years but the revenues have not grown correspondingly (see chart on Internet Services). This has happened because there has been an erosion of values as a result of the revenue model adopted by over-the-head players like YouTube whose revenue model is advertising. “The more people use YouTube, the more advertising benefits it gets but even though it is using Omantel pipe (network), I am not able to capture that benefit because of the pricing structure I have adopted like having flat rates for broadband and so on,” Dr Rawas adds.And he says that its not just Oman but the global telecom industry which is suffering due to resource-hungry applications like YouTube and other social media.
<br />
<br /><center><img src="images/cover_4.jpg" border="0"></center>
					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">

A mobile reseller like FRiENDi is however on a different wavelength, seeing the demand for broadband as the proverbial goose with the golden egg. For FRiENDi, more data users means more good news. “We were the first in the pre-paid mobile market to launch a monthly data plan for internet users. This has changed the way the cost-conscious consumers used their mobile phones and since then, it has caught on very well in our target group and we see that this trend will continue,” says Martin Glud, CEO, FRiENDi Oman, Connect Arabia.
<br />
<br />
“I believe there is still room to improve your services and as internet usage increases the networks will get upgraded and more data capacity will continue to roll out. And that will be an obvious area where we can grow ourselves because the idea is to get even more customers through our unique services and products,” he adds.

<strong>Highly fragmented market
</strong><br />
Before we go any further, it has to be realised that the telecommunications sector in the Sultanate is complex due to the high market segmentation caused by the total number of players (six) who are operating or will be operating in a country which has a population of just over 3.8 million. While the mobile telephony penetration rate is around 145 per cent, the fixed line penetration is just a minuscule fraction of that.
<br />
<br />
Five years ago a lot of excitement was generated by five mobile re-sellers (also known as MVNOs globally) who obtained class II licenses for resale of basic mobile services. The entry of Arabia Connect (FRiENDi Mobile), Injaz International (Apna Mobile), Kalam Telecommunications (later backed out and its license was awarded to an Omani company, Samatel), Majan Telecom (renna), and Mazoon Mobile meant that Oman’s mobile telephony market became highly segmentised.
<br />
<br />
To add to the fragmentation, Oman’s telecom watchdog, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, in November 2008 went ahead and granted the second integrated fixed line telecommunications licence (Class I) in the Sultanate to the Nawras consortium thus ending state-monopoly on the telecommunications sector.
<br />
<br />
A third Class I licence was granted in November 2012 to a consortium consisting of Awaser Oman Co and Hong Kong-based telco, PCCW International, to provide fixed-line voice and data services exclusively in the Governorate of Muscat for 25 years.
<br />
<br />
Presently, Omantel, Nawras, FRiENDi, renna and Samatel are actively operating in the country with various products and services.

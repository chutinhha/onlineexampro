					HE Salah al Ma’awali, the director general of SMEs Development at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry points out that the decision to raise the minimum wages for Omanis to RO325 will not affect the SMEs that have limited number of staff as compared to major companies. The initiative will have a positive impact on the morale of workers and enhance their productivity, he tells Khalfan al Rahbi, editor-in-chief, Alam al Iktisaad Wal Amal. Excerpts from the interview:<br /><br />
					Don’t you believe that the decision will affect the SMEs especially as it comes on the heels of the SMEs symposium which discussed the challenges facing the sector?
					</b>
					<br />
					The decision is good as it will support the efforts made to make the private sector attractive for the Omani workforce. It will contribute to the stability of the manpower in the sector. The decision will not affect the small enterprises because the number of workers there is less compared to major companies. We encourage these enterprises to manage their affairs and involve members of the family and friends. This will help in making them owners and businessmen. On the other hand, they need not pay big amounts of money as salaries. We should also take into account that when you give the employees good salary, the productivity and loyalty to the company will increase. 
					<br />
					<br />
<b>					How can we alleviate the impact on SMEs?
</b>					
<br />

Many measures were taken to alleviate the impact on SMEs. Dedication of 10 per cent of the projects offered by the Tender Board to SMES and granting 10 per cent of the contracts of the major companies to SMEs are just few examples of the support provided to this sector. The SMEs should do their best to draw benefits from the support provided to them. SMEs may also get finance from the available funding resources which are well poised to help the sector. 
<br />
<br />

<b>Do you feel that the timing of the decisions is appropriate?</b>
<br />
Many studies were conducted and meeting among stakeholders were held before taking this decision. There is a grace period as the decision will be implemented from July 2013. We believe that this grace period is enough for the enterprises to settle their conditions and adjust themselves with the effects of the decision.
<br /><br />

<b>Have you received any response from SMEs after the decision was made?</b>
<br />
Yes, we have received many responses expressing their unhappiness over the decision. I believe that these responses were natural as they will affect the profit margins. On the other hand, workers were happy with the decision. To address the issue we will provide SMEs with some incentives. 
In general, I believe that the decision will have positive impact on the performance of these enterprises as it will raise the purchasing power of workers as well as their spending power. To have a clear picture, we should think of the pros and cons.

				The government has committed to hire 100,000 employees from 2011 to 2013. If you take an average of 37,000 job seekers per year, it touches 110,000 employees for three years. Out of these 110,000, almost 50 per cent has been appointed just for the sake of absorbing the numbers. If the salary of an entry level job in military is RO500 per month, it will be RO6000 per year for each employee; the salary for 50,000 people is RO300mn. Then you have to give additional increment and the annual increment. If you take all this into account for the next 20 years it goes to RO7.5bn.<br />
				<br />
				Rather than paying RO7.5bn in the government sector, the government could have appointed 100,000 in the private sector by absorbing RO150 per month out of the total RO350 minimum wages. The rest of the money could be paid by the private sector. The impact of this is RO180mn per year. For the next five years, suppose if they had absorbed this cost, it would be only RO900mn. But today, many people are reluctant to join the private sector because they are expecting a higher paying job in the government. If the government jobs would have not been available, it would have been much easier for the unemployed to accept RO350 from the private sector itself.

				The Al Rafd Fund will bring together the existing funds, including ‘Sanad’ Fund for supporting the small and medium-sized enterprises, Livelihood Development Programme, supervised by the Ministry of Social Development, Fisheries Fund, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and Youth Fund and the Fund for Rural Women.
				<br /><br />
				
These funds have been put under Al Rafd Fund, and ‘Sanad’ Programme will continue as it is but under the umbrella of the Al Rafd Fund, and will work within the programme of the new Al Rafd Fund. The fund, at the beginning, will target groups belonging to the social security, as well as for rural women, professionals and craftsmen, in addition to other categories, such as categories of entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises.
<br />
<br />
This fund will have a great link to an important decision taken by the symposium on the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. His Majesty the Sultan has approved  the establishment of an institution for SME development which will provide advice and financial, administrative and  technical support for the small and medium sized enterprises and this fund will be supporting these institutions.

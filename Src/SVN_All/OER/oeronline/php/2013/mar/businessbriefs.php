						Al Sulaimi group announced its collaboration with AquaSwiss of Switzerland to bring unique desalination technologies to provide low cost water solutions in Oman. <br />This collaboration model will bring unique desalination technologies such as waste heat-driven, low-temperature Multi Effect Distillation ( MED), industry’s first zero chemical consumption and low OPEX Green RO, low electricity consumption Mechanical Vapor Compression ( MVC) units. Further important to note is that all these technologies are “red tide resistant”, unlike the conventional Reverse Osmosis plants in Oman.<br /><br /> The highlight of the collaboration is to leverage state-of-the-art fabrication, workshop and integration facilities of Al Sulaimi with a strong focus on using Omani component and technology sharing with Omani institutions. <br /><br />“We are proud through this collaboration to bring world’s leading desalination technologies into the country in a way that the majority portions of these desalination plants can be manufactured in Oman using Omani resources delivering water at per-unit costs that are lowest in the world” said Hamed Al Sulaimi, chairman of the Al Sulaimi group.

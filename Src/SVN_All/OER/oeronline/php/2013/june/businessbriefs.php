Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) signed two major contacts recently as part of its In-Country Value (ICV) drive to boost Omani business and to create increased employment opportunities in the Sultanate. A $40mn contract was signed with Al Baraka Oilfield Services, one of its Super Local Community Contractors (SLCCs) to carry out the replacement and maintenance of flowlines in Bahja in the southern part of PDO’s concession area. The two-year deal, which has a one-year extension option, was signed by PDO managing director Raoul Restucci and Sheikh Ghanim bin Dhahir bin Hilal al Bathari, chairman of the board of directors at Al Baraka Oilfield Services. “Al Baraka is an Omani company which has demonstrated that it is capable of delivering major oilfield projects to a high safety and technical standard. We are determined to sustain this and other SLCC partnerships to create job and training opportunities and help build up the capacity and capability of local businesses,” said Restucci. In another major development, a $30mn contract has been signed with Schlumberger, a leading international oilfield services company, which will increase the amount of Omani-made materials used in the oil and gas sector. The five-year deal covers the provision, manufacturing and reconditioning of completions and gas lift equipment and accessories used to extract hydrocarbons with Schlumberger committed to supporting local manufacturers to develop the capability to supply the orders.  </td>

				Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQ) group CEO Andrew Stevens recently hosted the inaugural monthly meeting of the chief executives of CBQ’s alliance banks, designed to identify and discuss the best way to deliver benefits to customers and shareholders from the emerging network. Stevens was joined at the meeting in Istanbul by Salaam Al Shaksy, CEO of the National Bank of Oman, and Paul Trowbridge, CEO of United Arab Bank. The three current alliance members were also joined by soon-to-be member and special guest Hamit Aydogan, CEO of the Alternatifbank of Turkey. In March 2013, Commercial Bank announced its intention to acquire a 70.84 per cent stake in Alternatifbank. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory approval, and upon completion, will broaden the alliance to four banks with a geographic reach from Istanbul to Oman. The meeting addressed increasing trade and investment links between the regions, and looked at how the alliance of banks could benefit their customers and facilitate trade and investment developments.

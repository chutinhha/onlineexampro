					In a pact that employs creativity and a variety of media to cut down the number of road accidents and fatalities in the country, Oman LNG and Oman Road Safety Association (ORSA), entered into an agreement to highlight the debilitating effects of bad habits on the roads using short animated films. The signing of the pact was also the springboard for the launch of the Oman LNG's road safety mascot. While the National Centre for Statistics and Information (NSCI) recently reported a significant drop in the number of road accidents in Oman, stakeholders hold the view that more can still be done to curb the menace of road accidents and fatalities that plague citizens and residents. The short animated films to run for thirty seconds at a time is focused on a set of twins – Shama'a and Mishal – as central characters who find themselves in various scenarios that in the end provide lessons and morals about safety on roads.

							<span class="style23">Broadband and voice service costs in Oman are amongst the most competitive in the region, according to an independent report issued by AREGNET, the Arab world communications regulatory network. The 2012 telecoms retail price benchmarking report for Arab countries published in March 2013 shows that high usage residential and business broadband packages in Oman are provided for the lowest cost in the region, while mobile broadband in the Sultanate is the second cheapest out of the 22 countries surveyed. The study also shows that broadband in Oman in the 2 Mb/s to 8 Mb/s speed range is ranked most competitive in the region for both business and residential customers. The high rating shows that there has been a huge drop in tariffs, as well as nearly twice as many service options since the last report in 2010. The recent launch of 4G services in the Sultanate has further enhanced broadband competiveness and taken communications in the country to the next level. This jump in technology took place after the report had been researched; and Oman is likely to score even higher in the 2013 results.</span></td>

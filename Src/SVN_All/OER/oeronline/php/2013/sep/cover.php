				Oman's healthcare landscape is riding the crest of a qualitative change driven by a plethora of initiatives both in the public and private sectors. The government is focusing on improving tertiary healthcare facilities by developing specialised hospitals and medical cities while private operators are upgrading their services by foraying into super specialty and tertiary services across the country. A report by MuhammedNafie</b>

The reminiscences of two hospitals in the capital area with a total of one dozen beds and staffed by a handful of physicians and nurses, and ten tiny ill-equipped clinics scattered across the interiors, serving the healthcare requirements of the entire population of the Sultanate in 1970 are still vivid in the living memory of many Omanis. Some elderly people could dig out from their old documents a handwritten prescription by the legendary Dr Wells Thoms who served at the erstwhile American Mission Hospital in Muttrah which was later rechristened as Al Rahma, or a medical report prepared by his immediate successor, Dr Donald Taeke Bosch who later helped to incorporate those hospitals into the new Ministry of Health (MoH) hospital programme.

					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">


Now, forty odd years since the country's tryst with Renaissance which also marked the beginning of Oman's massive public health infrastructure development, the Sultanate is home to 65 hospitals with a total number of 5,859 beds and 1,143 health centres both in the public and private sectors (See box: Healthcare at a glance). The rising lifespan is a telling indicator of how far Oman's healthcare sector has come of age. The average life expectancy at birth stands now at more than 72 years, a long way up from only 49 years in 1970. Another tangible result of this incredible development story has been the total eradication of communicable diseases such as measles, malaria and typhoid. As the Minster of Health HE Dr Ahmed Bin Mohammed Al Saéedi recently pointed out, under-five mortality rate has dropped from 35 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 11.9 in 2011. Infant mortality rate has also dropped from 29 to 9.5 deaths for every 1,000 live births. With 19 doctors per 10,000 people, as against the global average of 14 doctors, and spending on healthcare 4.9 per cent of the total government expenditure (the budgetary allocation for healthcare sector in 2013 was RO547mn), Oman is expected to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Furthermore, the country's healthcare market is projected to be worth over $2bn by 2015 and the total expenditure of the healthcare sector in 2013 is approximately 5 per cent of the total public expenditure, rising to $1.4bn from $1.3bn in 2012.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Getting a facelift
</strong>
<br />
<br/>

Even though all these indicators which present a rosy picture of the overall growth of the sector over a period, there has been a constant mismatch between the increasing healthcare demands of a growing population and the capacity of the existing facilities to provide quality services, especially when it comes to advanced secondary and tertiary care. Despite having achieved much, the country's healthcare facilities, counted in 2000 among the top ten of the world's most effective healthcare systems by World Health Organisation (WHO), are now faced with a set of new challenges. Presently, 38 per cent of Oman's population is under 15 years, which will undergo a drastic demographic change in the coming decades. In addition, several non-communicable diseases triggered by the sedentary lifestyle and higher calorie intake have posed a new threat to public health. According to MoH, roughly 15 per cent of the population suffers from diabetes while 25 per cent is clinically obese. Although primary and extended healthcare centres and dispensaries distributed throughout the country are capable of providing primary health services, and numerous regional and sub-regional hospitals offer a wide array of secondary services (both ambulatory and in-patient) in fields as diverse as general medicine and general surgery, cardiology, and obstetrics and gynaecology, they are not sufficient enough to accommodate the healthcare requirements of all the citizens. In addition, the number of hospitals that can offer quality tertiary care services is abysmally low. Only four national referral hospitals – Royal Hospital, Khoula Hospital, IbnSina Hospital and Al Nadha Hospital – and Sultan Qaboos Hospital, to a limited extent, can offer such advanced services. The waiting time for an appointment can extend to months, resulting in patients not getting treatment on time and being at times forced to go abroad. While returning from one of the interviews for this report, this correspondent met with a road accident and, having sustained some minor injuries on head which bled profusely, was rushed to a nearby hospital in an ambulance. But at the overly busy emergency ward of the hospital, he had to wait for more than one hour unattended by any doctor, until he eventually pleaded to a passing-by doctor to get his wounds dressed. Fortunately enough, he had received some first aids by the exemplary medical staff of the Royal Oman Police at the ambulance. It was a firsthand experience of how the existing healthcare facilities are hard-pressed to meet the increasing demand.
<br />
<br />
It all points to the fact that Oman's healthcare sector is in the dire need of quantitative expansion and qualitative development and upgradation. In order to cope with the changing dynamics, the government has devised several short term strategies and a long-term master plan called Health Vision 2050, which aims at radically improving the healthcare facilities in the country. Increased government spending is poised to usher in substantial improvement in government facilities by developing specialised hospitals and large medical cities. As part of a short term strategy, the government aims to have 346 government healthcare facilities including 70 hospitals and a medical city by the end of 2015. The 723-bed, five-storey Sultan Qaboos Hospital in Salalah, which is under construction from 2012, will include facilities for paediatric emergency services, general medicine and surgery, orthopaedics, psychiatry, neurosurgery and radiology. Another major public hospital which is currently at the planning stage is the proposed Muscat General Hospital to be set up near Muscat International Airport. Fiscal provision for this project has been made in the current eighth five-year plan. Some of the recent government initiatives to set up tertiary facilities include the National Diabetes and Endocrine Centre which serves as a one-stop clinic for diabetic patients and the National Genetics Centre at Muscat's Bausher Polyclinic complex, designed to provide a host of genetic services, including genetic medicine, genetic counselling and genetic health education. MoH's massive upcoming projects include the $1.8bn Medical City coming up in Barka, which is currently at the design stage. The Ministry has already started a field study for the 500-hectare project in the Wilayat of Barka. The complex will have more than 2,000 beds combined, integrating five specialist tertiary hospitals.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Private sector advantage
</strong>
<br />
<br />
Till recently Oman's healthcare industry has been characterised by low private sector penetration. For example, in 1995 the country had only one private hospital with a total of six beds. But during the last few years, the private health landscape has undergone a tremendous metamorphosis with a lot of players coming in, and the sector is continuing to expand as a result of strong government incentives. During the last five years there has been a surge in the number of private players, intensifying competition in the market and forcing the operators to improve quality and upgrade services.
<br/>
<br/>
Opening a new chapter in Oman's healthcare development will be the upcoming International Medical City project in Salalah which is expected to open in 2016. Spearheaded by the Saudi-based Apex Medical Group (AMG), the $1bn facility will house a multispecialty tertiary care hospital and three medical centres of excellence for organ transplant, rehabilitation and diagnostics. AMG has concluded the final stages of design for the project with the recent completion of infrastructure planning. The first phase of the project – planned to be finished in 2016 – will see the completion of a healthcare complex comprising a 250-bed multi-speciality tertiary care hospital. The second phase includes a healthcare resort combined with a four-star medical hotel, residential quarters for faculty and staff, serviced apartments for clients, and commercial components. The third phase will focus on the development of a medical education complex and an R&D centre. Testifying to the strong government backing for the project are the allocation of the 870,000 sqmetre plot by the Ministry of Tourism and the support of MoH as a strategic partner.

Anyone watching the latest trends in the industry can understand that a lot of newcomers are scrambling for a bigger slice of Oman's private healthcare pie and the sector is, ipso facto, undergoing a qualitative shift. As observed by K Jayan, director of UK-based Starcare Health Systems which runs Starcare hospital in Oman, there has been a shift from volume based business to quality based operation. "The healthcare sector in the Sultanate is in a phase of transformation with increasing participation from the private sector and unprecedented demand for quality healthcare," says Jayan who has the rich experience of commissioning three hospitals and six medical centres in Oman in a short span of time. "Although there is an increase in the number of private hospitals and polyclinics, people are looking for more quality operators who can provide advanced secondary and tertiary care services. There is still a huge gap and a lot of potential to tap in that area. When we studied the market before Starcare started operation in 2011, we identified a huge opportunity in quality healthcare services. That is why we positioned ourselves as a premium level but affordable hospital." Starcare is a 50-bed multispecialty hospital offering over 35 specialty services. The hospital has completed the project in lesser than a year and got the accreditation of US-based Joint Commission International in a short span of 342 days of its operation. Jayan also discloses that Starcare is planning to come up with a 250-bed tertiary care facility – Starcare National Hospital at an estimated investment of RO25mn which will be commissioned by 2015. This is in addition to various other projects in pipeline including a budget/economy brand called Safecare targeting middle class families, modelling on its recent venture in the Indian state of Rajastan.
</p>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br />
Jayan avers that some years ago, the demand for private care was so high that those who were coming to do business in Oman were more preoccupied with bottom line than other criteria. "But they have contributed too. But now things have changed considerably because for the last four years there is a perception that quality healthcare matters. Now people have more choices and everyone is quality-conscious. When we got JCI accreditation, the support and appreciation including from MoH was significant. In this regard, we fondly recollect the visit by the Minister of Health to our facility apart from other esteemed guests like ambassadors, high-ranking officials and top businessmen. The initiatives of the MoH in ensuring the quality of private healthcare providers in the recent years have been commendable."
</p>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br/>
Another private hospital which got JCI accreditation in the Sultanate is Muscat Private Hospital (MPH), a 72-bed facility launched in 2000 which is so far arguably the single largest facility in the private sector.</p>

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br/>
Dr Benny Panakkal, medical director, Badr Al Sama Group of Hospitals, thinks that Oman's private sector healthcare is going through a transitional stage wherein competition has not only enhanced the quality of services but also helped increase people's awareness about healthcare and make them more health conscious. He says Badr Al Sama which started operation in Ruwi in October 2002 as a clinic was the first private clinic in the country to offer round-the-clock services. Later evolved into a full-fledged hospital, Badr Al Sama offers various specialty and super specialty services such as cardiology, nephrology, gastroenterology, intensive coronary unit and dialysis etc. The latest introduction is a state-of-the-art Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory (CATH LAB) which offers coronary angiogram and angioplasty services. Referring to the increasing demand in Oman for such treatments, DrPanakkal, himself a cardiologist who started the cardiology department in the hospital way back in 2003, says within two weeks of installing the services, the hospital has done six angioplasties and more than 10 coronary angiograms. "I think we are the first hospital in the private sector to start several advanced services such as dialysis, three dimensional echocardiography, stress echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiogram," he adds. Now with hospitals and polyclinics distributed in eight localities across the length and breadth of the country, Badr Al Sama Group is the largest provider of healthcare services in the private sector in Oman.</p>

Another interesting development in the private sector was the recent launch of Sugar Clinic, a state-of-the-art super specialty facility for diabetes treatment by Apollo Hospital Group. Talking about the rising burden of chronic lifestyle diseases in Oman, V T Saileswaran, managing director of Apollo Medical Centre in Oman, states that the prevalence of diabetes amongst adults is 12.5 per cent while hypertension is as high as 40 per cent. He added that the group is committed to strengthen the Sugar Clinic initiative in Oman as it plans to add more such clinics over the next 12 to 18 months. India-based Apollo Group forayed into Omani market six years ago by setting up Apollo Medical Centre. The centre was largely aimed at providing primary care services while acting as a follow-up facility for patients availing care at the various Apollo facilities abroad.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><img src="images/coverstory/abilash.jpg"></center>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br/>
Sharing about the future plans, Apollo Group's representative and head of operations in Oman, AbhilashPillai mentioned about the long association the group shares with the people of Oman. He added the group is currently in the process of assessing and evaluating the various healthcare opportunities in the geography. "Sugar Clinic is a complete integrated solution to manage diabetes and offers customised solution to individuals availing diabetes care," adds Pillai. "The centre offers a wide array of services such as specialist consultation, end-to-end diagnostics, general podiatry and diabetes wound care center, footwear store, exercise advice/ prescription by a trained physiotherapist, pre- diabetes screening and management programme, diabetes education, diabetes foot clinic- screening, risk assessment and treatment, diabetes eye clinic equipped with state-of- the- art non-Mydriatic fundus camera, insulin pump clinic, diet and nutrition clinic and pharmacy."</p>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br/>
Pillai exudes confidence that due to a host of reforms and initiatives undertaken by MoH, private and public sector health establishments in Oman will be capable of catering to most of the country's healthcare needs in about three to five years' time. </p>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br/>
Al Raffah Hospital from DrMoopen's Group started operation in Oman with medical centres at various locations in the Al Batinah region. Currently the group has two hospitals and one medical centre, in addition to a clinic at Omantel headquarters in Seeb. Furthermore, a new medical centre in Amerat is all set for operation and another one in Al Khoud is expected to open by November, while a hospital project in Nizwa is in the pipeline.</p>

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br/>
"In Oman there are both premium level hospitals and low-end facilities; therefore we are positioning ourselves somewhere in the middle targeting the middle-income to low-income people who can avail our facilities," says its chief operating officer SeeniyaBiju. "We started with specialist doctors and seeing the requirements of the public, we moved on into a super specialty hospital. Right now, we have most of the super specialties like gastroenterology, laparoscopic surgery, urology, cardiology etc. As we see people consider us as a critical care centre, we are in the process of adding more super specialties such as neurology and nephrology."</p>

In another major development, India-based NOVA Medical Centres, which in partnership with Omzest group of companies started its first Middle East operation in March 2012 by opening a polyclinic in Al Khuwair, is all set to launch a unique short-stay surgical centre. "It will be called a short-stay surgical centre where people will come for surgery, get operated and stay minimally in the hospital," says Dr (Col) KM Harikrishnan, general manager of operations and senior consultant. "It will be a state-of-the-art surgical facility where we will provide all advanced services. It is being set up as a joint venture between NOVA and OMZEST Group of companies. Through this unique facility, we are looking to reduce the cost of surgical treatment. We believe that the longer the patient stays in the hospital, the higher will be the cost both for the patient and for the organisation. We have already got the preliminary approval from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Housing and the construction is going to start very soon. And we expect that we will be up and running in 18 months. We plan to bring all the top-class tertiary level medical health available to us on a regular basis. We will also be inviting local Omani and expatriate doctors in senior positions to come and utilise our facilities so that they can offer tertiary care services which they are currently providing in the government services."</p>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br/>
The existing facility of NOVA offers a lot of super specialty services such as general surgery, laparoscopic surgery, internal medicine, paediatrics, gynecology, ENT, cardiology, radiology, dermatology, family physicians, general practice etc. Recently NOVA has tied up with Eurosleep, a Europe-based sleep disorder management set-up. "In addition, we have put in place a new concept called 'sleep clinic' which will be a unique set-up for assessing people at home without disturbing them. We will evaluate them at the comfort zone of their bed with equipment attached to them; and the next day the analysis will tell us what their sleep disorder is," says DrHarikrishnan. </p>

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br />
DrHoussam Ahmed Akoum, who recently took charge as the chief operating officer of KIMS Oman Hospital, feels that Oman has a long way to go towards improving the quality and enhancing the efficiency of services on a par with other countries in the GCC region. "There is no denying the fact that government has done a brilliant job in laying the foundation of a solid healthcare sector by investing heavily on setting up infrastructure", he says. "But the level of health consciousness among the public is very limited. We need to inculcate a health culture in the society. People need to be constantly alerted about serious health issues in order to make them health conscious." DrAkoum thinks that compared to Saudi Arabia, where he worked for a long time as a senior consultant, Oman's private sector industry is still in a bourgeoning stage and the market is very small. "Therefore there is still a huge potential to tap, for the private operators if they are ready to meet the challenges head on." KIMS Oman, an initiative by Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), is a multi-specialty hospital with state-of-the art facilities. Located in Darsait, this 56-bed facility offers services in almost all specialties such as cardiology, orthopaedics, neurology, general medicine, urology, paediatrics, general surgery, dermatology, endocrinology, ENT, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, anesthesiology, family medicine, plastic and cosmetic surgery, dentistry etc. DrAkoum informs that KIMS is planning to expand the existing facility to 75 to 80-bed hospital.</p>

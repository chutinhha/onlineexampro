<b> Green habitat from waste water
</b><br />
<br />
BAUER Nimr has constructed 360 hectares of wetlands promoting new habitat generation and enhancing biodiversity by converting waste water produced in oil fields

BAUER Nimr’s goal was to successfully treat water produced from the Nimr oil fields and utilise it for wetlands to degrade hydrocarbons, resulting in clean industrial grade water and creating a sustainable environment for a new green habitat and biodiversity.

<br />
<br />
 The water treatment has proven successful both in terms of treatment efficiency and in-country value generation through oil recovery and reduced energy costs for PDO. The constructed wetland can be seen as an innovative approach to treat produced water i.e. polish the water through degradation of hydrocarbon content. During construction of the wetland system and alongside operation, BAUER Nimr’s wetland competence centre and environmental research unit made comprehensive studies and analysis to ensure the promotion of a sustainable green habitat. Since stepping into operation, the company registered more than 104 migratory bird species that are new to this valuable habitat. In addition plant, fishes and algae were identified around the site. The team of experts found out that because of the introduction of local plant species, local fish species have been observed in large numbers in the lower levels of the wetland system, balancing the ecosystem; and different types of algae have occurred naturally in the wetland system allowing for breeding/hiding places for aquatic animals and valuable microorganisms.
 
<br />
<br />
<b> A veritable green school
</b><br />
<br />
 Ras Al Hamra International School which is currently being built by PDO has several inbuilt green building features enabling it to conform to the school rating system requirements of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an international agency
<br />
<br /> 
Ras Al Hamra Development Project has incorporated several state-of-the-art green features into its new international school which will be the first school in Oman certified by LEED (leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), an internationally recognised rating system for the design, construction and operation of high performance green buildings, homes and neighbourhoods.
A number of main LEED methods and principles were applied in the design and construction of the school such as intelligent and sustainable design, incorporation of energy efficient methods, minimising water consumption and using treated water, less natural resources and rapidly renewable and recycled materials etc. The learning environment of the school will have high daylight ratio, a higher supply of fresh air and more efficient toilet and recycled water supply systems. Everything about the fabric of the building is about energy efficiency. Environmentally conscious thinking is at the forefront of the redevelopment with the alignment of new buildings taking into account the sun’s trajectory to enable solar-powered streetlight and hot water systems. The new school will also incorporate all sustainable features into current IPC curriculum which also addresses sustainable/ environmental awareness lessons and tools. Sustainable curriculum will be further expanded into detailed curriculum lessons covering all age groups/ grades.

<b>Replenishing marine life
</b><br />
<br />
 As part of a CSR initiative by The Wave, Muscat, environmentally-friendly reef balls will be dropped to the sea bed in carefully selected areas at Seeb and Bausher to attract marine life
 
<br />
<br />
 Empower Fishermen Community is a sustainability- driven CSR initiative designed by The Wave, Oman in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MoAF). The initiative is aimed at empowering Muscat’s long-established fishing community, an industry which is an integral part of the city’s heritage, through three major segments: community support, economic support and improving environmental standards and awareness.
 
<br />
<br />
 The community support segment of the project provides the latest fishing equipment and tools to the community to assist the fishermen in their work. Funding for fishermen will also be allocated to build better facilities, such as shelters for their boats and equipment.
 
<br />
<br /> 
The economic support segment offers business training programmes to the fishing community. These courses will focus on core skills including business planning and finance, aiming to help fishermen work together to establish and grow their businesses.

<br />
<br />
In the environmental segment ‘reef balls’ – pyramid-shaped structures designed to withstand the force of the ocean but remaining environmentally friendly – will be dropped to the sea bed in carefully selected areas at Seeb and Bausher, where they will attract marine life. Reef balls contribute greatly to rehabilitating coral reefs, replenishing marine life and even protecting the unique ecosystems of mangrove forests which are found in Oman.

 <b>Green foliage</b>
<br />
<br />
 Muscat Hills Golf & Country Club is a truly unique golf development, comprising an 18-hole PGA-certified green golf course and a high-quality residential development on the outskirts of Muscat. Built in a distinct corner of Muscat’s rugged hills and etched by canyon-like wadis, the course boasts tremendous views over the Al Hajar Mountains with the Muscat Sea in the distance. Muscat Hills Golf & Country Club compliment the 18-hole golf course with excellent practice facilities including two putting greens, a large chipping green and state-of-the-art driving range in which golfers can practice their golf game from both ends of the driving range. The par-72, 18-hole golf course is the first grass golf course in Oman. The golf course was the cherished dream of HH Kais al Said. Now the project is followed on by his son HH Rawy Al Said who continues the commitment to the project and residential estate. 
<br />
<br />
 The project sought to achieve a green golf course over the 45 hectare project, and provide green foliage to Muscat Hills and nature habitat. The project also made effective steps towards reducing water consumption and chemical applications. Muscat Hills has measured the success of the project by monitoring water consumption and chemical usage on a daily basis. The company continues to evolve and look for water conservation measures. The development of the project is expected to continue with the clubhouse development and hotel project.

<b>Natural infill
</b><br />
<br />
Green Cover has explored the possibility of eco-friendly stadiums in the Middle East, introducing natural infill materials in artificial grass instead of chemical materials

<br />
<br />
 Green Cover has introduced unique natural infill materials for use in artificial grass instead of employing chemical infill materials at its various stadium projects in Oman and UAE. The natural infill gives eco- friendly natural feeling to the players and makes the stadium look always fresh and tidy. It gives a natural feeling and there will be no smell of rubber in the hot climate. The project is cost-effective as no water or fertliser is required and it is not labour oriented too. In addition, there is no carbon emission because of natural infill. Weekly moistening the infill will be giving the added advantage of lifetime up to 15 to 20 years.
 
<br />
<br />
 After constant research, the company has found out that the natural infill product became the most favoured infill for the football stadium across the region and the initiative was received well among the sports people. The composition of this product revolutionises the infill method for an artificial turf field. This natural infill can be recycled for agricultural use when the artificial turf comes to the end of its life. As an organic infill of plant origin, it is odourless and microorganism proof. It has characteristics to keep the median temperature of the synthetic turf lower than a rubber infill, very much like a natural grass temperature. The company is looking at doing the same in other places by educating people about carbon emissions and cultivating a green culture.

<b> Bringing canola to Oman
</b><br />
<br /> 
A unique research project originated by the research department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has found out several ecological advantages of canola cultivation in different regions of the Sultanate

<br />
<br />
The Directorate General of Agricultural & Livestock Research at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries implemented an innovative research project to adapt and disseminate a new crop, called Canola in different regions of the Sultanate. Aimed at increasing the biodiversity of food crops by introducing new varieties, enhancing the farmers’ income and increasing the agricultural green areas in Oman, the research has proven that Canola crop can serve a dual purpose in the Sultanate: as a green fodder crop to feed the animals, and as material to produce the Canola Oil which is one of the best edible vegetable oils for human consumption as it contains the lowest level of saturated fat. In addition, the beautiful attractive yellow coloured flowers can be a potential source of the nectar for the honey bees.

<br />
<br />
 As part of the research, several varieties of canola crop were tested in four regions, viz. Alkamil Research Station in Sharqia, Wadi Hibi Research Station in Sohar and Jimah Research Station in Al Dakhiliya region and at Salalah Research Station, Dhofar (Southern Oman). Field experiments were conducted consecutively for three years during winter season. Varieties of canola were laid out with four replications. The crop was grown under sprinkler irrigation. The observations on plant height and seed yield per plot were recorded at harvest and seed samples of each plot were sent to the laboratory for determination of oil content. After the successful experiments, three varieties of Canola crop were recommended for cultivation in different locations in Oman. The seeds of these varieties were multiplied and distributed by extension services to the farmers.

<b> Turning waste into fertile soil
</b><br />
<br />
 The remediation of drilling wastes by Free-RAD technology implemented by Ray Eco-Logic can convert contaminated waste into fertile soil, by reducing the waste up to below 1 per cent
<br />
<br />
Ray Eco-Logic has introduced an initiative for remediating drilling wastes by using Free-RAD technology, which can reduce the concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) contaminated waste up to below 1 per cent and to convert the contaminated waste into a fertile soil. The process turns contaminated material into fertile soil good for raising crops, and can be replicated in many places where the drilling waste has been accumulating for years causing damage to the environment. The company has measured the success of the programme by sampling and analysing the TPH content along the process and by comparing it to the time needed to achieve the results.
Implemented for the first time in the GCC, the project has proved more effective compared to other land farming techniques, and raised the interest of other operators in the GCC and other countries to apply this technique on their sites. The project could also convince the user and the authorities that this technique could be applied to reduce the great environmental liability that these wastes represent.&#8194;

<b>OER presents its 14th annual presentation on Oman’s Top 20 leading listed companies for the year 2012						
</b><br />
<br />
The Global economy is yet to recover four years after the beginning of the global financial crisis. During 2012, global economic growth has weakened further. Global growth dropped to almost 3 per cent in 2012. A growing number of developed economies have fallen into a double-dip recession. Those in severe sovereign debt distress moved even deeper into recession, caught in the downward spiraling dynamics from high unemployment, weak aggregate demand compounded by fiscal austerity, high public debt burdens, and financial sector fragility. Growth in the major developing countries and economies in transition has also decelerated notably, reflecting both external vulnerabilities and domestic challenges. Mature economies are still healing from the scars of the 2008-2009 crises. But unlike in 2010 and 2011, emerging markets did not pick up the slack in 2012, and won’t do so in 2013. Most low-income countries have held up relatively well so far, but now face intensified adverse spillover effects from the slowdown in both developed and major middle-income countries. The prospects for the next two years continue to be challenging, fraught with major uncertainties and risks slanted towards the downside. Uncertainty across the regions – from the post-election ‘fiscal debate’ question in the US to the Chinese leadership transition and reforms in the Euro area – will continue to have global impacts in sluggish trade and tepid foreign direct investment.
<br />
<br />
The Omani economy saw another good year in 2012, with high levels of growth on the back of increased oil production and good results from the private sector. GDP at current prices registered a growth rate of 13.1 per cent until the end of September 2012 compared to the same period of 2011, where it increased from RO19,469.1mn until the end of September 2011 to RO22,023.3mn in the same period of 2012. 
<br />
<br />
The government was expecting to close 2012 with an average oil price of around $109 per barrel compared with an average price of $102.95 in 2011 and the budgeted price of $80 for 2012. 
<br />
<br />
For the year 2012, the MSM Index increased by 1.15 per cent. This is compared to a decrease of 15.69 per cent in the previous year. The industrial sector was the largest gainer at 24.4 per cent for the year 2012. The services sector was next which increased by 14.57 per cent for the year. The financial sector closed the year with a gain of 3.73 per cent. A total of 4.3bn shares got traded during the year amounting to an aggregate turnover of RO1.066bn, which was up by about 7.5 per cent compared to last year. The MSM 30 Index hit a low of 5,357 points during the year while the high for the year was 6,045 points closing the year at 5,760.84 points. With a return of 1.15 per cent for the year, the MSM was the fifth best performing market in the GCC region behind UAE (DFM), which advanced 19.89 per cent, followed by UAE (AD) at 9.52 per cent for the year. Saudi Arabia was third with an advance of 5.98 per cent followed by Kuwait at 2.07 per cent. Qatar at 4.79 per cent and Bahrain at 6.83 per cent were down for the year. 
<br />
<br />
On balance, global stock market performance was surprisingly good. Despite being in the EuroZone, Germany (Frankfurt) led the way in 2012 with an impressive 29 per cent gain. India (Mumbai) rebounded strongly, up 26 per cent, followed closely by Hong Kong with a gain of 23 per cent. In 2012, the global market capitalisation recovered with a 15.1 per cent growth rate to $54.57 trn. WTI oil price during the year ranged from $100 per barrel reducing to around $80 and closing the year at about $95. Gold remained in the $ 1,600 –1,700 per ounce range. 
<br />
<br />
The substantial increase in oil prices during the year was supported by increased oil production and increased non-oil exports which resulted in a real GDP growth rate for 2012 of 8 per cent. Oil production in 2012 increased again by about 3 per cent to 915,000 barrels per day. The government’s continued emphasis on diversifying the economy away from dependence on oil continued to gain further momentum during 2012. Non-oil exports grew by about 19 per cent.
<br />
<br />

During the year 2012, the revenues of Oman’s 20 largest companies showed an increase of RO246mn. Total revenues for the OER Top 20 companies increased by 6.69 per cent to RO3,932mn. Corporate performance for the year 2012, overall, also increased. The profits for the year 2012 increased by 15 per cent to RO530mn from RO460mn last year. The total market cap of the OER Top 20 companies on December 31, 2012 was RO5,394 mn, which increased by 15 per cent compared to 2011. On March 31, 2013, the market cap of the Top 20 increased by a further 28 per cent to RO5,534mn. The OER Top 20 companies represent 69 per cent to the total market cap of the MSM of RO7,804mn at the end of 2012. The average P/E ratio of the OER Top 20 based on the profits of the year 2011 and the share price on March 31, 2012 is 12.3 times earnings.

<br />
<b>Who is out and who is in
</b><br />
<br />
We have one new comer on the list this year. HSBC Bank Oman, a newcomer in the market by virtue of a merger with OIB in 2012 comes in at number 19. 
<br />
<br />
HSBC Oman has made it to the OER Top Twenty this year at the expense of Al Hassan Engineering. 
<br />
<br />
The ranking of Oman’s twenty largest companies in order of revenue produces a list, which includes the eight companies from the services sector, six companies from the financial sector, and six from the industrial sector. 

<br />
<br />
Omantel continues to be the largest public company in Oman with a growth in revenue of 1.39 per cent compared to last year. Bank Muscat, Shell and Galfar retain their respective positions from last year of number two, three and four respectively. Al Maha jumps up to the number five position from being number eight last year. Renaissance which was number five last year has slipped to number seven. 
<br />
<br /><center><img src="images/cs_1.jpg"></center>
						<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">

The chairman of Omantel <b>Eng. Sultan Bin Hamdoon Al Harthi </b>in his report to the shareholders explains that the total revenue increased by 1.4 per cent. The increase is contributed by service, wholesale and mobile business segments. He further explains that the total operating expenses increased by 1.3 per cent. Al Harthi states that the group has achieved a net profit after tax of RO116.2mn compared to the net profit of RO111.6mn in 2011, an increase of 4.1 per cent. Al Harthi adds that the total subscriber base has recorded a growth of 8.5 per cent. The total number of subscribers has increased to 3.8 million compared to 3.5 million in 2011.
<br />
<br />
Al Harthi states the telecom sector in Oman is likely to experience further intense competition in Year 2013. The company has already withstood the competition successfully and with integrated operating structure, it is well positioned to face evolving competition. Al Harthi is hopeful that Omantel would continue this performance in spite of increasing competitive pressure.<br />
<br />
Four of the top five most profitable companies in Oman are the same as last year with one newcomer in the list being BankDhofar at the expense of Ominvest. Bank Muscat retains the number one position as the most profitable company in 2012. Omantel continues at the number two position. NBO has moved up one place to the number three slot. BankDhofar comes in at the number four position. Oman Qatari Telecom slips two places to the number five position from being number three last year.
<br />
<br />
BankMuscat is the most profitable company in Oman as well as the second largest company in Oman based on turnover for the year 2012. Bank Muscat continues to retain this position from last year, and has recorded a growth in profit for the year of about 18.4 per cent.<br />
<br /><center><img src="images/cs_2.jpg"></center>
						<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
Its chairman <b>Khalid bin Mustahail Al Mashani</b> states in his year-end report to the shareholders that the results achieved have been encouraging despite the challenging global economic and financial situation. The key business lines of the bank recorded healthy performance on expected lines. He explains that the bank achieved a net profit of RO139.2mn as against a net profit of RO117.5mn in 2011, an increase of 18.4 percent over the year 2011.
<br />
<br />
Mashani adds that during 2012, the return on average assets marginally improved to 1.84 per cent compared to 1.79 per cent in 2011. The return on average equity was 15.42 per cent in 2012 compared to 15.37 per cent in 2011 and the basic earnings per share was RO0.072 as against RO0.065 in 2011.
<br />
<br />
Mashani goes on to say that the board has proposed a dividend of 40 per cent, 25 per cent in the form of cash and 15 per cent in the form of mandatory convertible bonds. Mashani advises that the overall economic outlook for 2013 remains positive with the government announcing a 29 per cent increase in spending. Indications are that infrastructure projects will continue to give a fillip to the economy in 2013.
<br />
<br />
BankDhofar has shown the highest growth in profits by an enormous 170.07 per cent and comes in straight at the number one spot. Four of the five top companies showing the highest growth of profit from last year-BankDhofar, Oman Cables, Galfar and Raysut Cement-are new on the list. SMN Power has slipped three places to the fourth position. Oman Refreshment, Al Jazeera, Bank Sohar and Al Maha Petroleum, which were on this list last year, have all dropped off.
<br />
<br /><center><img src="images/cs_4.jpg"></center>
						<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
The chairman of BankDhofar, <b>Eng. Abdul Hafidh Salim Rajab Al Aujaili </b>in his annual report to the shareholders states that the bank continued to grow in 2012 in all key areas with total asset sustaining a growth of 9.18 per cent, improving from RO1.96bn at the end of December 2011 to reach RO2.14bn at the end of December 2012. The net loans and advances extended to customers achieved a growth of 12.08 per cent from RO1.49bn at the end of 2011 to reach RO1.67bn at the end of December 2012. Further, the customer deposits mobilized by the bank achieved a growth of 7.24 per cent from RO1.52bn at the end of 2011 to reach RO1.63bn at the end of 2012.
<br />
<br />
Al Aujaili explains that the net profit for the year 2012 achieved by the bank is RO37.75mn as against RO13.98mn, due to the effect of the legal case loss of RO26.1mn, in 2011. The board of directors recommends a cash dividend of 15 per cent amounting to RO16.5mn and a bonus share issue of 10 per cent, aggregating to 110.01mn shares of RO0.100 each, of the share capital of the bank.<br />

                    </b><br>
                    A winner of 13 Grammy awards, Michael Jackson (MJ) etched 
                    a place for himself in the hearts and minds of people and 
                    set the world dancing. His musical genius was often overshadowed 
                    by a bizarre<img src="images/t1.jpg" width="150" height="222" hspace="9" vspace="5" align="right"> 
                    and extremely controversial lifestyle. But history will remember 
                    MJ as a man who managed to break through every racial and 
                    artistic barrier to become a global pop icon and a true musical 
                    genius.<br>
                    <br>
                    Born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, US he was the seventh 
                    of nine children. He rose to fame as the lead singer of the 
                    Jackson 5, a band he formed with his brothers in the late 
                    1960s. The group’s first four singles – “I Want You Back,” 
                    “ABC,” “The Love You Save” and “I’ll Be There” – went to No. 
                    1 on the Billboard pop chart, the first time any group had 
                    pulled off that feat. In 1972, he hit No. 1 as a solo artist 
                    with the song “Ben.” By the late ’70s he was topping the charts 
                    with cuts from “Off the Wall,” including “Rock With You” and 
                    “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough.”<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The ubiquitous<br>
                    </b>In 1982, he released “Thriller,” an album that eventually 
                    produced seven hit singles. For the rest of the 1980s, they 
                    came no bigger. “Thriller’s” follow-up, “Bad,” sold millions 
                    of copies worldwide.<br>
                    <br>
                    It was in 1983 that Jackson introduced a dance move that will 
                    most probably be the defining visual burnished in fans’ memories 
                    – The Moonwalk. That singular dance move could well be the 
                    greatest move of all time. People copied his Jheri-curled 
                    hair and single-gloved, zippered-jacket look. He posed for 
                    photos with President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan at the 
                    White House. Paul McCartney teamed with him on three duets, 
                    two of which became top five hits. He was given the nickname 
                    the “King of Pop” – a spin on Elvis Presley’s status as “the 
                    King of Rock ‘n’ Roll” – and few questioned the moniker.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1991, he again came out with the smash hit album, “Dangerous” 
                    which had the number, “Black or White”. Jackson released a 
                    two-CD greatest hits collection entitled “HIStory” in 1995 
                    which sold relatively poorly. A 2001 album of new material, 
                    “Invincible” did even worse. After that things started going 
                    downhill for Jackson. His life was marked with controversies 
                    and he was constantly under intense media scrutiny. However, 
                    in the end, the only redeeming quality of the man was his 
                    work. Jackson has sold 750 million records worldwide and holds 
                    eight Guinness records, including most successful entertainer 
                    of all time. He revolutionised pop music with an array of 
                    global influences in music and dance. His video “Thriller” 
                    single-handedly broke the colour barrier on MTV at a time 
                    when no African-American artists were featured on the burgeoning 
                    music video channel.<br>
                    <br>
                    Almost every pop/hiphop musician today lists MJ as a major 
                    influence from their youth. And so do most choreographers. 
                    Capable of unleashing mass hysteria like the Beatles and Elvis, 
                    when he died in Los Angeles, he had been labelled a fallen 
                    star – but a star who could still whip up a sold-out concert.</font>

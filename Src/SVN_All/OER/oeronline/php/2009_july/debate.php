						<font face="Verdana" size="1">The answer seems to lie in 
                        selecting the lesser of the two evils. The social and 
                        political costs of liquidation would be very high and 
                        disruptive with a huge domino effect. On the other hand, 
                        revival would cost as much and may even fail if GM does 
                        not shed many of its fixed obligations and does not 
                        recover from the sins of the past through an accelerated 
                        implementation of the turnaround programme. Chapter 11 
                        bankruptcy appears to be the most promising way forward 
                        for GM to reduce its debts (which is twice its total 
                        assets) and compel settlements which would reduce its 
                        operating costs. Sale of Hummer, Saturn and SAB brands, 
                        continuing with fewer dealerships, development of 
                        smaller fuel efficient vehicles to substitute its 
                        previous focus on SUV’s, etc., would prevent the cash 
                        drain and may restore long-term viability of GM.</font></td>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">GM is a typical example of a 
corporation that has grown so big that it has lost control over itself. Over the 
years they had developed such rigidity in their operating styles that very 
little initiative or innovation could thrive in that ambience. I have personally 
dealt with them for supply of batteries through their China after market centre 
and was amazed to see a complete lack of initiative or enthusiasm. Their tender 
documents would run into 100s of pages even to buy a few dollars worth of parts. 
There was a complete disconnect in their buying systems between quality 
prequalification and online bidding processes. The reason is their 
‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to buying. This is the reason, I have stated that 
in their present form they could neither be revived nor restructured. The only 
solution is to split them into more manageable sizes. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The fundamental reason for the 
downfall of GM is underscored by the Bernstein Research which attributed the 
collapse of GM to adopting a strategy of cutting prices to improve sales and 
keep the show going instead of dealing with the real issues of rationalising 
products, manufacturing capacities and distribution network. Secondly, GM had 
over the years accumulated huge chunks of unproductive costs such as 
compensation paid to unionised workers who were laid off due to automation, 
which did not give them any value and made the company non-competitive as 
compared with other non-American manufacturers. </font></p>

                        year they had been talking of a ‘Hummer centered’ sales 
                        push strategy , which shows how much out of touch with 
                        market reality they had been. The American consumer had 
                        been going for more fuel efficient compact cars while GM 
                        had been continuing to promote big cars which were 
                        nowhere as efficient as the Japanese vehicles. Further 
                        their inability to cut costs has been another reason for 
                        their downfall.<br>

						<font face="Verdana" size="1">Firstly, serious financial 
                        problems need to be addressed expeditiously and 
                        strategically. The financial losses in ’05, ’06, ’07 &amp; 
                        ’08 warranted a serious relook at the company’s cost 
                        structures and product mix rather than taking the easy 
                        way out of lowering prices. Secondly, creating and 
                        retaining competitive advantage is a necessity. GM’s 
                        business model was out of sync when compared with the 
                        likes of Toyota and Honda, which had a significant 
                        impact on business results. Thirdly, GM could not afford 
                        to be caught in a web of relationships designed for 
                        another era. </font></td>

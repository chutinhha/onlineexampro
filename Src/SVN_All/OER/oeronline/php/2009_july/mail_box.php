                <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The well focused cover story of 
                the June issue of OER coinciding with the World Environment Day 
                – captured the concept very well. The stories written by experts 
                in this regard were truly enlightening and stressed on the 
                primary importance of keeping our surroundings safe for the 
                continuous existence of life.<br>
                <br>
                </b>The responsibility to safeguard nature and environment rests 
                with every individual, and contribution should come from all 
                walks of life with a clear objective in mind. It is also equally 
                important to look into introducing an effective waste management 
                practice with the active support from the corporate level, yet 
                it is another critical area to be focused today. It is a fact 
                that waste in any form is a threat to living things.It’s a good 
                sign that Oman has been part of this initiative at various 
                levels with active involvement of government as well as private 
                sector establishments. Media is one of the effective channels to 
                reach out the message across the society, and OER’s initiative 
                in this regard is very well appreciated.<br>
                <br>
                Obviously, Oman Green Awards can be considered as a 
                society-focused initiative from OER, and this campaign is 
                another set of initiatives by a corporate organisation which I 
                hope will reap good results. Meanwhile, I take this opportunity 
                to wish the organisers’ of OER Oman Green Awards all the very 
                best! </font>

                </b></font>The OER June issue was great. Through the cover story 
                we came to know about the social responsibility being taken up 
                by the companies as a step to keep our “Mother Earth green”. But 
                I would like to share my views about the topic “Incredible India 
                – The Traveller’s Paradise” (Pg 68) in which the writer mentions 
                that he has travelled to Mumbai, Delhi and Agra for the 
                exclusive report. No doubt he has covered many aspects but I 
                think a detailed report on tourist sites would have invoked much 
                more curiosity in the readers to go to India. We think that a 
                series can be started covering all the tourists sites one by one 
                in detail. By that we can help our nation in achieving its 
                growth target and the tourists as a guide and can be 
                “Ambassadors of great Indian culture heritage”.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

                point written by Sridhar Sridharan is my favourite column in the

                countries and geographical information. Kudos to OER, keep the

                First of all, great job on your latest issue of OER. Aside from 
                the literature, there was a clear focus on the practical 
                initiatives that many can contribute with ease. This will help 
                in translating words into action to the much spoken about topic 
                concerning our environment and goes hand in hand with the 
                country’s vision in promoting an eco friendly atmosphere. Wish 
                you and your team all the best and further success in your 
                efforts.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

                </b></font>People the world over are sitting up and paying 
                attention to the ever increasing need to go ‘green’. And people 
                in Oman are no different. The ‘Green’ issue of Oman Economic 
                Review was informative and well-thought out.<br>
                <br>
                More often than not, large corporations get blamed for all the 
                environmental problems prevalent today. And hence, it was truly 
                heartening to read about the measures that companies in Oman are 
                taking in order to become more environment-friendly. It’s true 
                that we still have a long way to go, but the strides that Oman 
                has taken so far, speaks volumes of what the future holds. <br>
                <br>
                Congratulations to the OER team for a job well done!</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

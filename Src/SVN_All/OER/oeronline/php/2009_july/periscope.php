                    </b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Contrary to political 
                    rhetoric in places like Beijing and Moscow, there is actually 
                    strong foreign central bank demand for US debt, as witnessed 
                    by the high indirect bidders in the recent US Treasury note 
                    auctions<br>
                    </b><br>
                    The dollar has <img src="images/p1.jpg" width="103" height="122" hspace="9" vspace="5" align="right">been 
                    under a state of siege in the global currency market, falling 
                    from 89 on the Dollar Index in March to as low as 78 by early 
                    June. Yet the free fall in the dollar now threatens the strategic 
                    economic policy interests of the Obama White House, the Federal 
                    Reserve, the US Treasury, the ECB and even the Central Banks 
                    of countries as diverse as Switzerland, Canada, Singapore 
                    and New Zealand. The Japanese Finance Minister stressed his 
                    “unshakable faith” in the dollar and his Russian peer explicitly 
                    repudiated the Kremlin’s anti-greenback threats at the G-8 
                    summit in Italy. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The sell off is over<br>
                    </b>In essence, the worlds captains and kings all have a strategic 
                    interest in avoiding a dollar free fall because the world’s 
                    bond markets realise the danger of inflation risk due to the 
                    money printing spree of the G-8 central banks. It is no coincidence 
                    that the money markets now price a Fed rate hike by the November 
                    FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee), with the yield on the 
                    two-year US Treasury note at 1.35 basis point. The ten year 
                    Treasury bond yield has traded as high as four per cent, double 
                    its safe haven low of two per cent, only three months ago. 
                    A dollar sell off will mean carnage for the bond market, which 
                    could well choke the mortgage refinancing wave in the US at 
                    a time when the house prices are still falling and 21mn homeowner 
                    mortgages are underwater. <br>
                    <br>
                    A spike in US Treasury bond yields to four or even 4.5 per 
                    cent will also add untold billions to the financing costs 
                    of the Obama budget deficit. It will be impossible for the 
                    Treasury to auction $2trn in Uncle Sam debt to foreign central 
                    banks if there is even the merest hint of a dollar collapse. 
                    The Federal Reserve cannot risk a spike in inflation costs 
                    from expensive imports at a time when congressional politics 
                    and a 9.4 per cent unemployment rate make a November rate 
                    hike impossible. Canada lumber, New Zealand milk and Australian 
                    mining company profits are being gutted by the strength in 
                    the three commodity markets.<br>
                    <br>
                    The German Bundesbank has no desire to see a higher Euro at 
                    a time when industrial production has plunged by 20 per cent, 
                    the risk of a Latvian devaluation and Baltic’s contagion is 
                    all too real and the fragmented German Landesbanken are some 
                    of the most leveraged banks in the world. Even Peer Steinbruck, 
                    the German minister, criticised the recent Euro rise, a natural 
                    reaction since he refuses to disclose the individual details 
                    of European bank stress tests. The Asian exporters have even 
                    hinted that they could intervene to decelerate the rise in 
                    their currencies at a time when high crude oil prices have 
                    eroded the regional surplus. The geopolitics of finance has 
                    flashed an unmistakable message: the dollar <br>
                    sell off is over!<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Trend reversal</b><b><br>
                    </b>It is significant that strong US economic data now triggers 
                    dollar buying, not dollar selling, as we saw after May payroll’s 
                    fell only 345,000, far below the consensus minus 505,000. 
                    This is because the lower US current account deficit means 
                    the dollar’s value is determined by foreign central bank buying 
                    of US dollar assets. C<img src="images/pe3.jpg" width="200" height="185" align="left">ontrary 
                    to political rhetoric in places like Beijing and Moscow, there 
                    is actually strong foreign central bank demand for US debt, 
                    as witnessed by the high indirect bidders in the recent US 
                    Treasury note auctions.<br>
                    <br>
                    US dollar money market rates have overshot their peers in 
                    German Bunds and Japanese government debt, a reliable advance 
                    indicator of dollar strength. The credibility of US monetary 
                    policy only increases with all the talk in the capital markets 
                    about exit strategies, the Fed balance sheet, quantitative 
                    easing and steepness of the dollar yield curve. A counter 
                    cyclical dollar rally is coming this summer. The Euro can 
                    fall as low as 1.35, the Yen is headed to 104-106, Sterling 
                    can well fall to 1.54 against the greenback.<br>
                    <br>
                    A dollar rally has profound implication for crude oil prices 
                    and could well trigger a correction in GCC equities. A $70 
                    oil price is simply not sustainable with a fragile global 
                    economy, the highest inventories in the West since the early 
                    1990’s and a potential Saudi Arabian output rise as the US 
                    Senate protests against the surge in black gold. There are 
                    more than 130mn barrels of crude oil and diesel stored in 
                    offshore tankers, and these supplies will hit the spot markets.<br>
                    <br>
                    OPEC compliance is slipping, with Ecuador, Angola, Iran and 
                    Nigeria in defacto non-compliance. The surge in the crude 
                    oil from $32 to $70 in four months was due to the plunge in 
                    the dollar in the currency markets, not any real exchange 
                    in the supply-demand equation. If the dollar rises to 106 
                    Yen or 1.35 Euro, crude oil prices can well fall $20 to as 
                    low as $50. This is definitely a tangible risk to the current 
                    bull run in
                    Gulf equities.</font>

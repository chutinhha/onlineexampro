                    “land grab” began last year as the food price crisis continued 
                    to spiral out of control. Rich nations heading to poor, but 
                    fertile, countries to secure food for their populations was 
                    a concept that has never been seen on this scale <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    </b>At the OER Top 20 Debate and Awards event held on May 
                    31, 2009, HE Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, Minister of Commerce 
                    and Industry, cited the two greatest “new challenges” currently 
                    racking the <img src="images/economy1.jpg" width="109" height="126" hspace="9" vspace="4" align="right">minds 
                    of government officials: inflation and food security. The 
                    two are in fact intertwined. Between the start of 2007 and 
                    mid-2008 the food price index rose by 78 per cent, according 
                    to research by the Economist. In an effort to avoid a shortage 
                    Oman stockpiled flour and grain, causing, in part, inflation 
                    to swell to a peak of 14 per cent in mid-2008. This figure 
                    has now eased to 4.9 per cent as of April and food prices 
                    have fallen off their peak. But food insecurity will continue 
                    to plague Oman, along with many other countries, thanks to 
                    expanding global population and declining farmland productivity.<br>
                    <br>
                    The impetus to secure reliable food supplies has led Saudi 
                    Arabia, Qatar and the UAE among others to look outside of 
                    their arid borders towards Asian and, more frequently, African 
                    farmland as a means to feed their populations. In these offshore 
                    farming deals long-term leases (usually 50-99 years) on arable 
                    land are exchanged for investments or the promise of investment 
                    in the host country’s infrastructure.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>UNCTAD study<br>
                    </b>While Oman has yet to indicate it will follow this course, 
                    HE Maqbool recently announced he was enlisting the help of 
                    UNCTAD to conduct a study on feasible solutions to the country’s 
                    food problem. Iraq has also been soliciting agricultural investment 
                    within the Gulf, with a recent invitation to develop its agricultural 
                    lands on a long-term lease. It will be months before the results 
                    of the UNCTAD study are released but many expect offshore 
                    farming – in the style of neighbours like Saudi Arabia and 
                    Qatar – to be a likely prescription. Should these observers 
                    be proven right, the Sultanate would have the benefit of learning 
                    from its predecessors’ experience.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to research released in April by the International 
                    Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), GCC governments or 
                    their investment authorities have signed, requested or implemented 
                    deals that amount to over 950,000 hectares (ha) on the African 
                    continent, excluding deals for which no details were released. 
                    In Asia the same figure is about 430,000 ha. Host countries 
                    are rewarded with loans or financial support for infrastructure 
                    development, along with a nominal land fee. The Gulf obviously 
                    has the funds to back up such promises: the Qatar Investment 
                    Authority (QIA) has a $60bn investment vehicle dedicated to 
                    food and energy investments around the globe, along with a 
                    $1bn fund specifically for agriculture investments in Vietnam. 
                    Saudi Arabia has a dedicated state investment group worth 
                    $800mn to target agricultural projects abroad. The potential 
                    is certainly there for a symbiotic exchange between countries 
                    rich in capital and those blessed with fertile soil. In the 
                    case of the deals between the Gulf and Africa, the latter 
                    needs infrastructure development while the former cannot meet 
                    domestic food demand without a massive import bill.<br>
                    <br>
                    At a June World Economic Forum meeting in Cape Town, the World 
                    Bank Vice President of the Africa region, Obiageli Katryn 
                    Ezekwesili, said the continent would require $80bn in annual 
                    investment to be competitive in the global economy. Agriculture 
                    is one of the few sectors that have remained attractive during 
                    the credit downturn and now that investment appetite and oil 
                    prices have both started to pick up again, the Gulf’s farmland 
                    investments could give Africa a hearty push towards Ezekwesili’s 
                    ambitious prescription. <br>
                    <br>
                    An UN official has been quoted in the international press 
                    as saying offshore farming deals could be “part of the solution” 
                    to Africa’s troubles. However a successful give-and-take relationship 
                    will occur only if both host and investor country are aware 
                    of the sensitivity required in brokering land deals in chronically 
                    impoverished countries where hunger remains a stubborn issue. 
                    The first-ever extensive report on this new wave of farm deals 
                    – characterised by massive scale and government, rather than 
                    private, involvement – is aptly subtitled “Risks and Opportunities.” 
                    It studies five sub-Saharan African countries and was released 
                    in May by the IFPRI in cooperation with the FAO. It draws 
                    attention to problematic leases, in which land of dubious 
                    ownership (small farmers, who make up 70 per cent of Africa’s 
                    population, often do not have access to formal land deeds) 
                    is swapped for abstract, often vague promises of investment. 
                    Endemic corruption in many African and Asian host countries 
                    and a lack of contractual transparency leaves much room for 
                    doubt amongst local shareholders that they will see tangible 
                    benefits.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Potential backlash<br>
                    </b>The report also notes what some may consider the blatantly 
                    obvious: using the farmland of countries with either perennial 
                    food shortages or famine to export food engenders political 
                    opposition, both within domestic and international circles. 
                    Indeed, residents of the land in question have been known 
                    to stage fierce protests when their land is put up for sale, 
                    leaving some investor countries wondering if there isn’t a 
                    better way. In Madagascar, for example, South Korea’s failed 
                    attempt to lease an area the size of Qatar on the island nation 
                    led to the overthrow of a government. More recently, Kenyan 
                    conservationists have threatened to “fight to the death” against 
                    a deal that cedes 40,000 hectares in the Tana River Delta 
                    – along with its rich array of biodiversity – to Qatar in 
                    exchange for a $2.5bn loan to build a deep-water port. <br>
                    <br>
                    However the various promised investments, if implemented properly, 
                    would likely benefit the very shareholders protesting. Better 
                    roads, for example, would allow farmers to get their produce 
                    to market more quickly. The solution to extracting the greatest 
                    benefit out of these deals while minimising risk could lie 
                    in international monitoring, says the report.<br>
                    <br>
                    Momentum is gathering amongst developed countries calling 
                    for stricter regulation and greater oversight to ensure contractual 
                    promises are met. Japan is leading the calls from G8 countries 
                    to bring in tighter regulations and an international body 
                    to oversee the implementation of every aspect of lease contracts. 
                    The African Union too is pushing for an international overseer.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moreover the rise in overseas farming comes at a time that 
                    could be most broadly defined as a “stress test” for the global 
                    capitalist system. The financial crisis fallout has no doubt 
                    weakened the trust many held in the merits of the international 
                    free market system. Slow signs of recovery have allayed some 
                    of these fears and the world’s clock will no doubt keep ticking 
                    to the tune of globalised capitalism. But it is in this make-or-break 
                    moment for a new, more stable capitalist system that the Gulf 
                    – and perhaps Oman in the future – are forging a rather novel 
                    form of global venture, that is, government-funded offshore 
                    farming.<br>
                    <br>
                    While they have certainly garnered their fair share of controversy 
                    in the media, farming deals have the potential, with the proper 
                    oversight and implementation, to illustrate the constructive 
                    value of capitalism as well as its ability to adapt to a world 
                    of increasingly limited resources and narrow the gap between 
                    the rich and poor.<br>
                    <br>
                    Should Oman, a net-importer of food, choose to follow the 
                    path of its GCC neighbours and tend fields outside its borders, 
                    it would be well-placed to model a form of truly mutually-beneficial 
                    offshore farming arrangements. Besides increased food security, 
                    the Sultanate would also gain good marks for its international 
                    reputation for a clean farm deal in developing countries – 
                    a factor that should not be underestimated.</font>

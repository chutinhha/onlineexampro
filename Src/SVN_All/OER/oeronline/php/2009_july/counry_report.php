                The Eurasian state is making all efforts to minimiSe the impact 
                of global economic slowdown on its economy. AKSHAY BHATNAGAR 
                REPORTS FROM TURKEY<br>
                <br>
                The moment one gets down at the Istanbul Ataturk International 
                Airport one can feel the vibrancy in the environment. Scores of 
                people are rushing in to catch their flight and many more are 
                exiting from the airport to move on to their desired 
                destinations in Turkey. With the airport brimming with so much 
                of action, it indicates that the claims of the Turkish 
                government that the country on the crossroads between the 
                continents of Europe, Asia and Africa is successfully managing 
                the challenge of global recession are legitimate. Don’t believe 
                it yet? According to The Economist magazine, foreign investors 
                remain highly optimistic about Turkey’s stance during the global 
                financial turmoil. Many economic developments taken place during 
                the last few weeks confirms The Economist’s view point.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The Pull Factor<br>
                </b>Zaman-Ford Otosan, a joint venture between US automotive 
                giant Ford and Turkey’s largest industrial conglomerate, Koc 
                Holding, has just started exports to the US. Ford has never 
                before exported cars to its home country from a Ford factory in 
                Europe, and Turkey will be the first European country to export 
                Ford cars to the “homeland”. The Turkish automobile manufacturer 
                Tofas, a joint venture between Italy’s Fiat and Koc Holding, 
                will invest around EUR 300mn this year in its new research and 
                development (R&amp;D) activities, as well as new products. Turkey is 
                continuously boosting its power in the automotive sector. The 
                country, exporting automobiles to more than 100 countries all 
                over the world, also supplies crucial spare parts for many 
                countries. Sarigozlu Hidrolik Makine ve Kalip Sanayi, a company 
                operating in the Aegean province of Manisa, is manufacturing 
                castings for ten big brands, including Porsche and Jaguar.<br>
                <br>
                The US private equity Global Environment Fund (GEF) is eyeing 
                Turkey’s growing alternative energy sector. GEF, managing a 
                total of $1bn worth of funds globally, aims to widen its 
                investments in renewable and alternative means of energy. 
                Another notable addition to energy investments in Turkey comes 
                from Edison SpA (EDN.MI), a leading Italian energy company. The 
                company plans to invest EUR 1bn for expansion in the 
                southeastern Mediterranean area. In yet another development, an 
                energy partnership between the German company EnBW and Turkish 
                conglomerate Borusan Holding has been signed to invest EUR 2.5bn 
                over the next 8-10 years. The joint venture will focus primarily 
                on renewable energy and make an investment to produce 1,000 
                megawatts (MW) of power after completing 17 projects, with a 
                final target of 2,000 MW.<br>
                <br>
                The Turkish pharmaceutical market, with an annual volume of 
                $10bn, has drawn the attention of Japanese investors, in 
                addition to European and US companies. Japan’s two largest 
                pharmaceutical companies have already started to operate in 
                Turkey. Ken Jones, EMRA CEO of Astellas (one of the two Japanese 
                pharma giants), said, “Turkey has the sixth largest 
                pharmaceutical market of Europe, and it will rank in the top ten 
                list of the world soon”. One of world’s largest electronics 
                retailers, Best Buy, is opening stores in Turkey. Robert A. 
                Willet, CEO of Best Buy, said they plan to open three stores in 
                Izmir, Ankara and Bursa by the first quarter of 2010. Willet 
                stated that there is a fast growing market in Turkey, which he 
                sees as the “China of Europe”.<br>
                <br>
                In another boost to the local industry, Raytheon (a major 
                American defense contractor and industrial corporation with core 
                manufacturing concentrations in defense systems and defense and 
                commercial electronics) has appointed Roketsan, a Turkish 
                missile manufacturer, as an international supplier of a key 
                component of the Patriot Guidance Enhanced Missile-Tactical, or 
                Patriot GEM-T. Roketsan is a proven leader in missile and rocket 
                programmes and has been a major part of Turkey’s defense 
                industry since 1988.<br>
                <br>
                Boeing, that provides direct employment for more than one 
                thousand people in Turkey, expects to reach a business volume of 
                more than $1.2bn by 2013 in the country. Joe McAndrew, Vice 
                President-Europe, Boeing Business Development, recently stated 
                that a big portion of their investments will be located in 
                Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir and added that the KC-135R tanker 
                aircraft project in Turkey stands out as a ‘model’ for local 
                studies.<br>
                <br>
                China is also not left behind in making inroads into Turkey. 
                Jinan province of China is making a $200mn investment for health 
                tourism in Turkey. Steve Ballmer, CEO of the world’s largest 
                software company Microsoft, recently laid the foundation of an 
                ‘Innovation Center’ in Ankara. He stated that Turkey stands to 
                be one of the top ten countries for Microsoft in terms of 
                business volume. Ballmer said Turkey, with its dynamic economy 
                and its young, technically-inclined population, has a vast 
                potential for development and added that the country may become 
                the software center of Europe.<br>
                <br>
                Overall, Turkey has attracted significant amount of FDI so far. 
                Even in 2008, gross FDI inflow to Turkey was around $17.7bn, an 
                impressive figure despite the challenging environment. This 
                year, the country is expecting an FDI inflow of over $10bn. The 
                country is fairly stable on the foreign exchange reserves front 
                as well. Towards the end of April this year, the Central Bank of 
                the Republic of Turkey’s reserve was pegged at $62.4bn. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Countering Economic Slowdown<br>
                </b>As Turkey is intrinsically integrated into the global 
                economy, the financial meltdown has casted an impact on the 
                country but it is not as severe as seen in many of the western 
                economies. The Turkish government has been prudent in taking 
                adequate measures to withstand the crisis. “As part of our 
                monetary measures, the rates have been cut five consecutive 
                times since November. In totality, the central bank has cut the 
                borrowing rate by 625 basis points to 10.5%; and its lending 
                rate by 675 basis points to 13%. We expect the inflation to come 
                down to 7.5% towards the end of the year,” said HE Engin Turker, 
                Turkey’s ambassador to Oman.<br>
                <br>
                Among the prominent measures taken to boost investor confidence 
                and financing, the government has permitted payment of overdue 
                taxes in installments. Last November, a new law was approved 
                that facilitates bringing certain assets such as gold, cash and 
                securities, in Turkey and/or registering of such assets. The 
                profits earned outside the country are exempted from income and 
                corporate taxes if they are brought to Turkey in certain 
                conditions. The Council of Ministers has also been empowered to 
                increase and expand the coverage of government guarantee on 
                deposits for two years. The 10 per cent withholding tax levied 
                on sale and purchase of the shares by domestic investors was 
                withdrawn.<br>
                <br>
                To support exports, production and employment, the central bank 
                has increased the export rediscount credit limit from $500mn to 
                $1bn. To prop up small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the Small 
                and Medium Sized Industry Development Organization (KOSGEB) is 
                giving interest free loans up to Turkish Lira 700mn 
                (approximately RO175mn) to SMEs. Another loan of upto $650mn 
                with interest free rate has been allocated to export oriented 
                SMEs. In 2009, KOSGEB is expected to provide $1bn in loans to 
                SME exporters. This year, Turkey’s Eximbank plans to provide 
                $12.9bn in financial support to exporters. To increase the 
                resilience of the financial markets, apart from other measures, 
                the foreign exchange reserve requirement has been reduced from 
                11% to 9%. With this move alone, $2.5bn have been injected into 
                the banking system. The central bank has also given the 
                assurance that if required the foreign exchange reserve 
                requirement ratio may be reduced further.<br>
                <br>
                “Additional measures have been taken to support the reverse 
                dollarization process and promote deposits and loans in Turkish 
                Lira,” added HE Turker. To improve the efficient functioning of 
                the interbank foreign exchange market, the central bank has 
                extended the maturity of its US dollar and Euro lending to banks 
                in the foreign exchange deposit markets from one month to three 
                months. The lending rates for transactions have been reduced 
                from 7% to 5.5% for US dollar and from 9% to 6.5% for Euro. The 
                foreign exchange sale auctions in March have also added to 
                foreign exchange liquidity in the market.<br>
                <br>
                All these steps are expected to give a fillip to the economy in 
                Turkey. The global financial management and advisory company 
                Merrill Lynch has estimated a 3.2 percent economic growth rate 
                in Turkey for 2010, despite the general slowdown in the world 
                economy. Turkey will make a quicker recovery than other 
                countries of the region thanks to relatively minimal damage in 
                the banking sector, households and firms, according to a Merrill 
                Lynch analysis.<br>

                      economic co-operation between Turkey and Oman has been 
                      growing at a faster rate. The bilateral trade between Oman 
                      and Turkey increased to $227mn in 2008, a rise of 137 per 
                      cent over 2007 figure. Items such as building materials 
                      like iron &amp; steel, and industrial products, consumer goods 
                      and food products form bulk of the trade that covers 
                      almost 300 different product categories. The trade is 
                      loaded in favour of Turkey as the country contributes more 
                      than 90 per cent of the 300 goods exchanged between the 
                      two. “In Oman, over a dozen Turkish companies are active 
                      in various industries including tourism, construction, 
                      real estate, trading etc. The total value of the contracts 
                      is over $3.5bn. Recently, a joint venture of Turkey's TAV 
                      Construction and Athens-based Consolidated Contractors Co 
                      (CCC) got the contract worth RO450mn for the first phase 
                      of the new Muscat International Airport project. In 
                      another development, Turkish firm BOTEK (Bosphorous 
                      Technical Consulting Corporation) has got the contract for 
                      design consultancy services of the 85-km stretch of 
                      Batinah Expressway project. The contract is valued at 
                      RO2.558mn,” said HE Engin Turker, Turkey's ambassador to 
                      Oman. Both Turkey and Oman are making serious efforts to 
                      increase the bilateral economic co-operation. In a meeting 
                      of the Oman-Turkish Business Council in February, more than 
                      30 Turkish companies visited Oman to explore new business 
                      opportunities. The next meeting will take place in Turkey. 
                      The ambassador added that two important agreements vital 
                      for mutually beneficiary business relations, the 
                      “Avoidance of Double Taxation” and the “Protection and 
                      Promotion of Reciprocal Investments”, are paving the way 
                      to healthy business relations. He also cited that

                      dynamic forum which has been working on ways and means to

                      economic co-operation between Turkey and Oman has been 
                      growing at a faster rate. The bilateral trade between Oman 
                      and Turkey increased to $227mn in 2008, a rise of 137 per 
                      cent over 2007 figure. Items such as building materials 
                      like iron &amp; steel, and industrial products, consumer goods 
                      and food products form bulk of the trade that covers 
                      almost 300 different product categories. The trade is 
                      loaded in favour of Turkey as the country contributes more 
                      than 90 per cent of the 300 goods exchanged between the 
                      two. “In Oman, over a dozen Turkish companies are active 
                      in various industries including tourism, construction, 
                      real estate, trading etc. The total value of the contracts 
                      is over $3.5bn. Recently, a joint venture of Turkey’s TAV 
                      Construction and Athens-based Consolidated Contractors Co 
                      (CCC) got the contract worth RO450mn for the first phase 
                      of the new Muscat International Airport project. In 
                      another development, Turkish firm BOTEK (Bosphorous 
                      Technical Consulting Corporation) has got the contract for 
                      design consultancy services of the 85-km stretch of 
                      Batinah Expressway project. The contract is valued at 
                      RO2.558mn,” said HE Engin Turker, Turkey’s ambassador to 
                      Oman. Both Turkey and Oman are making serious efforts to 
                      increase the bilateral economic co-operation. In a meeting 
                      of the Oman-Turkish Business Council in February, more 
                      than 30 Turkish companies visited Oman to explore new 
                      business opportunities. The next meeting will take place 
                      in Turkey. The ambassador added that two important 
                      agreements vital for mutually beneficiary business 
                      relations, the “Avoidance of Double Taxation” and the 
                      “Protection and Promotion of Reciprocal Investments”, are 
                      paving the way to healthy business relations. He also 
                      cited that “Turkey-Oman Joint Economic Committee” is also 
                      another dynamic forum which has been working on ways and 
                      means to enrich various dimensions of bilateral economic

                      choice for tourists from all over the world. Due to its 
                      pleasant weather, natural beauty, rich history, 
                      well-developed infrastructure and outstanding hospitality,

                      Lonely Planet has described Turkey as “Landscape dotted 
                      with battlegrounds, ruined castles and the palaces of 
                      great empires. This is the land where Alexander the Great 
                      slashed the Gordion Knot, where Achilles battled the 
                      Trojans in Homer’s Iliad, and where the Ottoman Empire 
                      fought battles that would shape the world. History buffs 
                      can immerse themselves in marvels and mementos stretching 
                      back to the dawn of civilisation. Then again, if you want 
                      to simply unwind, spend an afternoon being pampered at a 
                      hamam, or let the warm waters off the Mediterranean coast 
                      lap at your toes. Adventure lovers can head east to Nemrut 
                      Dagi National Park. Bon vivants need look no further than 
                      Istanbul, where the markets and bars are among the most 
                      stylish and atmospheric, and the mod Ottoman cuisine rates 
                      as the tastiest, in the world.”<br>
                      Most visits to Turkey begin with Istanbul, the capital 
                      city of both the Byzantine and Ottoman empires. The city 
                      still retains impressive reminders of both as you take a 
                      round of it. It lies where two continents (Europe and 
                      Asia) and two seas (Black Sea and Sea of Marmara) meet. 
                      Its main artery is the Bosphorus. In the city of minarets, 
                      at every step you will be amazed by its natural beauty and 
                      historical richness.<br>
                      <br>
                      From Istanbul you can go to Princess Islands. The 
                      beautiful wooden houses and the wonderful views of the 
                      cluster of nine islands leaves an unforgettable impression 
                      on visitors. These islands, on which monasteries were 
                      built during the Byzantine period, are almost an hour away 
                      from the city. Enjoy looking at the old churches, mosques 
                      besides the summer homes of the rich and famous sitting in 
                      your horse-drawn carriages<br>
                      <br>
                      After Istanbul, you may continue your journey eastwards 
                      into the heart of Anatolia to the capital Ankara, or along 
                      the Black Sea coast, or southward along the Aegean coast 
                      to the Mediterranean. If you follow the Sea of Marmara 
                      eastward on your journey from Istanbul, the highway which 
                      circles it will bring you to Bursa. Alternatively you can 
                      make this journey in part by a ferry boat to Yalova on the 
                      southern Marmara shore and then complete the 60km to Bursa 
                      passing through the famous peach orchards of the province. 
                      It was here that first capital of the Ottoman Empire was 
                      founded by Orhan Gazi in 1326, and it is here too that 
                      amidst lovely natural surroundings you can see the first 
                      examples of typical Ottoman architectural style.<br>
                      <br>
                      Known as Green Bursa, the city is filled with gardens and 
                      parks. The place is famous for silk trade and thermal 
                      springs. Thirty-six kilometers from Bursa is Uludag, the 
                      largest center for winter sports in Turkey. It offers a 
                      variety of activities, accommodation and entertainment. 
                      The slopes are easily reached by car or cable car. 
                      December to May is the best time for skiing, although 
                      Uludag National Park is worth a visit at any time of the 
                      year for the lovely views (snowcapped mountains) and fresh 
                      air. Don’t forget to carry your woollens as the place is 
                      generally cold. On the Aegean coast, which can be reached 
                      from Bursa, you find at almost every step the remains of 
                      ancient civilizations from various periods of Anatolian 
                      history.<br>
                      <br>
                      Close to the entrance of the Canakkale Bogazi (the 
                      Dardanelles), in the province of Canakkale, is Homer’s 
                      Troy (Troia), where excavations have brought to light the 
                      riches of nine different settlements, one on top of 
                      another. The inhabitants of these nine settlements show a 
                      high level of civilization that stretches back to 3000 BC. 
                      Continue your journey through the wonderful holiday towns 
                      of Akcay, Oren, Ayvalik and Foca and you arrive at the 
                      ‘pearl’ of the Aegean, Izmir. Such is the beauty of the 
                      area, and the totally relaxing atmosphere, that the 
                      holidaymaker abandons all sense of time. Just 80 km of 
                      Izmir is Cesme, famous for its thermal waters and 
                      sparkling clear sea. In this rich region you can visit the 
                      famous ‘Arcadian Way’ in Ephesus, lined with elegant, 
                      marble columns. Nearby is the small house where the Virgin 
                      Mary is reputed to have spent her last days. Not far from 
                      both is the popular resort of Kusadasi or ‘Bird Island’, 
                      where you can rest awhile by the beautiful turquoise 
                      waters of the Aegean. From Kusadasi you can turn inland 
                      towards Denizli, which is near Pamukkale (Cotton Castle). 
                      Here, thermal spring waters laden with calcium have run 
                      off the plateau’s edge, creating a cascade of petrified 
                      basins - an extraordinary and marvelous natural work of 
                      art. The waters have been popular since Roman times for 
                      their therapeutic powers, and just behind the basins are 
                      the ruins of ancient Hierapolis.<br>
                      <br>
                      Backtracking to rejoin the Aegean road that continues 
                      southwards, we find the great Oinian cities of Priene, 
                      Miletus and Didyma, which witnessed some of the great 
                      advances of human culture. Continuing south to the Gulf of 
                      Gokova, we come to the lively and popular seaside resort 
                      of Bodrum, known in ancient times as Halicarnassus, 
                      dominated by a castle built by the Knights of Rhodes. 
                      Marmaris, further to the south, can easily be reached by 
                      road but if you really want to savour the full pleasure of 
                      this beautiful coastline, take a ‘Blue Voyage’ yacht tour. 
                      Marmaris is a tourist’s paradise set in a deep fjord-like 
                      inlet where the pine forests come right down to the 
                      shoreline of the beautiful bay lined with comfortable 
                      hotels and small guest-houses serving delicious seafood. 
                      Its fully-equipped yacht marina is able to accommodate 
                      private yachts and there are numerous yachts for charter. 
                      Endless blue sea bathed in sunshine, orange groves, banana 
                      plantations, waterfalls, forests of palm and pine that 
                      splash the foothills of the Toros mountains in a rainbow 
                      of colours with sandy beaches stretching mile after mile… 
                      this is Antalya, the tourism capital of Turkey. For those 
                      with keen interest in history, the city offers ancient 
                      theatres of Aspendos, Termessos and Side, to the many 
                      works and monuments that date back to Seljuk times. The 
                      place is very popular among tourists for its theme based 
                      deluxe resorts. In Antalya, you must visit the Mardan 
                      Palace, the most expensive hotel in entire Europe. Leaving 
                      the sunny Mediterranean behind and cutting inland into the 
                      heart of Anatolia, one arrives at the capital of modern 
                      Turkey, Ankara. The city offers the Museum of Anatolian 
                      Civilizations where relics of the world’s oldest cultures 
                      are displayed. Moving on, Konya is the home to the mystic 
                      poet and philosopher Mevlana who founded the sect of 
                      Mevlevis known to the west as the ‘Whirling Dervishes’.<br>
                      <br>
                      In the mountains of Adiyaman is Mount Nemrut, with a 
                      height of almost 2,150m, on whose peak the spectacular, 
                      toppled statues of gods lie. These were erected 2,000 
                      years ago for the Commagene King Antiochus I. Istanbul is 
                      likely to be the place where you will come back to take 
                      the flight back home. Make sure you haven’t missed out on 
                      your boat trips along the Bosphorus to enjoy the 
                      spectacular night view of Istanbul! In all likelihood 
                      while leaving Turkey you will contemplate making a 
                      comeback to the country to cover the areas that you 
                      couldn’t make it as there is so much to <br>

            Welcome to the world of low-cost, no-frills airlines. With the 
            launch of Air Arabia, billed as the regions first low-cost airline, 
            we in the Middle East are now witnessing a phenomenon that first 
            took the US' airlines industry by storm in the 1970s. Airlines like 
            Air Arabia might be following on the lines of EasyJet or Ryannair, 
            but the fact is, until now, the only other option to flying 
            expensive available to consumers in the Gulf was travelling by road. 
            And the annoying traffic jams at the national borders would 
            definitely make anyone rethink about a cheaper option of travelling 
            by road - especially when you compare the tariffs and the 
            convenience. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <b>Who's flying?</b><br>
            The USP of a low-cost airline is that it can get you from City A to 
            City B in the same time as a full-service airline will but at half 
            or sometimes even lower cost. This makes it an enticing proposition 
            for passengers travelling by road. For instance, while a person in 
            Oman pays a total of RO20.500 (RO10 for a return bus ticket and 
            RO10.500 for the visa at the border) to travel to and back from 
            Dubai, s/he has to shell out a bit more (RO34) to fly Air Arabia 
            and, eventually, save precious time at the border. The catch, 
            though, is that the airline will take you to Sharjah - and not Dubai 
            - from where you will have to make your own arrangements to drive 
            down to Dubai. However, the airline has tried to offset that hitch 
            by providing a 96-hour 'free' visa-on-arrival, which is provided 
            exclusively for the airline's passengers. </font></p>

            So are low-cost airlines like Air Arabia a threat to full-service 
            airlines like Oman Air in the country? Answers Abdulrahaman Al 
            Busaidy, chief executive, Oman Air: &quot;Mostly, low-cost airlines focus 
            on different market segments than full-service airlines. They tend 
            to focus on price-conscious passengers who are willing to give up 
            certain conveniences, e.g., meals or flying to a secondary airport, 
            to obtain lower prices. Low-cost carriers tend to operate on a 
            point-to-point basis rather than connecting passengers through a 
            hub. On the other hand, full-service airlines pursue several market 
            segments, most notably, business traffic and flow traffic that 
            connect via a hub to other destinations. The requirements for 
            satisfying the various market segments are different and airlines 
            have adopted different business models to satisfy such 
            requirements.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Busaidy is right. An executive used to the comforts and convenience 
            of business-class flying may not necessarily cross over to the 
            low-fare option while a weekend traveller or a holiday tourist, who 
            was earlier taking the journey by road, would get attracted by the 
            lower fares offered by a no-frills airline and decide to graduate to 
            air travel. As Busaidy puts it, &quot;Empirical evidence worldwide 
            indicates that low-cost carriers have created new traffic volumes 
            where they operate rather than simply take traffic from the 
            full-service airlines. In fact, they seem to divert traffic more 
            from surface transport rather than from other airlines.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &quot;At this stage, Oman Air does not view low-cost carriers as a major 
            threat since Oman Air, as a full-service airline, focuses on 
            different market segments, viz. business traffic, flow traffic and 
            inbound tourist traffic to Oman. Moreover, Oman Air has reduced the 
            threat by diversifying into new long-haul markets - e.g., East 
            Africa - and entered into a strategic alliance with Gulf Air which 
            will extend Oman Air's reach to long-haul routes through 
            code-sharing on Gulf Air's flights. On the other hand, Oman Air is 
            vigilant on its cost structure; so, it can be competitive with the 
            low-cost carriers,&quot; adds Busaidy. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <b>Competition ahoy!</b><br>
            Air Arabia took to the skies at a time when speculations were rife 
            that MenaJet, an airline privately owned by the Al-Zamil Group of 
            Saudi Arabia and Gulf Finance House of Bahrain, was about to take 
            off in the first quarter of 2004. Unfortunately, it hasn't seen the 
            light of the day and, today, Air Arabia is the only bona fide 
            low-cost airline in the region with 14 destinations to its credit. 
            That the airline is the national carrier of the UAE (fully owned by 
            His Highness Dr Sheikh Sultan Bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, Member of the 
            Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah) and is backed by the 
            government helps too.<br>
            <br>
            MenaJet, despite the delay in its takeoff, holds its claim. Mazen 
            Hajjar, chief commercial officer, MenaJet, told OER: &quot;We are looking 
            for commencement of operations very soon. We do not face a threat 
            but rather we compete with many airlines and other modes of 
            transport. We will be offering passengers a new type of product. 
            Just because there is a Beetle, people do not stop buying a BMW!&quot;<br>
            <br>
            It may be recalled what Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who launched EasyJet 
            in 1995, recently said in an interview. He spoke about the logic of 
            a low-cost airline in the Middle East, which is highly regulated: 
            &quot;It is difficult. The pace of change will depend on the willingness 
            of governments to actually deregulate. Unless you begin to get 
            people flying for next to nothing, why should you start cheering for 
            deregulation that the government has no incentive to actually give?&quot; </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <b>How cheap!</b><br>
            The no-frills product is based around online booking, a relatively 
            new way of distribution - one that is simple, quick and, most 
            importantly, cheap. These airlines rarely use travel agents (to 
            avoid paying out commissions) and actively steer passengers towards 
            online bookings and away from their call centres (to minimise cost 
            associated with staffing such centres). In addition, they do not use 
            tickets (and free themselves from the administration costs of 
            producing and accounting for them). Such practices are fundamental 
            to keeping fares low. Mike Sidhu, general manager, Shanfari Travel 
            Tourism LLC, the official agents for Air Arabia in Oman, affirms 
            that Air Arabia follows the online ticketing route. &quot;We are trying 
            to promote Internet-based ticketing so that we save up on agency and 
            distribution costs. It's also an education process - hence we also 
            have our Website address on the aircraft,&quot; he claims.<br>
            <br>
            While no-frills airlines are, indeed, less expensive than their 
            'fully-loaded' counterparts, it does not necessarily mean that they 
            offer the best value for money. These carriers often serve airports 
            that are further from the city centre than those used by 
            full-service airlines - thus requiring additional money (and time) 
            to be spent on public transport or taxis getting to the city centre. 
            Most full-service airlines (and a few no-frills carriers) use 
            airports close to the city centre. &quot;We looked at the convenience of 
            passengers and found that Sharjah airport was the best bet. It's 
            close to Dubai and the crowd gets cleared fast. We have also started 
            inter-city coach services at a nominal cost,&quot; says Sidhu.<br>
            <br>
            Moreover, low-cost carriers tend to jack up their ticket prices as 
            departure date approaches. The earlier you book, the better your 
            chances of a bargain. Air Arabia, for one, sells the tickets on a 
            policy that if the passenger is sure to fly, he must buy the ticket 
            well in advance or else pay the price for the delay. So, while a 
            Muscat-Sharjah-Muscat ticket will cost you RO20.500 if you buy one 
            well in advance, the airline can charge you RO70 in case you want to 
            catch a flight within a few hours. An interesting option that Air 
            Arabia provides is the fact that the ticket is 'transferable'. &quot;If 
            you cannot travel on your ticket, your colleague can,&quot; clarifies 
            Sidhu. But then, for every transaction and change regarding a booked 
            ticket, there's a penalty fee of RO5.</font></p>

                Air Arabia saves up about $10 (RO3.85) on the cost of tickets 
                and furthermore on the booking with CRS, because their bookings 
                are done online. The latter accounts for about $5 to $10 per 
                segment.<br>
                </font><font face="Marlett" size="1">
                h</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                Food and catering in every airline takes up huge amount and it, 
                in turn, reflects on the ticket price. Air Arabia doesn't 
                include charges for their meals in the ticket.<br>
                </font><font face="Marlett" size="1">
                h</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                Maintaining the same fleet of airlines is easier because of the 
                servicing costs. Having different kinds of aircraft means the 
                cost of maintenance also varies, thereby adding on to the 
                expenses.<br>

                h</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                Unlike other airlines, where the crew does a layover, the Air 
                Arabia crew takes the same flight back due to medium-haul 
                flights. Also, the crew stays at the hub so they save up on 
                their transportation and accommodation costs. <br>

            <b>Value (f)or money?</b><br>
            While the success of no-frills airlines appears to support the 
            airlines' claims that consumers' choice of carrier is, first and 
            foremost, price-led, there are other criteria - transfer cost/times, 
            service quality and distribution - on which passengers judge an 
            airline. &quot;Our crew is trained like any other. Although onboard meals 
            come at a price, in terms of convenience and legroom, passengers 
            benefit from a large seat pitch of 34 inches compared to 31 inches 
            in regular airlines. Our A320 is custom-made to accommodate 150 
            seats/passengers instead of the usual 165. So, we make sure that we 
            do not comprise on comfort,&quot; defends Air Arabia's Sidhu.<br>
            <br>
            It would not be surprising to see the regular airlines initiating 
            similar services, like the Gulf Traveller, an extension of Gulf Air. 
            However, as a regular passenger puts it: &quot;The Gulf Traveller is 
            still as expensive as Oman Air or Gulf Air. If I can pocket half the 
            money which I spend on any of these airlines, why shouldn't I? In 
            fact, even packages like Muscat-Sharjah-Muscat work out well as it 
            includes airfare plus a two-night stay plus complementary breakfast 
            in addition to return airport transfers! And all this, again, in 
            half the regular airline tariff.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <b>Boom or bust?</b><br>
            That brings us to the million-riyal question - will the low-cost 
            model work in this region? Surprisingly, the answer comes from Oman 
            Air's Busaidy: &quot;The low-cost model has been successful for more than 
            a decade. As long as low-cost airlines do not deviate significantly 
            from the fundamentals of the successful business model, they should 
            be around for a long time. They certainly have gained popularity 
            among passengers, investors and airports.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            However, he is quick to add a word of caution: &quot;In the Gulf area, 
            low-cost carriers will, at least initially, face a significant 
            challenge in achieving the competitive advantages enjoyed by similar 
            airlines in other parts of the world due to a low population base, 
            low computer literacy limiting sales over the Internet, limited 
            number of secondary airports and restricted access to several key 
            markets surrounding the Gulf region.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Busaidy expects the differences between the low-cost and full 
            service airlines to become narrower in the long run. &quot;Full-service 
            airlines are increasingly adopting the low-cost practice of 
            minimising sales from travel agents and sell more through the 
            Internet. On the other hand, low-cost carriers are increasingly 
            encroaching on major airports instead of only focusing on secondary 
            airports. Some full service airlines - e.g., Singapore Airlines, 
            United Airlines, and Virgin Atlantic - have gone to the extent of 
            creating their own low-cost subsidiaries to combat the threat of 
            low-cost carriers and to capitalise on new growth opportunities.&quot;
            <br>
            <br>
            No-frills or full-service airlines, whoever wins the battle for 
            supremacy in the Gulf skies, the consumer will eventually gain from 
            increased competition, lower airfares and better options.</font></p>

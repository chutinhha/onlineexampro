                    is the face of Oman's glorious banking industry. His name 
                    has today become synonymous with the bank he is the chief 
                    executive of - BankMuscat. And there are, of course, plenty 
                    of reasons just why you'll have a tough time keeping Abdul 
                    Razak Ali Issa out of any conversation that veers towards 
                    discussing the banking and finance sector in the Sultanate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For starters, with over 35 years of banking experience under 
                    his belt, he has won almost every accolade worth mentioning 
                    in the business. Talk to him about those, however, and the 
                    soft-spoken father of five will shy away from bragging about 
                    his personal laurels and quickly rattle off the awards 
                    bagged by BankMuscat under his astute stewardship. &quot;More 
                    than any awards that I may have personally received, to my 
                    mind what is of the greatest importance is the spread of 
                    awards, recognitions and laurels that we have won as an 
                    organisation over the past few years,&quot; he says unassumingly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;We hold the rare distinction of being declared the Best 
                    Bank in Oman by Euromoney, Global Finance and The Banker, 
                    three times in a row; we have been declared the Best Place 
                    to Work in Oman, in a survey two years running; the end of 
                    the year saw us being declared the Best Trade Finance Bank 
                    and Provider and Best Forex Bank and Provider by Global 
                    Finance, once again. Last month, we were declared the Best 
                    Corporate Bank and Best Retail Bank in Oman by The Banker 
                    (Middle East),&quot; he recounts effortlessly. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;All of this would not have been possible without the 
                    tireless efforts of our people and the unflinching support 
                    and confidence that our customers repose in us,&quot; continues 
                    the die-hard people's manager. It was, indeed, in 
                    recognition of the bank's performance that Issa was declared 
                    the Best CEO for 2002 by a business magazine in Oman. <br>
                    <br>
                    But before we discuss the reasons and values that propelled 
                    the bank to this position of glory, let's first look at the 
                    background of the man who made it all possible. On 
                    completion of his studies in the Sultanate of Oman in 1969, 
                    Issa started his career as a management trainee with 
                    Grindlay's Bank, where, according to him, he went on to gain 
                    considerable experience across the operations of the bank. 
                    &quot;Through the course of my career thereafter, I have had the 
                    opportunity to attend and be a part of numerous training 
                    programmes and professional courses including a Management 
                    Development Programme at Harvard University, Graduate School 
                    of Business Administration in Boston Massachusetts in 1994,&quot; 
                    he declares. <br>
                    <br>
                    His credentials established, let's move on to the more 
                    potent of the weapons in his arsenal - his beliefs. &quot;The one 
                    thing that I have come to realise and firmly believe over 
                    the 35 years that I have been a banker and have seen the 
                    banking industry in Oman grow from one dominated by 
                    international players to one that is equally, if not more 
                    strongly, represented by local banks, is that there is 
                    really no substitute for hard work!&quot; says a visibly proud 
                    Issa. <br>
                    <br>
                    And that's exactly what he expected and got his employees to 
                    do to make BankMuscat the No. 1 bank in Oman. In fact, Issa 
                    recognised the importance of the human resource early on in 
                    his career and realised that if an organisation were to 
                    succeed, more so one in a services-led industry, it had to 
                    be through its people. &quot;Many years ago, I was asked by one 
                    of my fellow industry colleagues what I thought was the 
                    greatest asset that an organisation had. I had no hesitation 
                    in saying: people,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Today, I am even firmer in 
                    my belief that it is indeed the people who make the 
                    organisation.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    However, he is quick to point out that that is not to take 
                    away from the fact that the organisation also has a role to 
                    play in this relationship. &quot;The fact is that any 
                    organisation is like a family; and as its people help lead 
                    it from strength to strength, it is the responsibility of 
                    the organisation to take care of its people, nurture their 
                    innate talents and encourage them to develop new areas of 
                    interest so that they continually evolve and become stronger 
                    professionals. It is only through this continued partnership 
                    and sustained effort to grow people that organisations 
                    continually stay abreast and hopefully, ahead of the times.&quot;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He may have said &quot;hopefully,&quot; but Issa hasn't left any stone 
                    unturned in the quest to make the employees of BankMuscat 
                    its primary and finest ambassadors. &quot;I believe my greatest 
                    assets are my people and our greatest strength, our firm 
                    belief in teamwork. The youngest clerk in one of our 
                    remotest branches, a manager in the support services 
                    function, a senior manager in one of key business 
                    departments or someone across our international operations 
                    all portray and are indeed at times, the bank itself to many 
                    people,&quot; says he. <br>
                    <br>
                    And it isn't just lip-service that he pays to the cause of 
                    employee empowerment. It is obvious that he believes in and, 
                    more importantly, has made the entire organisation believe 
                    in the power that the employees of his bank hold - 
                    individually as well as collectively. &quot;For our people to 
                    believe in this, and at times even identify personal goals 
                    with organisational goals, it is essential that they feel a 
                    sense of empowerment. This cannot happen in a centralised 
                    operations structure. We are decentralised and yet promote 
                    open channels of communication and the free exchange of 
                    ideas so that everyone concerned is aware of all 
                    developments. This also allows the senior management the 
                    flexibility to step in and provide counsel, if it is 
                    requested to do so or if it feels that there is a need, at 
                    short notice,&quot; he explains. <br>
                    <br>
                    Little wonder, then, that BankMuscat has become the 'No. 1 
                    bank' in Oman under his stewardship. So what are the 
                    benchmarks and goals that he has identified for the bank in 
                    the future? He answers: &quot;Several years ago, when drawing out 
                    a vision statement of where we wanted to be as a bank, we 
                    decided that we wanted BankMuscat to become one of the 
                    foremost banks across the region by the turn of the decade. 
                    Not necessarily, the biggest, but one of the best. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;To realise this vision, the roadmap that we set ourselves 
                    was simple: that we would continue to recognise and wherever 
                    possible, anticipate the needs of our customers and attempt 
                    to bring them the finest of banking products and solutions 
                    from across the world. This would be true not only to Oman, 
                    but wherever we operate as an organisation. I am glad to 
                    share that we are still steadfast in our belief and 
                    commitment to reach this goal.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Talking about the bank's operations, for the record, apart 
                    from having regional presence in the form of a fully 
                    operational commercial branch in Bahrain, BankMuscat also 
                    bought a 26 per cent strategic stake in Centurion Bank in 
                    2003 India, where it already had a branch in Bangalore. In 
                    fact, Issa was part of the Omani contingent that visited 
                    India recently to attend the first GCC-India Industrial 
                    Conference in Mumbai. All this seems to be part of the 
                    bank's larger game plan for the subcontinent, and in line 
                    with its stated policy of taking BankMuscat global. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Yes, India is definitely an integral part of our overall 
                    plans to grow and consolidate across the region,&quot; discloses 
                    Issa. &quot;The GCC and India have traditionally been close; this 
                    has been supported in the recent past with growing trade 
                    flows between the two and a burgeoning NRI business. Along 
                    with Centurion Bank, we propose to look at the NRI business, 
                    trade finance opportunities and investment flows between the 
                    GCC and very closely between the two countries.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    What about the growth across the region? He answers: &quot;We are 
                    keen and will continue to explore both organic and inorganic 
                    growth opportunities that come our way as far as growth 
                    across the region is concerned. As I have mentioned earlier, 
                    we would like to see ourselves as one of the foremost banks 
                    across the region by the turn of the decade.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    So is Issa an all work and no play manager? No way! &quot;I love 
                    reading, watching (and in my earlier days, playing) a lot of 
                    football and listening to music,&quot; he maintains. &quot;On the 
                    personal front, I am happily married with five children - 
                    three sons and two daughters. The eldest is working, three 
                    are studying and the other is still to go to school.&quot; </font></p>

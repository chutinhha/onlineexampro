            A 14 
            per cent increase in the average oil prices and a 6 per cent 
            increase in income from LNG saw Oman's economy end the year 2003 on 
            a positive note with the local stock market displaying bullish 
            investor sentiments and recording an increase of 42 per cent 
            year-on-year. <br>

            The OER 20 analysis and ranking by Mukhtar Hasan, based on last 
            year's financial results of Oman's largest listed companies, 
            provides a 20/20 view of the progress made by the country's top 
            blue-chips. Like last year, The OER 20 has been verified by KPMG 
            this year as well.</font></b></p>

            been positive for O</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">man's economy in general and significantly 
            bullish for the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) in particular. We saw 
            an increase in the price of oil during the year 2003 with average 
            price increasing by about 14 per cent to $27.63 (RO10.63) per 
            barrel. This price increase more than compensated the fall in oil 
            production from 897,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 824,000 bpd. 
            Moreover, 2003 also saw a 6 per cent increase in income from LNG. 
            This resulted in an improvement in the planned budgeted deficit. 
            Cash liquidity during the year eased and liquidity of stocks 
            improved substantially. Trading volumes amounted to RO593 million in 
            2003 compared to RO231 million in 2002, an increase of 157 per cent. 
            The MSM index, which started the year at 191.86 and closed it at 
            272.67 - an increase of 42 per cent - was the sixth best performing 
            Arab stock market in 2003 after the Kuwait, Saudi, Doha, Amman and 
            Dubai stock exchanges. <br>
            <br>
            During the course of 2003, all the listed companies adopted the 
            corporate governance regulations introduced by the Capital Market 
            Authority in 2002. This, together with excess liquidity and soft 
            interest rates, has no doubt played a part in the bullish 
            performance of the stock market during 2003 for maximising 
            shareholder value. The government continued its emphasis of 
            diversifying the economy away from dependence on oil. Several mega 
            projects were launched including the Sohar Port, Sohar Refinery, 
            Chemical Fertiliser plant, Batinah Power Plant etc., some of which 
            have already gone into the construction phase. <br>
            <br>
            The government continued to pursue its privatisation policy. 
            Important developments in privatisation initiatives include power, 
            telecommunications, water, airports, ports, wastewater, postal and 
            surface transport sectors. Substantial progress has been made during 
            2003 with regard to tourism. The easing of visas should have a major 
            impact on this industry in the future. <br>
            <br>
            On the international scene, after the traumatic losses of the last 
            three years, the decisive rebound in 2003 helped make up for some of 
            the losses investors have suffered from 2000 through 2002. All the 
            main indices showed handsome gains of between 25 and 50 per cent. 
            The year started on a cautious note but the mood changed quickly 
            after the end of the Iraq war in March. A significant turnaround in 
            the US economy was achieved with the assistance of a 45-year low in 
            interest rates, the new tax-stimulus package and the weak US dollar. 
            During 2003, the revenues of Oman's 20 largest companies showed a 
            modest growth. Total revenues for The OER 20 went up by 1.5 per cent 
            to RO887 million. After a good corporate performance of 2002, 
            overall, the profits for 2003 decreased dramatically by 41 per cent 
            to RO53 million from the figure of RO90 million last year. The main 
            reason for this dismal performance was the substantial loss of RO52 
            million posted by National Bank of Oman, which completely distorts 
            the overall figure. If this loss is excluded from the total profit 
            numbers, the performance of the other companies would show a growth 
            of 17 per cent to RO105 million. <br>
            <br>
            The average P/E ratio of The OER 20 based on the profits of 2003 and 
            the share price on April 15, 2004, is 25.9 times earnings. Once 
            again, this number is greatly distorted due to the substantial loss 
            of NBO. After removing the NBO loss, the average PE works out to 
            13.1 times</font></p>

            top five companies in Oman remain unchanged from last year, except 
            for OAS going up one place to fourth position and Oman Oil (formerly 
            BP) going down to fifth place. It is concerning to note that four of 
            the top five companies have shown a decline in revenue for 2003. 
            Shell Oman Marketing Company continues to remain by far the largest 
            public company in Oman. The company showed a negative growth of 4.83 
            per cent during the year 2003. The chairman of the company, Dr 
            Andrew Wood, in his report to the shareholders explains that 2003 
            has been a challenging year. The security situation in the region 
            combined with the SARS outbreak in the Far East influenced a number 
            of key factors. <br>
            <br>
            Dr Wood states that the completion of the gas pipeline project that 
            brought gas to the south of the country, while a significant 
            national achievement, led to a sharp decline of liquid fuels demand 
            in the commercial fuels market. Meanwhile, high crude oil prices 
            worldwide caused a steep rise in the base oil import prices and had 
            a significant effect on the overall results. Dr Wood stated that 
            despite the downward pressure, the company delivered encouraging 
            results close to last year's performance. <br>
            <br>
            Shell has declared a dividend of 600 baiza per share, the same as 
            the last two years - a dividend yield of 8.63 per cent. Dr Wood 
            cautioned the shareholders that the adverse trends in market fuels 
            volumes would leave a gap in the projected performance for 2004. 
            Although the company will continue its growth mode, the profit for 
            2004 is expected to decline. Achieving profitability similar to that 
            of 2003 will realistically only be possible over the next 2-4 years, 
            driven through growth in the retail business.</font></p>

            the year. BankMuscat was once again the most profitable company in 
            Oman as well as the second largest company in the country based on

            India, and acquired the loan portfolio of Citibank in Muscat. The 
            bank was yet again declared 'Best Bank in Oman' by three

            shareholders states that it has been a remarkable year for the 
            company. The company encountered major challenges and significant 
            opportunities, and responded positively to deliver good results, 
            improved shareholder value and healthy cash flows. Fancy states that

            result of the year. The company's investments in building, owning 
            and operating facilities for oilfied contractors have proven their 
            worth. The business has delivered growth again this year and 
            provided the foundation for the company to pre-qualify and compete

            Oman International Bank (OIB) is the second highest capitalised 
            company in Oman. Reem Omar Zawawi, the chairperson, states in her 
            report to the shareholders that the bank completed its 20th 
            anniversary during 2003. Zawawi states that the bank's performance 
            for the year was encouraging. The operating profit for 2003 was 
            RO15.46 million compared to RO16.86 million in 2002. This decrease 
            was anticipated in view of the bank's decision to implement 
            stringent credit risk management principles to ensure a significant 
            improvement is asset quality. <br>
            <br>
            The bank's success in recovering several major non-performing loans 
            totalling RO13.5 million resulted in a bottomline impact of RO5.7 
            million, a significant contribution. Zawawi goes on to say that the 
            strategy of focusing on improved credit quality led the bank to exit 
            a number of relationships that did not meet their credit standards. 
            Accordingly, the Loans and Advances stood at RO388.02 million as at 
            December 31, 2003, compared to RO403.96 million as at December 31, 
            2002. Total Deposits stood at RO472.73 million as at December 31, 
            2003, compared to RO458.90 million as at December 31, 2002. <br>
            <br>
            The bank's board proposed a cash dividend of 21 per cent for 2003. 
            Looking forward, Zawawi is confident that the prudent macro economic 
            policies of the government of the Sultanate will provide ample 
            opportunities for banks to meet the needs of their customers. <br>
            <br>
            Zawawi adds that this, together with the solid business franchise 
            that the bank enjoys in Oman, leads the board to believe that OIB 
            will be successful in expanding and developing its business, and 
            thereby continuing to contribute to the progress of the nation.

            again, four of the top five companies in Oman having the largest 
            market capitalisation are banks. The chairman of NBO, Khalfan Bin 
            Nasser Al Wohaibi, in his report to the shareholders has stated that 
            it is a source of ongoing regret that throughout 2003, the magnitude 
            of the problems of the years 2001 and 2002 continued to predominate 
            over the operating profitability of the bank. The overall outcome of 
            the bank's operations for 2003 was a net loss of RO51.776 million 
            compared to a net loss of RO0.262 million reported in 2002. Al 
            Wohaibi explains that these results were primarily influenced, for 
            the third consecutive year, by a heavy level of provisioning for 
            impaired indebtedness aggregating to RO70.7 million. <br>
            <br>
            Al Wohaibi states that in terms of balance-sheet evolution, deposits 
            grew by 4.9 per cent while the loan portfolio was reduced by RO81.7 
            million as part of the qualitative improvement exercise to forestall 
            the likelihood of further impaired indebtedness arising in the 
            future. Al Wohaibi adds that notwithstanding these very 
            disappointing results, the bank's capital strength was enhanced 
            during the year by the subscription of 24,195,406 additional shares 
            with a nominal value of RO1 at a premium of 120 per cent by Suhail 
            Bahwan Group (Holding) LLC. Al Wohaibi confirms that throughout 
            2004, the bank will focus on the twin strategies of prudent 
            profitable business development and dynamic remedial management so 
            as to enhance value for their shareholders and all the other 
            stakeholders. </font></p>

            as well as the exceptional results attained by the company were 
            outstanding by all standards. Total premium income for 2003 amounted 
            to RO35.87 million compared to RO37.29 million for 2002. <br>
            <br>
            Shanfari goes on to say that the imposition of strict terms by the 
            re-insurers in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, has led the 
            company to adopt a new strategy to increase its retention capacity. 
            To enable this strategy to work, the company adopted an increase in 
            the share capital by 25 per cent through an issue of bonus shares, 
            thus increasing the paid-up capital to RO9.375 million. The 
            company's board has recommended a 25 per cent cash dividend for the 
            year. Shanfari states that the increase in the share capital will

            provide better underwriting facilities to retain higher portion of

            top five earnings per share growth companies are identical to the 
            top five by growth of profit. The chairman of ONIC Holding, Salim 
            bin Hassan Macki, has stated in his report to the shareholders that 
            during the year-ended March 2003, the Steering Committee continued 
            its mission to restructure the company and bring it on a stable 
            footing for future years. Macki stated that the company restructured 
            its capital and negotiated a settlement agreement with Al Yousef. 
            Macki adds that the initiatives have enabled the company to achieve 
            satisfactory results, which were largely due to profits from 
            subsidiary companies, write-back of provisions and revaluation of 
            investments. The Committee recommended a 9 per cent cash dividend 
            for the year. Macki adds that the company is poised for further 
            growth and profitability in the years ahead. </font></p>

            share price growth of the top five companies exceeded the average 
            growth of the MSM index of 42 per cent. Dhofar Insurance is on top 
            of the list of companies registering the best share price growth in 
            the year 2003. The chairman of Ominvest, Taya Bin Jandal Bin Ali, 
            has stated in his report to the shareholders that during 2003, 
            accommodative monetary policies were adopted worldwide to ward off 
            deflation and to boost growth. These measures enabled the US and 
            other global markets to stabilise and generate favourable 
            environment for investments. <br>
            <br>
            In Oman, the growth in the economy outpaced budgeted projections and 
            this was reflected by a vibrant stock market. Jandal adds that in 
            this positive environment, the group's investments performed 
            creditably and the profit for 2003 recorded a 54.38 per cent 
            increase over 2002. Jandal states that their major subsidiary, Oman 
            Arab Bank, reported improved results, which were attributable to 
            substantial increase in interest margins, and gains from MSM-related 
            investments. The board has recommended a 30 per cent cash dividend 
            for the year. Jandal is hopeful that relatively stable oil prices 
            and low interest rates should again generate favourable business 
            conditions in Oman and elsewhere. The group should, therefore, 
            perform satisfactorily and would report a profitable year in 2004.

            Power Co. (UPC) ranks No. 1 in terms of dividend yield offered to 
            its shareholders. The chairman of UPC, Murtadha Ahmed Sultan, in his 
            report to the shareholders has stated that the Manah Power Plant has 
            been running smoothly and efficiently. The five generator sets of 
            the project were operated without problem and showed reliability and 
            performances expected for such hi-tech machines. The company's board 
            has recommended a cash dividend of RO2.267 million, which brings the 
            total ordinary dividend for the year to 13 per cent.</font></p>

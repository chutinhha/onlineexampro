<img border="0" src="WORLD_SCAN01.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" style="border: 2px solid #EFEFE9; " vspace="4">Eye-care 
company Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc, still dealing with widespread product recalls that 
have delayed financial reports, has said it had agreed to be acquired by private 
equity firm Warburg Pincus for about US$3.67 billion. Under the deal, Warburg 
Pincus will acquire all outstanding shares of Bausch &amp; Lomb common stock at 
US$65 per share in cash. It will also assume about US$830 million in debt. The 
offer was at a 5.7 per cent premium to where Bausch &amp; Lomb shares closed on the 
day the deal was announced. However, the eye-care company’s share prices had 
been on a sharp ascent for several weeks due to rumours that it would be the 
target of a leveraged buyout.<br>
<br>
Warburg Pincus’ offer is nearly 28 times the estimated 2007 earnings per share 
for Bausch &amp; Lomb, and 9.5 times the estimated 2007 earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortisation, based on data from Reuters Estimates.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="80%" size="1">

		</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Private equity firm Cerberus will buy a majority of DaimlerChrysler’s 
		struggling Chrysler Group for $7.4 billion, a fraction of the 
		US$36-billion paid nine years earlier to create the transatlantic car 
		union. Cerberus Capital Management gets an 80.1 per cent stake in 
		Chrysler and its related financial services business, DaimlerChrysler 
		said, ending what was billed as a marriage made in heaven but one that 
		never lived up to the name.<br>
		<br>
		The deal, months in the making and set to close in the third quarter of 
		the year, puts a major US automaker in the hands of a private equity 
		group for the first time. “Cerberus is the right strategic buyer for 
		Chrysler, with a long-term commitment to Chrysler’s growth and success. 
		They are committed to working constructively with both union leadership 
		and Chrysler’s management team to help Chrysler realise its full 
		potential,” Chrysler President Tom LaSorda said.<br>
		<br>
		He said the deal would not trigger job cuts beyond the 13,000 Chrysler 
		had announced in February, when it unveiled a US$1.5-billion 2006 
		operating loss as customers, spooked by high fuel prices, fled from its 
		portfolio of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.<br>
		<br>
		The accord calls for Chrysler to retain billions of dollars in pension 
		and healthcare obligations for its workers and will result in a net cash 
		outflow of US$677 million for DaimlerChrysler, now the world’s 
		fifth-biggest carmaker. The German company – whose name will change to 
		Daimler AG if shareholders approve – will contribute another US$875 
		million to cover long-term liabilities at Chrysler, it said.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="80%" size="1">

European aerospace giant EADS suffered a $13.5 million first-quarter net loss, 
reflecting restructuring costs at its crisis-hit aircraft unit Airbus. EADS said 
its first quarter performance this year had been affected by the provision of 
US$926 million to finance a vast restructuring at Airbus, dubbed Power8, that 
will result in the loss of about 10,000 jobs.<br>
<br>
Operating earnings before exceptional items and goodwill writedowns fell by 89 
per cent from the first quarter of 2006 to US$120 million. Airbus, bedevilled by 
costly production and delivery delays in its flagship A380 superjumbo programme, 
reported a first-quarter operating loss of US$93 million after net profit of 
US$920 million in the same period last year.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="80%" size="1">

<font face="Verdana" size="1">The Asian Development Bank faces an uncertain future after failing to reach a 
clear consensus on how to reform in response to Asia’s rapid but increasingly 
uneven economic growth. The 67-member ADB wrapped up its annual meeting in Kyoto 
recently amid disquiet among many members about proposals for the multilateral 
lending institution to focus more on the needs of middle-income countries. While 
delegates were generally in favour of an overhaul to ensure the bank’s continued 
relevance, many urged the ADB not to lose sight of its original mandate to lift 
millions of Asians out of poverty. “While a larger number of countries in the 
region will become middle-income countries, some will remain low-income 
countries,” Cambodia’s ADB governor Keat Chhon warned. “There will still be a 
significant number of poor in the region. Our view is that the ADB should 
continue to focus on poverty alleviation in these low-income economies.”

<img border="0" src="WORLD_SCAN02.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" style="border: 2px solid #EFEFE9; " vspace="4">Thomson 
		has won approval for its US$17.6-billion takeover of Reuters from the 
		British company’s editorial watchdog, but the deal now faces scrutiny 
		from anti-trust regulators and unions unhappy about expected job cuts. 
		The renamed Thomson-Reuters Corp. will reduce the number of major 
		companies providing financial data, news and trading systems to just two 
		and vault it slightly ahead of the current market leader, privately held 
		Bloomberg LP.<br>
		<br>
		The backing of trustees of the Reuters Founders Share Company was a 
		crucial first step in creating the world’s largest financial news 
		provider. The trust, which controlled what is known as a “golden share”, 
		was set up when Reuters listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984 to 
		safeguard editorial independence. “We believe that the formation of 
		Thomson-Reuters marks a watershed in the global information business,” 
		said Swedish businessman Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman of the trustee 
		company, whose directors have the power to order any shareholder whose 
		holding exceeds 15 per cent to reduce stake. The Thomson family of 
		Canada, which will have a 53 per cent majority stake, agreed to adopt 
		the Reuters Trust Principles as long as it controls Thomson-Reuters, the 
		companies said. Reuters Chief Executive Tom Glocer, who will head the 
		combined company, said that some “realignment” is likely to occur to 
		meet a goal of US$500 million in cost reductions over three years. But 
		he played down the prospect of large-scale job cuts, pointing to the 
		fact that Reuters has already made cost savings totalling around US$1.8 
		billion over the past five years.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><br>

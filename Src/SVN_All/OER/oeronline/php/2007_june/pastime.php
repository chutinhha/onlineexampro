Mathur’s calm countenance belies the fact that he is mentally crisscrossing the 
skies all the time. As Country Manager, Indian Airlines in Oman, he carries the 
responsibility of making sure that everything flies smoothly. Sarada 
Vishnubhatla meets him over a cup of green tea</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="passtime.jpg" width="175" height="191" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">One 
crisp morning Aditya Mathur agrees to meet me and over a cup of aromatic Assam 
green tea, I ask him about his pastimes, knowing that each one of us adopts some 
way or the other to unwind at the end of each day. Aditya, smiling till then, 
suddenly looks serious. I wonder if anything is wrong with the query. Sensing 
the thought process, Aditya clarifies quickly, “I am thinking. You know, I am 
never casual about anything in my life. So I have to think hard to give you the 
right answer.” It turns out that he has more than one method of relaxation. <br>
<br>
His work is definitely a passion for him. Meeting people, listening to melodious 
music and spending time with his family relax him. His love for Oman is his 
biggest plus. Aditya has travelled extensively both in Oman and abroad. “Muscat 
is home away from home. I love Oman and it’s wonderful. I have travelled far and 
wide,” he says.<br>
<br>
Aviation is in his blood. After spending 28 years in the field, he perfectly 
understands the pulse of it. He spends considerable time with his ground staff 
too. Sometimes making random visits at the airport and interacting with 
passengers gives him a reality check. Knots quickly unravel for him and he makes 
mental notes that will be discussed later on in the confines of his office with 
his staff. Soft spoken and ever ready to help, Aditya follows a strict rule in 
office. His office door is never closed. His staff can walk in any moment and 
discuss issues with him.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Being a peoples’ person, he thrives on occasions where he can meet people. He 
confesses that he never misses such an opportunity. Being in large gatherings, 
connecting with people and talking shop with them and otherwise too help him 
stay in tune with the demands of the market. <br>
<br>
Closing his eyes, he thinks hard again till the phone rings in urgently. 
Attending to a distress call, Aditya quickly dons the mantle of authority and 
facilitates arrangements needed at the hour. Whether the caller is known, a 
high-up executive of a company or a complete stranger, his demeanour remains the 
same. Aditya makes sure that he helps out to the best of his ability. He returns 
to our conversation and says, “Listening to my wife talk about things close to 
her heart gives me much energy. Also, I make it a point to sit with my son and 
know him better as he grows up – be it his career plans or friends. I am there 
when he wishes to talk.” <br>
<br>
A total workaholic, Aditya informs that melodious music soothes him. The only 
luxury he can afford during his tightly packed work schedule is to switch on the 
CD-man. Favourite singers crooning old numbers prepare him for the rush hours of 
the day. Surfing the net for sites on his favourite subjects of aviation and 
health keep him abreast of fast changing situations.</font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

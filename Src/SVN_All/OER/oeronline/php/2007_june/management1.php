</font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><b>Bridging the skills gap<br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>During recent years we have heard 
the expression, ‘recruit for attitude and train for skills.’ Yet, most 
organisations do not take this approach. Paul Bridle, a leadership 
methodologist, delves into the burning issues of skill shortages, recruitment 
and retention<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="manag1.jpg" width="139" height="340" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">We 
are living at a time when skill shortages are becoming a problem in most places 
in the world. It seems that every newspaper or journal has an article about 
recruitment, retention or skill shortages. Figures show that the issue is a 
major problem all over the world. <br>
<br>
A recent report from KPMG stated that over 60 per cent of the employers in 
London are facing skills shortages. At the same time, according to an estimate, 
the average cost of filling a vacancy is £4,800.<br>
<br>
In the US, I was given some statistics showing that 40 per cent of the workforce 
in US will be of retirement age by 2010 and a fifth of large US companies will 
loose at least 40 per cent of their top talent as executives reach retirement 
age.<br>
<br>
Statistics also showed that 68 per cent of people blamed poor selection and 
promotions as the cause of lower productivity and 66 per cent said it resulted 
in lower productivity. In UK, four out of five employees surveyed said they do 
not feel ‘engaged’ in their work and this could equate to £46 billion in lost 
productivity and working days!<br>
<br>
At two management conferences I have attended in the last quarter, the main 
subject to the management team has been how to deal with skill shortages, 
recruitment and retention.<br>
<br>
<b>Shifting attitudes<br>
</b>All this is happening against a backdrop of an emerging new generation that 
has a different attitude to work and career. Two trends that have come out in 
the last year point to the average university student having three to five 
careers in their working life and changing jobs every two to five years!<br>
<br>
So what is needed is a different way of looking at the problem of retention and 
certainly recruitment will need to change significantly.<br>
<br>
Is it left to the Human Resources department to deal with or, is it something 
that the Board is taking an active interest in? Do you have a ‘Strategy’ for 
recruitment? I don’t mean an approach, but a strategy as to how you plan to deal 
with the recruitment of people over the next three to five years. The 
recruitment strategy should be aligned to the business plan and come out of the 
business plan.<br>
<br>
During recent years we have heard the expression, ‘recruit for attitude and 
train for skills’. Yet I find that most organisations do not take this approach. 
Worse, I find that organisations think they have to pick from the applications 
they receive instead of looking to find the right person.<br>
<br>
The most progressive organisations I have come across are so clear about the 
attitude they need, that they are even working with recruitment agencies (and 
even schools) to help develop people that are ‘employable’ in the future.<br>
<br>
So I ask you to think about the following questions:</font><ul>

  <font face="Verdana" size="1">Do you rigorously monitor the person to make

  leave it until it is too late and then you have to deal with the person 
  through disciplinary actions. </font></li>

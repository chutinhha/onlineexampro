		<b>The trade surplus of GCC countries is forecast to hit US$585 billion 
		and the GDP to touch US$750 billion indicating the rising level of 
		economic activity in the region</b><br>
		<br>
<img border="0" src="gcc_dairy.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" style="border: 2px solid #EFEFE9; " vspace="4" width="300" height="141">The 
		combined current account surpluses of the GCC countries is projected to 
		surge to US$585 billion in the 2005-2007 period as a result of higher 
		export earnings. According to SAMBA Financial Group of Saudi Arabia, the 
		new record GCC surplus would be higher than that of the next two 
		economies – China with a projected US$521-billion surplus and Japan with 
		a projected US$437-billion surplus.<br>
		<br>
		Data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) show a nearly 
		10-fold increase in GCC current account surpluses from 2002 through 
		2006. The IIF’s estimate of last year’s GCC current account surplus of 
		US$227-billion compares with the IMF’s estimated US$571-billion current 
		account surplus for all oil exporters, including Russia, Norway and 
		Mexico.<br>
		<br>
		IIF said that on the back of this record surplus, the foreign assets of 
		the GCC had risen since the beginning of this decade by US$400 billion, 
		and now surpass US$1 trillion, with the lion’s share being held by state 
		investment funds. “There are estimates that already for some of the 
		smaller GCC members’, earnings from investments are on par with or may 
		even exceed earnings from hydrocarbons.”<br>
		<br>
		According to IIF estimates, from the beginning of 2006 through 2007, the 
		GCC countries would purchase more than US$450 billion in foreign assets, 
		complementing the inward bias of overall investment expenditures. “Given 
		the already robust official foreign assets of the oil producers, with 
		their individual capital accounts in surplus, this is not surprising. 
		With little information available, it is difficult to pinpoint the size 
		of the international portfolios of government agencies, let alone their 
		rate of growth.”<br>
		<br>
		In its forecast, SAMBA said Saudi Arabia, after recording its eighth 
		consecutive current account surplus in 2006 – a record US$95.5 billion – 
		would, however, see a drop this year. The bank said imports would grow 
		at a similar rate to last year, but oil export revenues would decline 
		due to a softer oil market. “As a result, merchandise imports will equal 
		about one-half, rather than one-third, of the value of exports. With 
		transfers, such as worker remittances, and trade in services taken into 
		account, we forecast a current account surplus for 2007 of US$58 
		billion, 39 per cent lower than the 2006 surplus. Even the International 
		Monetary Fund has said the Gulf oil-producing economies were expected to 
		grow at a slightly slower pace, with their gross domestic product 
		surging to $749.6 billion while recording a decline in surplus in 2007 
		as oil prices and output drop. In its Regional Economic Outlook, the IMF 
		said that region would, however, remain resilient to shocks. Mohsin Khan 
		of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia department, said only Saudi 
		Arabia – the largest economy in the Middle East and Central Asia – was 
		expected to register a slightly higher real growth of 4.8 per cent, 
		compared to 4.6 per cent in 2006. The GDPs of the UAE and Qatar would 
		see a real growth of 8.2 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, compared 
		to 9.7 per cent and 8.8 per cent, respectively, in 2006. Kuwait’s GDP 
		growth would drop from 5 per cent in 2006 to 3.5 per cent while 
		Bahrain’s economy would drop from 7.7 per cent in 2006 to 6.9 per cent. 
		Oman’s GDP would grow at almost the same pace as last year, increasing 
		from 5.9 per cent to 6 per cent in 2007.<br>
		<br>
		Khan said in value terms all GCC economies, except Kuwait, would 
		register a higher GDP. The Kuwaiti economy would see a drop from US$96.1 
		billion in 2006 to US$95.4 billion. The size of the Saudi economy was 
		expected to reach US$354.9 billion, compared to US$348.6 billion in 2006 
		while the UAE’s GDP would reach US$186.2 billion compared to US$168.5 
		billion the previous year. Qatar would also see its economy expanding to 
		US$57.3 billion from US$52.7 billion registered in 2006. Bahrain and 
		Oman-the only non-OPEC members in the GCC – were expected to see their 
		economies growing to US$17.5 billion and US$38.3 billion, respectively, 
		compared to US$16.1 billion and US$36 billion in 2006. In total, the GDP 
		in the GCC would grow nominally from US$718 billion in 2006 to US$749.6 
		billion in 2007.<br>
		<br>
		The IMF official said that non-oil GDP continues to grow in Gulf 
		countries, pointing out that it should be factored in while assessing 
		their economic performance. “Non-oil GDP has been growing very rapidly. 
		It will still be growing despite the drop in oil-GDP growth. It grew 
		notably by 11.1 per cent in 2006 in the UAE and was expected to grow by 
		10.1 per cent in 2007, while in Saudi Arabia it is expected to grow 6.9 
		per cent in 2007, compared to 7.3 per cent in 2006.”</font></p>

<img border="0" src="gcc1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" style="border-style:solid; border-color:#EFEFE9; " vspace="4" width="175" height="161">Saudi Aramco and US’ Dow Chemical Co. have announced a deal to build a 
		petrochemical plant that industry insiders expect to be the largest 
		foreign investment in Saudi Arabia’s energy sector. The cost of the Ras 
		Tanura plastics and chemicals complex would be “mammoth”, said Saudi 
		Aramco’s President Abdallah Jumah, declining to give details. Aramco and 
		Dow signed a memorandum of understanding and will now enter a final 
		negotiation phase for the formation of a joint company to build, own and 
		operate the plant.<br>
        <br>
		Earlier, industry sources said the plant would have an investment cost 
		of at least US$20 billion. Soaring inflation has taken its toll of the 
		costs, which Aramco had last year estimated at around US$15 billion. Ras 
		Tanura will be one of the biggest plants of its kind, the two companies 
		said in a joint statement from Aramco’s headquarters in Dhahran.<br>
		<br>
		“When fully operational, the new complex will be one of the largest 
		grassroots plastics and chemicals production facilities in the world and 
		will be ideally positioned to serve major world markets,” the statement 
		said. The companies plan to float a 30 per cent stake in Ras Tanura and 
		raise the rest through debt, Jumah said. The investment is Dow’s largest 
		in the region and its biggest joint venture, said Chief Executive Andrew 
		Liveris. “We have other investments in the Middle East… but nothing 
		rivals the scale, size and breadth of this project. (It is) the largest 
		proposed joint venture in our 110-year history.”<br>
		<br>
		Dow is the largest US chemical maker by sales and has faced tough 
		competition from Middle East chemical producers, such as Saudi Arabia’s 
		Sabic, which have access to cheap crude and natural gas. Sabic is the 
		world’s largest chemicals company by market value. Sabic, along with 
		other companies, was invited to bid for Ras Tanura but was unsuccessful, 
		Jumah said.</font></p>

		Gulf’s finance hub<br>
		</b><br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc2.jpg" width="175" height="137" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Bahrain has launched a US$1.5-billion financial development programme as 
		part of its attempts to reassert itself as the natural financial centre 
		of the oil-rich Gulf region, taking on competition from Dubai, Qatar and 
		Saudi Arabia. The opening of Bahrain Financial Harbour’s first phase, 
		offering 60,000 sq.m office space, coincides with the country’s central 
		bank’s efforts to fine-tune regulations to attract financial firms, 
		especially those focusing on Islamic banking, asset management and 
		insurance.<br>
		<br>
		The Kingdom, which took on the mantle of the regional financial hub from 
		Beirut in the 1970s, has in recent years watched a string of 
		international names moving to Dubai International Financial Centre and 
		Qatar Financial Centre.<br>
		<br>
		Saudi Arabia, the region’s largest oil-driven economy, is also courting 
		international finance, doubling the number of banks and licensing more 
		than 50 investment banks and brokerages in the past few years, 
		threatening Bahrain’s role as the country’s offshore banking hub. 
		Financial firms are investing in the Gulf to chase business associated 
		with increasing petrodollars that have seen the Gulf states’ foreign 
		reserves growing by about US$155 billlion a year over the past three 
		years, according to Saudi Arabia’s SAMBA Financial Group. With projects 
		worth US$1,000 billion planned in the region, banks are seeking 
		financing opportunities as the Gulf uses oil surpluses to build 
		infrastructure. New regulations encouraging alternative investment 
		firms, such as hedge funds, are expected to be passed in Bahrain within 
		days, says Rasheed Mohammed al-Maraj, Bahrain’s central bank governor. 
		The central bank has fostered the development of Islamic financial 
		products by leading the issuance of Islamic bonds and will soon 
		introduce new products to help the sector.<br>
		<br>
		Stephen Rothel, Bahrain Financial Harbour’s chief executive, said a 
		significant portion of the first building has received leasing 
		commitments from interested firms, including local institutions and 
		Dexia Asset Management of Luxembourg. Also interested is Bramdean, which 
		was considering setting up a regional base in Bahrain for asset 
		management services, said its chief executive Nicola Horlick.<br>
		<br>
		Jane Dellar, managing director of Bahrain Financial Services 
		Development, part of Bahrain’s Economic Development Board, says the 
		Kingdom is growing from a solid base, having already licensed 391 
		financial services firms, more than Dubai and Qatar.<br>
		<br>
		But competition from neighbouring Dubai is strong, with most main 
		investment banks opening their headquarters in the Dubai International 
		Financial Centre, using the tax-free zone as a launch pad for serving 
		the region. Qatar has developed a more inwardly focused centre, aiming 
		to create a domestic financial services sector to serve its rapidly 
		growing, gas-fuelled economy.<br>
		<br>
		A key target for the new development is Royal Bank of Scotland, which 
		has received a licence to operate in Bahrain but is also opening offices 
		in two other Gulf states, and has yet to define its regional base.</font></p>

		Abu Dhabi has launched the world’s first zero-carbon, zero-waste city. 
		Only companies engaged in renewable and clean energy, as well as science 
		and technology will be allowed to operate from this region, and will 
		enjoy 100 per cent foreign ownership rights and other attractive 
		incentives. “The attraction for businesses includes a one-stop-shop

		Masdar, a subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company, the investment arm 
		of the Government of Abu Dhabi. The 6 sq. km energy, science and 
		technology community to be provided with solar energy will open in late 
		2009.<br>
		<br>
		The development is a unique, integrated ‘green community’ in the heart 
		of Abu Dhabi, which uses traditional planning principles of a walled 
		city, together with existing technologies to achieve a zero-carbon and 
		zero-waste sustainable development. The city will house the Masdar 
		Institute of Science and Technology, the graduate science and research 
		institute currently being established in cooperation with MIT; research 
		facilities; world-class laboratories; commercial space for 
		related-sector companies; light manufacturing facilities; and a 
		carefully selected pool of international tenants who will invest, 
		develop and commercialise advanced energy technologies. The city will 
		also host Masdar’s offices, residential space for employees, as well as 
		a science museum and edutainment facilities.<br>
		<br>
		Masdar CEO, Sultan Al Jaber said: “There is nothing like this in the 
		world. We are creating a synergetic environment; it is a true 
		alternative energy cluster, where you will find researchers, students, 
		scientists, business investment professionals, and policy makers all 
		within the same community.” He said the zero-carbon zero-waste city 
		would be a living example of sustainable development that would position 
		Abu Dhabi and Masdar at the forefront of intelligent resource 
		utilisation. “It will combine the talent, expertise and resources to 
		enable the technological breakthroughs necessary for truly sustainable 
		development.”<br>
		<br>
		The city will be car free, powered by renewable energy with services 
		digitally managed and providing real time information. With a maximum 
		distance of 200 m to the nearest transport link and amenities, the 
		compact network of streets will encourage walking. Shaded walkways and 
		narrow streets will create a pedestrian friendly environment in the 
		context of Abu Dhabi’s extreme climate. Surrounding land will contain 
		wind, photovoltaic farms, research fields and plantations, enabling the 
		city to be entirely self-sustaining.</font></p>

		peg<br>
		</b><br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc4.jpg" width="190" height="88" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Ending months of speculation, Kuwait has abandoned its four-year old 
		currency peg to the US dollar in a move that is expected to trigger 
		renewed calls from monetary experts in the UAE and other GCC countries, 
		reeling under imported inflation resulting from a tumbling greenback, to 
		follow suit.<br>
		<br>
		The Kuwaiti Central Bank’s move to switch the dinar exchange rate 
		mechanism to a basket of currencies, although aimed at softening its 
		spiralling domestic inflation, is feared to further delay the GCC 
		monetary union which is already poised to miss the 2010 deadline, 
		analysts say.<br>
		<br>
		Kuwait, the third-largest Arab oil producer, ditched the dinar’s peg 
		against the dollar in favour of a basket of currencies, which it 
		abandoned in 2003 to prepare for the GCC monetary union. While the move 
		was long expected to stave off the negative impact of a declining 
		dollar, it caught markets and fellow central bankers unawares.<br>
		<br>
		An economist said other countries in the region which are suffering from 
		their alliance to a sliding dollar should start moving in the same 
		direction. Shaikh Sultan bin Saud Al Qassimi, Chairman of Capital 
		Industries Investment and Barjeel-Geojit Securities described the Kuwait 
		Central Bank move as wonderful. “It is time the UAE start switching its 
		currency peg away from the dollar to a basket of currencies. We have 
		been undecided about this for the past two years. As the dollar is 
		expected to continue its slide for at least two years, we should move 
		without further delay,” he said.<br>
		<br>
		Kuwait’s surprise move came in the wake of International Monetary Fund 
		ruling out such a possibility until 2010. Earlier, Mohsin Khan, IMF 
		director for the Middle East and Central Asia, reported as saying that a 
		depegging from dollar was not good for the region’s financial stability. 
		“We believe that it is inevitable for Gulf currencies to stay with the 
		dollar peg until the currency union, which I have no reason to think not 
		possible by 2010,” he said. “Gulf states should not alter their currency 
		pegs, which will do little to curb inflation and might threaten 
		perceptions of Gulf currencies as stable,” he has said.<br>
		<br>
		However, Kuwait’s central bank governor said his country was still 
		committed to monetary union and was only acting in the “national 
		interest” to contain inflation. “Until the completion of all the 
		requirements to achieve the currency union and the launch of the Gulf 
		currency, the Central Bank of Kuwait will continue to adopt the basket 
		system.” If the currency basket mirrored the sources of Kuwait’s top 
		merchandise imports, it would roughly consist of 46 percent dollars, 29 
		percent euros, 15 percent yen and 10 percent sterling.</font></p>

		</b><br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc6.jpg" width="175" height="160" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">By 2020, Qatar hopes to have zero-dependence on oil and gas revenues as 
		it moves to diversify its economy, according to its Minister of Finance 
		HE Yousuf Hussein Kamal. And by 2015, the country will have worked 
		towards its target as it plans to bring down dependence on the energy 
		sector to a mere 25 per cent, Kamal, who is also Acting Minister of 
		Economy and Commerce, said at the recently held Second Qatar Economic 
		Forum. The Minister remarked that the state was well aware that neither 
		oil nor gas was an infinite resource and no one can tell where prices of 
		these commodities would stand in the next 10 to 15 years. <br>
		<br>
		“Ten years ago, we were in a crisis. External debts were 148 per cent of 
		our GDP. We had to accomplish financial restructuring and economic 
		reform. This was extremely painful and unfortunately, the pain of reform 
		reaches the lower income group. But the pain is also with those who made 
		the decision,” he said. Such ‘painful’ steps included cutting down on 
		recruitment in the government sectors and also decreasing investments 
		out of the state budget.” Since 2003, “Qatar is getting the fruits of 
		the decisions taken in those years,” he stated. <br>
		<br>
		Kamal admitted to some shortcomings which, he said, would be dealt with 
		through various acts of legislation. “There is a gradual openness and we 
		should get the private sector to accept this. There will be 
		liberalisation in certain sectors by 2013. Our financial systems and 
		legal systems are not hand-in-hand with international levels. We are now 
		unifying these and getting legislation ready for global acceptability.”
		<br>
		<br>
		Kamal stated: “We are ready to change laws to meet international 
		standards to attract more investments.’ Qatar, however, now is a serious 
		player overseas when it comes to investments abroad. </font></p>

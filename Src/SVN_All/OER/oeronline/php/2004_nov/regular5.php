            The rather garish book cover might put the more serious reader off 
            this book, however you really should put that aside as the content 
            within is definitely worth reading. Time is also something that you 
            will need for this 350-page book. I was glad it was a paperback 
            rather than hardbound or lifting it would have been a problem! This 
            book is actually the third in the series and although I cannot 
            comment on the colour, size, weight or content of the earlier books, 
            after reading this one I shall certainly be searching for the 
            others. <br>
            <br>
            The entire book is very well structured and takes you through the 
            process of brand leadership without getting too technical and uses a 
            language that can be understood by laymen and guru’s alike. I 
            particularly liked the use of known brands as examples to convey the 
            chapter content across to the reader. One other impressive item 
            about this book is the “discussion points” at the end of each 
            chapter. A lot of these books try to get the reader to perform 
            “exercises” that test knowledge and absorption of the chapter 
            content, whereas I found the discussion points a lot more relevant 
            and challenging and it did get me thinking about the brands that I 
            represent and how they fit into the market in Oman.<br>
            <br>
            The relevance to the market here in Oman is key as long as you read 
            it in the right
            <img border="0" src="im111d.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="124">manner. 
            A lot of companies here deal with multiple brands as the distributor 
            rather than as brand owners and therefore the chapter that discusses 
            about the “house of brands” vs the “branded house” is something that 
            all marketing managers in local companies would be well advised to 
            read. Overall this is a book I will refer to over the coming months 
            and the chapter on “sponsoring as a brand benefit” will change the 
            way Oman United Agencies will manage its brands in 2005.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">“Change is 
            inevitable” – and Maverick embodies how change can be managed in the 
            most efficient and successful manner. It illustrates that age-old 
            traditional methods of doing business do not necessarily have to be 
            the norm. By experimenting and innovating, one can come up with very 
            effective, long-lasting and highly rewarding solutions.<br>
            <br>
            Maverick challenges all existing systems and methods of modern day 
            organisational structures. It makes very engrossing reading as one 
            actually sees a traditional workplace transform into a company that 
            not only makes money but also contributes immeasurably towards 
            improving the lives of people working for it. Ricardo Semler unveils 
            that he is a true maverick and the success that SEMCO has had by 
            applying unorthodox styles makes one wonder why more companies do 
            not take this bold stance and emulate this highly successful 
            approach.<br>
            <br>
            The strength of a successful business is in its people and Semco, 
            one of the fastest growing companies in Latin America recognises 
            that. Where has one heard of complete workers empowerment - where 
            employees can fix their time of work, where they can choose to work 
            from home, where they have a say in setting their own salaries, 
            where they are involved in evaluating and even hiring their 
            superiors. Ricardo Semler throws the
            <img border="0" src="im111c.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="100" height="124">rulebook 
            completely out of the window. However, there seems to be a method to 
            this madness. <br>
            <br>
            Maverick leads you to believe that participative management is here 
            to stay. A company should trust its destiny to its employees. <br>
            <br>
            Inspiring, Invigorating and a must-read for all those who aspire to 
            be real life mavericks!<br>

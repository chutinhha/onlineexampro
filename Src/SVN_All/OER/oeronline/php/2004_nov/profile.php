<b>as he is fondly referred to, once marched for the Sultan’s Armed forces,

to apply for a licence to ride his first bicycle. Saubhagya Mohan Kala meets 
Maqbool Hameed Al-Saleh, the chairman of Oman Holdings International (OHI)</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="profile.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="150" height="190">Born 
in Muttrah, life was not a bed of roses for Maqbool Hameed Al-Saleh. ‘‘My 
ancestors had reversed the proverbial rise into a fall, and had taken the family 
fortunes from riches to rags! We were quite poor, and my father had to work in 
public transport just to make the ends meet,’’ he remembers.<br>
<br>
It isn’t surprising, then, that Al- Saleh was not able to get even high-school 
education and found himself in the Sultan’s Armed forces in 1959. Totally at sea 
with English, Maqbool Hameed self-taught himself the language by reading the 
newspapers discarded by the British officers. ‘‘I would have been sent home 
after the first month were it not for the kindness of Sgt. Siddiqui, who got me 
posted in the orderlies’ room, where I could survive,’’ he recalls.<br>
<br>
Having graduated from what he calls ‘‘The School of Hard Knocks,’’ Al- Saleh 
ensured that his siblings and his children do not lose out on the opportunity to 
get quality education. His first son, a graduate from the UK, has joined him in 
the family business. The second son has recently graduated from George 
Washington University in the US and works for HSBC. His youngest daughter has 
joined one of the best universities at Bristol in England after having finished 
her schooling from the Sultan School in Oman.<br>
<br>
<b>Young challenge</b><br>
Maqbool Hameed Al Saleh recounts an intriguing challenge that he faced as a 
youth. This was when the Army was headquartered in Bait Al Falaj. With no public 
transport or personal vehicle at his disposal, Maqbool Hameed had to walk a 
great distance in peak summer. With lack of proper roads, he also had to climb a 
hill to cross Darsait! <br>
<br>
Eventually, tired with this daily trudge, Maqbool Hameed told his father that he 
wanted to buy a cycle. ‘‘I found a second-hand one for just Rs 25 (210 baisa). 
He seemed apprehensive and said that I would need a licence. And incredible as 
it may sound, I did get a cycle licence for my little cycle! To the affluent 
youth of today, this may seem farcical, but it was a big challenge for me to get 
my first cycle.’’</font></p>

                          “My chief leisure activity is reading, though when I 
                          was younger, I also had to find time to get through a 
                          few sets of strenuous squash. But ever since I damaged 
                          my Achilles’ tendon, reading consumes all my spare 
                          time. My first choice would be autobiographies of 
                          successful people. For example, I was recently reading 
                          Jack Welch writing about his life and management style 
                          in Jack: Straight from the Gut. I also read fiction, 
                          being particularly fond of Jeffrey Archer, whose 
                          inventiveness and story-telling ability I find quite 
                          appealing. I have read most of his works and wait for 
                          new books from him.”</font></td>

</div>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<b>Career Graph</b><br>
While the army was his first paying job, Maqbool Hameed believes that his 
‘career’ started with the auditing firm Ernst &amp; Young (then Whinney Murray) in 
Dubai. ‘‘The job was one of adding numbers in the telephone directory. I did 
that for some time – having no clue about what I was doing. And thought they 
were mad to pay me Dhs800 for this!’’ he exclaims. <br>
<br>
Totally perplexed with his work profile, Maqbool Hameed to his consternation was 
given a raise, furnished accommodation and transferred to Abu Dhabi! In this 
confused state of mind, he went up to his boss, Trevor Potter, and said that he 
wanted to quit. “He couldn’t fathom why a person who was doing so well wanted to 
leave,” reminisces Al- Saleh. It was only when his boss commented that he was 
‘auditing well’ that Maqbool Hameed realised that ‘‘I was actually auditing, and 
was doing a good job of it too.’’<br>
<br>
Like the prodigal son, Maqbool Hameed returned to Oman when His Majesty Sultan 
Qaboos bin Said assumed power. Making the most of the tiny savings that Maqbool 
Hameed had left over from his Whinney Murray days, he started a small business. 
‘‘I brought a truckload of Pepsi Cola from Dubai and introduced it in Oman. 
Soon, I added more trucks. The rest, as they say, is history.’’ And what a 
history it has been. From its humble beginnings, the OHI Group has today grown 
into a RO35.24 million business monolith, and featured as No. 9 on this year’s 
The OER 20, the annual ranking of the largest listed companies in Oman. “We have 
slowly walked together and got to where we are today. We have not zoomed or 
whizzed to get here, we have walked and climbed: a long walk it was,” says a 
visibly content Maqbool Hameed.<br>
<br>
The OHI group owes its success to diversification, and Maqbool Hameed firmly 
believes that one has to be always on the lookout for opportunities in new 
areas. Always examining options and potential business avenues, Maqbool Hameed 
says, “I do not believe in putting all eggs in one basket, and that is perhaps 
why OHI is so stable today. A decline in one business is offset by a climb 
elsewhere and so on. We always look for ways of adding value and utilising 
resources for growth. This also provides direct benefits to the country, since 
it would provide job opportunities for young Omanis in line with His Majesty’s 
vision and recent directive and earn valuable foreign exchange.’’<br>
<br>
Around the same time he started his Pepsi distribution business, Maqbool Hameed 
met up with two of his acquaintances from the army days, an Omani and an 
Englishman, who asked him to join as a secretary in the Ministry of Diwan. Al 
Saleh agreed, and eventually rose to the position of an undersecretary. “Those 
were probably some of the happiest days of my life. I got an opportunity to get 
close to His Majesty and experience at first-hand his kindness and generosity,’’ 
he says with a beaming face.<br>
<br>
<b>Management Mores</b><br>
Maqbool Hameed Maqbool Hameed’s management philosophy is as practical as his 
approach to life: “Do not go in for showy labels or complex concepts – be 
direct, simple and straightforward, and approach all problems with a spirit of 
cooperation and consensus.’’ This approach applies to all his partners, 
colleagues, employees and clients. <br>
Living by the credo, ‘‘Teamwork, first and foremost,’’ OHI’s strength, according 
to Maqbool Hameed, lies in its people. He remains hands-on when it comes to 
picking and judging the individuals he wants to work with him. ‘‘Once I get the 
right person, I leave him to get on with the job. After all, he has been 
selected for his ability to deliver the goods,’’ he insists.<br>
<br>
A modest Maqbool Hameed adds almost in the same breath that he is not so 
arrogant as to pretend that all his choices have been correct. “Sometimes, I 
have found that particular managers were not as good as I thought them to be, 
but if you see the number of my senior executives with the years of service in 
OHI, you will agree that my misses have been few and my hits many.’’ And many 
more to go! </font></p>

                          especially the South of France. For decades now, it 
                          has been my preferred choice. I used to have a small 
                          apartment in Cannes, where I went with my family 
                          almost every summer. I like the French people, their 
                          customs and even though I do not speak their language 
                          I sense a natural affinity and get along very well

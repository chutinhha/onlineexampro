                  </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">I completed my M.A. 
            (English) in 1976 with the somewhat vague intention of joining the 
            Indian Foreign Service. However, I accidentally stumbled into the 
            tea industry as a Tea Taster in the same year! After six years, I 
            had tasted enough, and moved on to handle international marketing 
            for a premium group of tea estates. From there, I finally moved to 
            Unilever in India. During my time in international marketing with 
            Unilever, I handled more than 40 markets right across the world, 
            with a diverse range of products, including basmati rice, edible 
            fats, cosmetics, garments, bulk oils, seeds, and even logistics. 
            After a long stint of 12 years at Unilever, I joined Nivea in India, 
            from where I also negotiated a joint venture for the entry of Wella 
            into the country. Thereafter, a challenging offer to steer “the most 
            valuable perfume in the world” lured me to one of my favourite 
            Unilever-era territories – Oman!<br>
            <br>
            <b>What is the management structure at Amouage?</b><br>
            Within the Sabco Group of companies, Amouage functions autonomously. 
            Our owners have the rare wisdom to recruit specialist professionals 
            to run their companies and then leave them alone to work, without 
            constantly looking over their shoulders. I strongly believe this to 
            be a key factor behind the success of Amouage. Structurally, I head 
            our operations worldwide (now in 25 countries and growing fast), 
            including our companies in both Oman and the UK, and report to a 
            non-executive Board of Directors for the Group, comprising the 
            owners as well as professionals.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What does your role in the company entail?</b><br>
            Amouage being a small, tightly run operation, we are all totally 
            hands-on, and everyone can literally do everything, when required. I 
            oversee and direct every aspect of the company’s operations, in 
            Oman, the UK and the US. In each area, such as production, sales, 
            finance and product development, we have specialist managers 
            reporting to me, while marketing is, currently, solely my 
            responsibility. Of all my roles, though, I consider the most 
            important (and the most satisfying) to be to nurture and grow our 
            employees.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How long have you been in Oman, and how different is it from 
            India, your home country?</b><br>
            I am now into my fifth year in Oman, though it still feels like it 
            was yesterday that I arrived! Operations here are not really all 
            that different from India or, indeed, any of the other markets 
            around the world that I have worked in. At the end of the day, it is 
            all about getting the best out of your people, your material 
            resources, and your markets.<br>
            Briefly describe your management style.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps it is best described as ‘nurturing’. I am an ardent believer 
            in being an ‘‘employer of choice,’’ creating a work environment that 
            is not only productive, but also offers a fair degree of employee 
            comfort by making people happy, work enjoyable, and providing 
            genuine care. Our people know that they really do have a choice and 
            are free to leave the company at any time, with all our good wishes, 
            even to join competitors if they so wish – but no one has left! In 
            this, I believe we are a very unusual organisation in the region, 
            and it has definitely stood us in good stead. <br>
            <br>
            We have steadily increased employee benefits and improved our work 
            environment (such as having piped music playing throughout the 
            perfumery, with everyone encouraged to play their own choice of 
            music whenever they wish), to the point where everyone at Amouage 
            really does consider it a tightly knit family and behaves 
            accordingly. For instance, when there is a sudden surge in 
            production demand, everyone chips in and works extra hours – 
            voluntarily, without even being asked. I myself have no hesitation 
            in joining the staff on the shop-floor – though I am probably less 
            effective there than they are. <br>
            <br>
            Then again, every year, people are exchanged between our Oman and UK 
            offices, for orientation, at even junior levels. In the future, we 
            even hope to build a crèche for the pre-school children of our women 
            employees, and further enhance our work environment in other ways.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What are the challenges that your business faces in Oman?</b><br>
            The biggest challenge is maintaining our world-beating quality. 
            Amouage is the only recognised and awarded international prestige 
            fragrance from outside Europe, Japan and the US. The challenge, 
            therefore, is to be on the vigil all the time so that there is never 
            the slightest slip in quality standards. Fortunately, everyone at 
            Amouage is so intensely proud of his or her product that they are, 
            by far, the strictest supervisors of there own work. <br>
            <br>
            Other than that is the perennial problem of convincing suppliers 
            that delivery schedules are not really fine pieces of fiction 
            designed for the entertainment of all. Of course, there is the 
            inherent problem of running an operation right across the world, in 
            terms of time zones and weekend differences. As a result, some of us 
            end up effectively being on-call seven days a week. <br>
            <br>
            Finally, one of the most exhilarating challenges is meshing our 
            multi-national, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic team into a seamless 
            unit. We have people from 10 nationalities working for Amouage, and 
            it is something of a hobby with us to try and increase that number. 
            At the same time, we take Omanisation very seriously (currently, our 
            Omanisation percentage is almost double than that required) and we 
            have specific, stated targets to increase it further.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What were the challenges specific to Amouage that you faced, and 
            how did you overcome these?</b><br>
            We had major problems in many areas—distribution, sales, finance, 
            marketing, product development—and I personally did not do anything 
            at all to overcome them. I am very fortunate to have a team of very 
            talented and committed managers who have performed miracles over the 
            last few years. Rabin has worked wonders on finance and cost 
            engineering; Javed has completely transformed our distributor 
            relationships; Wendy has turned our European operations into the 
            ‘tiger’ of the Company; Vinay has streamlined manufacturing; 
            Margaret is on the verge of big breakthroughs in our US operations. 
            How lucky can a CEO get!<br>
            <br>
            <b>Which management gurus do you favour and why?</b><br>
            My shareholders. If they smile, we are obviously managing right; if 
            they don’t, we aren’t. Of course, Amouage being a sort of national 
            treasure, we are very conscious that we have to keep the smile on 
            the faces of a larger pool of ‘stakeholders’ – the people of Oman, 
            who are so proud of Amouage and who give us such tremendous support. 
            In terms of traditional gurus, I admire Tom Peters. I love his 
            iconoclastic, out-of-the-box, lateral-thinking ideas.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How do you de-stress yourself after a demanding day’s work?</b><br>
            What stress? We have so much fun working for Amouage that there is 
            no stress to worry about!

				<u>The Smart technology at the office place</u> is revolutionising the 
				way people, process and technology integrate. Conference 
				calling, web conferencing, unified messaging, voice mail, replay 
				line, fax-on-demand, virtual office, software solutions are some 
				areas where cutting-edge technology is required to make an 
				office look smart.<br>
				<br>
				Electronic systems used in an office environment are comprised 
				of hardware and software components.When used together, these 
				components are capable of storing, retrieving, manipulating, 
				transferring, computing, and printing information. Hardware 
				components include, but are not limited to, electronic 
				typewriters, word processors, personal computers, work stations 
				(keyboards and visual displays) linked to a computer, and 
				associated equipment such as printers, optical scanners, and 
				modems. Typical types of software used in office automation work 
				include word processing, electronic mail, calendar, project 
				management, database management, desk-top publishing, graphics 
				and spreadsheet.<br>
				<br>
				Nowadays, office interiors are being renovated to accommodate 
				the demands of such communication, keeping aesthetics and space 
				management as top priority. Overhead projectors, plasma screens, 
				surround sound systems, sleek microphones, video cameras and 
				other gizmos find discreet space.<br>
				<br>
				Automation Office automation refers to the varied computer 
				machinery and software used to digitally create, collect, store, 
				manipulate and relay office information needed for accomplishing 
				basic tasks and goals.<br>
				<br>
				Office automation helps in optimising or automating existing 
				office procedures. The backbone of office automation is a Local 
				Area Network (LAN), which allows users to transmit data, mail 
				and even voice across the network. All office functions, 
				including dictation, typing, filing, copying, fax, telex, 
				microfilm and records management, telephone and telephone 
				switchboard operations, fall into this category. Office 
				automation was a popular term in the 1970s and 1980s as the 
				desktop computer exploded onto the scene.<br>
				<br>
				A universal truth is dawning on the multinational brand names 
				the world over that brands are incidental and the solution is 
				the driver.<br>
				<br>
				Decision makers today treat information technology (IT) as their 
				basic need for any business. Recovery cost depends on the 
				customer. The earlier the customer decides to put implement IT 
				solutions, the faster the returns. Spiralling costs can be 
				handled in many ways. And one of them is to optimise on the 
				functions of the gadgets like printers, fax machines, printers, 
				notebooks and laptops, scanners etc.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Staying connected</b><br>
				<br>
				It has been found that when employers give employees an 
				environment they feel comfortable and good in, they become more 
				productive and satisfied in the workplace. Staying connected is 
				also critical in a company’s ability to respond to a customer’s 
				changing needs, with the latest technology to work around. The 
				Smart Office equipments now come in portable sizes too, so that 
				the user may even cart it along to another part of the continent 
				– and never have to miss out on an important meeting.<br>
				<br>
				Researchers who studied teams of software programmers working on 
				a project and huddled in one room for four months revealed that 
				they (software developers) spent less than half their time at 
				tasks like programming and coding; the remainder of their day 
				was spent on meetings, problem resolution with team members or 
				clients, product testing, etc.<br>
				<br>
				Isolated in cubicles, communication between programmers was 
				impaired; researchers found that the further apart team members 
				were, the less they talked to each other. The net effect of 
				ineffective communication was that projects habitually came in 
				overtime and exceeded their budgets.<br>
				<br>
				This research confirmed the positive effect of locating 
				employees in a more flexible, open space. Time-to-market, or 
				cycle time for the software programmes developed by the teams 
				dropped by one-third as compared to a company baseline. 
				Communication and problem resolution were enhanced by close 
				proximity to others on the team. Once upon a time, every 
				employee was housed in a cubicle or individual office. These 
				days, there are fewer permanent addresses; not every employee 
				needs a personal work station in a digital workplace.<br>
				<br>
				The average office space used to be 70 per cent cubicles and 30 
				per cent collaborative or shared space. Today, that equation is 
				55 per cent cubicles and 45 per cent shared space. In the agile 
				office, a hybrid solution often works best: small private rooms 
				for concentrated work, personal work stations in open office 
				settings for team work, and a variety of formal and informal 
				meeting spaces. Work spaces are simultaneously shrinking: from a 
				standard unit of 8 by 10 feet to one as small as 6 by 6 feet in 
				an open office plan. Work station walls are coming down, to open 
				up views and allow occupants to enjoy natural light.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Healthy workplace</b><br>
				<br>
				Further, as health and safety of employees becomes paramount for 
				companies, most corporate offices are switching to ergonomic and 
				functional furniture. These areas are designed to break the 
				monotony of workplaces and create a healthy working atmosphere 
				where employees feel relaxed. The trend is to create a friendly 
				ambience for both management and employees like a community, 
				where everyone is familiar with another, a place where all needs 
				are met, physical as well as psychological.<br>
				<br>
				Therefore a smart office will strive to create an environment 
				that has a smart, attractive, friendly design and can form an 
				office ambience which is flexible, effective and welcoming for 
				employees, which makes them feel like coming to work, and 
				motivates them to increase productivity. Creating a non- or 
				low-toxic workplace would be a plus point for a smart office. 
				For example: Use low-VOC paints along with 100 per cent virgin 
				wool carpets made without chemicals or dyes (wool carpet lasts 
				much longer than does synthetic carpet, so the carpeting will 
				not need to be replaced as quickly)<br>
				<br>
				Natural carpet padding (made of jute fibres encased in recycled 
				paper) when tacked to the floor help avoid the chemical 
				offgassing that would have occurred had they been glued. Several 
				practical steps can help you to create a healthier workplace. 
				The key to a healthier office is prevention – in other words, 
				use healthy and efficient building, lighting, and HVAC design, 
				and use nontoxic building materials, furnishings, and office 
				supplies.<br>
				<br>
				The best way to create a green and healthy environment is to 
				begin by carrying out an environmental audit to study the duct 
				system, building and lighting design, and office furnishings and 
				to survey employees. The company can create corporate policies 
				that encourage healthier purchasing decisions and production 
				methods and support employee health.<br>

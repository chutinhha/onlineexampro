					life when he studied psychology at Stanford University. In 
					fact, he proved so good that he qualified for the 
					university’s golf team. After his graduation, he turned 
					professional in 1971.<br>
					<br>
					In the early years of his career, Watson seemed to lose his 
					nerve when it became possible for him to actually win a 
					tournament. Whether true or not, the media played on it and 
					earned Watson an ‘also ran’ reputation. Bryon Nelson 
					approached Watson after a tournament and offered his 
					assistance. <br>
					<br>
					Watson began working with Byron Nelson, who would become a 
					great friend and mentor, and in 1974 broke through with his 
					first PGA Tour victory. In 1975, he won the Byron Nelson 
					Classic, then his first British Open title. Watson was off 
					and running.<br>
					<br>
					Watson won the first of his five Open titles in 1975. His 
					dedication to the Open earned him enormous respect in the 
					United Kingdom especially as so many Americans see world 
					golf as beginning and ending on the US shoreline. By 1977, 
					the years he won his first US Masters, Watson became leading 
					money winner and the greatest challenge to Jack Nicklaus. In 
					the period of time between Jack Nicklaus’ peak and Tiger 
					Woods’ peak, Watson was head-and-shoulders above any other 
					golfer in the world.<br>
					<br>
					Watson stood up to Nicklaus on numerous occasions, one of 
					the few golfers who consistently went toe-to-toe with 
					Nicklaus and came out on top. Their duel at the 1977 British 
					Open – where Nicklaus shot 66-66 over the final two rounds, 
					while Watson shot 66-65 to win by one - is one of the 
					greatest head-to-head battles the sport has ever seen. 
					Watson robbed Nicklaus of another major at the 1982 U.S. 
					Open with his famous chip-in on the 17th hole at Pebble 
					Beach.<br>
					<br>
					These were golden years for Watson. He was five times 
					leading money winner, six times US PGA Player of the Year. 
					He won the US Open in 1983. He was awarded the Vardon trophy 
					three times and in 1986 was awarded the Bobby Jones Award. 
					However the US PGA always elud</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ed 
					with a second place his best finish. Watson had a genuine 
					affinity for the sporting element of golf and although 
					financially successful, he did not always chase the buck. 
					Tom Watson was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 
					1988.<br>
					<br>
					Watson retired in 1991 and his magnificent victories earned 
					through perseverance and determination, set an example. In 
					1999, Tom Watson was made an honorary member of the Royal &amp; 
					Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. He joined four other 
					Americans to receive that honour: Arnold Palmer, Jack 
					Nicklaus, President George H.W. Bush and Gene Sarazen.<br>
					<br>
					While he has perhaps not earned the popularity that he 
					deserves, his place in golf’s history is assured.</font></p>

					research, and publishing company specialising in economic 
					country intelligence, brings out a yearly edition featuring 
					a review of the political and economic developments in the 
					Sultanate. The publication has been one of the key providers 
					of targeted information, analysis and advice to the global 
					business community with regards to investment and business 
					potential.<br>
					<br>
					OBG’s forthcoming 250-page publication, <u>‘The Report: Oman 
					2011’</u>, will provide a review of the key economic sectors 
					with comprehensive information and analysis with regards to 
					investment and business potential in Oman.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How long has OBG been in Oman and how has it performed?</b><br>
					<br>
					OBG has been on the ground for seven years and in this 
					period has developed a very strong relationship with the 
					local business community. The recent memorandum of 
					understanding signed with Brand Oman Management Unit (BOMU) 
					is a testimony to this and recognition of how ‘The Report’ 
					has become a significant resource not only within Oman but 
					further afield.<br>
					<br>
					Additionally our ongoing relationship with our partners Al 
					Busaidy, Mansoor Jamal &amp; Co; and Abu Timam Grant Thornton 
					allows us to provide specific technical advice to our 
					readership. This, coupled with the very strong pool of 
					research sources we have developed over the past seven years 
					is the bedrock of our publication. Indeed, as a ground 
					approach, working with respected partners is one of <br>
					our hallmarks.<br>
					<br>
					We have consistently secured contributions to our Oman 
					publications from His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said; Ahmed 
					bin Abdulnabi Macki, Minister of National Economy; and 
					Sayyid Fahad bin Mahmood Al Said, Oman’s Deputy Prime 
					Minister, to name a few.<br>
					<br>
					<b>What have been the major sectors that have been covered 
					by OBG in Oman so far. Do you plan to cover any new sectors 
					for this year?</b><br>
					<br>
					OBG publications follow a format that our readers have come 
					to know and expect. We provide 250-300 pages of in depth 
					analysis of all the most pertinent sectors of an economy – 
					from a macro-economic and political overview at the 
					beginning to chapter-by-chapter break down of all industries 
					including energy, industry, banking, insurance and tourism.
					<br>
&nbsp;</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr"> 
                    <font face="Verdana" size="1">In addition to this standard 
					format, we often include chapters which are unique to the 
					country in question. So in Oman we have a regions chapter 
					which particularly focuses on the opportunities and 
					development in Salalah, Sohar and Duqm. As Sohar and Duqm 
					continue to grow there may well come a time when we have 
					specific chapters for each of the regions. Additionally this 
					year, we have added a new chapter on culture, youth, and 
					sports with the assistance of BOMU.<br>
					<br>
					<b>What is the mechanism of information gathering apart from 
					interviews?</b><br>
					<br>
					OBG’s ‘The Report’ draws opinions and thoughts from leading 
					contemporary and influential personalities, both from the 
					government and the private sector, conducting first hand, on 
					the ground research on Oman. The information from interviews 
					makes up the majority of our content. This includes 
					interviewing opinion makers, business leaders and high level 
					governmental decision makers, using their expertise and 
					experience to put together a comprehensive economic guide. 
					To supplement this, we work closely with research partners 
					and access existing data.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How do you overcome the clear and present danger of using 
					outdated data and information in the OBG report?</b> <br>
					<br>
					Indeed, this is a challenge that all of us in the business 
					of information provision deal with, not only in Oman, but 
					much of the rest of the region too. The issue of accurate 
					and up-to-date statistical information is one that is widely 
					debated. We seek to overcome this by coming back annually 
					and having a team on the ground for 6-8 months. We also draw 
					on a lot of material, which we always source and try to 
					ensure it is the most updated available. When we have no 
					choice but to use material that is 12-18 months old, we make 
					it very clear that at the time of printing it was the most 
					recent available. It is pleasing that over the past few 
					years we have seen some very positive improvements in Oman 
					on this front.<br>
					<br>
					<b>What does OBG mean to Omani businessmen and investors?</b><br>
					<br>
					‘The Report: Oman 2011’ will be, as the previous editions 
					have been, a comprehensive and accurate analysis of 
					political, macroeconomic and sectoral developments in Oman, 
					including banking, construction, insurance, capital markets, 
					energy, infrastructure, industry and real estate. Omani 
					businessmen and investors can draw their own conclusions and 
					identify opportunities from the information provided. In 
					addition, ‘The Report’ can be a valuable tool for 
					businessmen to share information about the country with 
					potential partners and investors too, should they wish. It 
					provides information on all major sectors of the economy but 
					also a series of signposts pointing to investment 
					opportunities.<br>
					<br>
					<b>What is the methodology of your circulation and does OBG 
					reach your target audience?</b><br>
					<br>
					‘The Report: Oman 2011’ will be available in print and 
					online version and is available directly from OBG and not in 
					bookstores. Many of our clients buy ‘The Report’ in bulk to 
					distribute to their own customers and investors. The target 
					audience of Oxford Business Group’s Reports is potential 
					investors to a region and judging from the amount of reports 
					purchased by government entities to provide to potential 
					investors, it would appear that they are successful in doing 
					so.<br>
					<br>
					‘The Report’ is complemented by OBG’s online economic 
					briefings that provide regular in-depth market analysis on 
					Oman and will be made available to our corporate subscribers 
					worldwide.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

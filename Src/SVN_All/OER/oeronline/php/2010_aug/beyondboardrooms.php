					give up in life, if you stop it is like going back in life. 
					Once you start anything you should go on till you reach your 
					goal,” says Wasila. And there could hardly be a better 
					proponent of this credo than Wasila herself. Having started 
					her career as a public relations officer at Sahel 
					Enterprises at the age of 18 she has risen to the top 
					echelons of the corporate sector. After working at Sahel for 
					two years she joined OHI as a secretary and a receptionist. 
					Despite having a job she continued to pursue her education 
					simultaneously and moved to the accounts department in OHI 
					within two years in an internal shift. When OHI listed on 
					the Muscat Securities Market (MSM), a department was created 
					to liaison with the stock market and she took charge of it. 
					As the company grew the need was felt for an assistant to 
					the legal advisor and the responsibility fell on her 
					shoulders.<br>
					<br>
					“There were times when people used to ask me – so where have 
					you done your college from and I would feel really ashamed 
					as I had merely finished secondary school at that time.” But 
					since then there has been no looking back – a Bachelors 
					degree in Law from Beirut College in Lebanon in 2006, helped 
					her to become a junior group legal advisor at OHI. In 
					January 2009 she left OHI and joined the Al Sulaimi Group as 
					their group legal advisor. She says, “I like challenges and 
					believe that one should build one’s future from nothing as 
					that gives you the satisfaction of having done things on 
					your own.”<br>
					<br>
					</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Time management</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Time management has helped this mother of five to juggle her 
					responsibilities at home and at work. Apart from these she 
					also finds time for painting, writing poetry and writing 
					columns in periodicals. Wasila has also managed to pursue 
					her education simultaneously. After her graduation she did 
					her Masters in Law from the Arab Academy for Sciences and 
					Technology in Egypt. She is currently pursuing a PhD in Law 
					from Al Manar University of Tunisia. <br>
					<br>
					Talking about time management she says, “It is important to 
					arrange ones time in the right way, one should 
					compartmentalise time between one’s family, work and studies 
					and never mix them. She has also used novel ways to utilise 
					her time like using the waiting time at a petrol station to 
					catch up with her reading. A firm believer in the fact that 
					there is no difference between men and women she says, “if 
					you are strong and want to get something, you have to work 
					hard and get what you want.” She is grateful for the support 
					that she has got from her husband and children. My children 
					come to me and ask me “Why are you not studying and 
					encourage me to do better,” she says in jest. Wasila is 
					indeed a role model for others to look upto.<br>

					<b><br>
                    </b>It is only when the tide goes away, that you know who is 
					swimming naked,” is a proverb that has been often quoted by 
					captains of industry in the last few years. And, perhaps 
					rightly so, as the tide of the last couple of years, has 
					seen behemoths collapse, companies being taken over, bailed 
					out, or simply restructured. Such has been the global 
					debacle after the Lehman Brothers collapse, that when the 
					economy history of the 21st century is written it would be 
					well segregated as pre and post Lehmann eras. <br>
					<br>
					Of course, during the heydays, many sins were hidden, that 
					have now come to light. Over exposure, bonus excesses, 
					exorbitant salaries etc., were some of the cardinal sins 
					that are not pardonable anymore. <br>
					<br>
					In all the economic mayhem, what may have come to the fore, 
					are leaderships that have managed to tide over the crisis, 
					and successfully weather the storm. So why has effective 
					corporate leadership assumed such significance in the last 
					few years? It is simply because corporate captains have had 
					to deal with crisis in several areas, at one go. Crisis of 
					consumer confidence, sagging employee morale, demanding 
					customers, tough bankers et al. The recession or the global 
					economic downturn, as the case maybe, has separated the good 
					leaders from the mediocre ones. Effective leaders may have 
					been the ones that were able to motivate employees; ensure 
					nimble-footedness; remain astute while negotiating with 
					bankers; and last but not the least ones that were able to 
					boost demand. In fact, the present recession has bought 
					about the best in some leaders, who were able to deliver 
					extraordinary reactions to a crisis. In Oman, it was a case 
					of business downturn, more thawn a recession. The Oman 
					Economic Review spoke to several corporate chieftains here 
					in Oman on the role of a leader and how they managed to 
					overcome the crisis. We got some thought provoking and 
					interesting insight into how some of them responded to the 
					crisis. <br>
					<br>
					Take for example the case of boosting employee morale. Ali 
					Mohammed Juma, Chief Executive of Vision Investment Services 
					SAOC, dealt with employee morale by ensuring transparency 
					with employees on the company’s performance, creating a fun 
					environment, and helping employees focus on opportunities 
					that had arisen because of the crisis. At the Al Sulaimi 
					Group, it was a contrarian call of hiring. “During the 
					crisis, employees all around the world were concerned about 
					job security. At the Al-Sulaimi Group we assured all our 
					employees that we won’t lay off anyone and we explained to 
					them the reasons for the decision. In fact, we went about 
					hiring people, as quality talent was available,” says 
					Haitham Al Fannah, COO of the Al Sulaimi Group. <br>
					<br>
					These are just a few examples of corporate czars managing 
					the crisis. We got examples where visionary leadership, 
					astute business acumen paid rich dividends in boosting 
					demand, employee morale and overall business conditions. <br>
					<br>
					Clearly, the crisis had found effective leaders, who were 
					separated from the ordinary ones; just like wheat is 
					separated from the chaff.</font></td>

					are the essential qualities of a leader that come to the 
					fore during a crisis like the global financial crisis?<br>
					<br>
					</b>Never Panic. Immediately plan actions that need to be 
					taken for survival of the organisation. Ensure that you 
					collect all outstandings, even if you have to make certain 
					concessions. Open-up all avenues to dilute your stocks and 
					have a management meeting with the work-force, to explore 
					all avenues of cost cutting that do not lead to more damages 
					in the future. Essential capital goods expenditure can’t be 
					just put on abeyance. These choices are of prime importance 
					during a crisis.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Is it right to say that leaders are catalysts and 
					facilitators who make effective use of talents and resources 
					during a crisis?<br>
					<br>
					</b>Yes, but they can’t do it alone. They have to build-up 
					confidence in the management and the work-force with 
					positive action and seek their assisstance in the goal and 
					objectives set out to tide over the crisis.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How did you manage your manpower effectively without 
					hurting employee morale during the past two years?<br>
					<br>
					</b>A joint decision with the management and work-force was 
					taken for a salary cut and all incentive schemes temporarily 
					suspended. Furthermore, other steps included a judicious use 
					of overtime work and reduction of contract labourers to a 
					minimum. <br>
					<br>
					<b>How should a leader manage customer expectations during a 
					crisis as everything seems to be unknown and fuzzy?<br>
					<br>
					</b>We definitely need to support our customers and must 
					also understand that they are in the same shoes as us. 
					Therefore, we gave some concessions on prices and also 
					extended the time for outstanding repayments. We can now 
					boast that despite all these facilities provided to our 
					customers, we did not have a single bad debt during the 
					crisis and till date.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How did you manage customer, employee and shareholders 
					expectations at Al Jazeera Steel in 2009?<br>
					<br>
					</b>I must appreciate the full support that I got from all 
					concerned, namely: customer, employee and shareholders. 
					Everyone understood the gravity of the situation and 
					supported the management in full. It was difficult to 
					convince banks to lend during this period. The board took 
					personal pains to approach bank, who having the goodwill for 
					Jazeera Steel also supported us with rescheduling of loans. 
					We are proud to say that we met all the committments with 
					the bank before the promised dates. </font></td>

					attributes of a leader have come to light, due to the global 
					financial crisis?<br>
					<br>
					</b>The financial crisis was not something that anyone 
					anticipated; that’s precisely why leadership qualities 
					played a major role in the survival of organisations, during 
					turbulent times. We have seen large corporate behemoths 
					collapsing during the financial crisis and of course that 
					can be attributed to many factors. I believe the most 
					important quality a leader should have is his vision; a good 
					vision that will determine how you tackle a crises. It is 
					always easy to say let’s cut cost and lay off employees but 
					what are the consequences of that? You might end up losing 
					good employees that contributed a lot to the organisation 
					during the good times and would have contributed more in the 
					future. Any organisation’s strength lies in its employees 
					and once you start laying-off employees, a crisis could 
					precipitate.<br>
					<br>
					Therefore, a good leader should be a visionary, who has the 
					passion to apply his vision and steer the company forward. 
					Leadership qualities are best known and best used during 
					tough times, and as the saying goes “tough times requires 
					tough decisions.” <br>
					<br>
					<b>Does a good leader make effective use of talents and 
					resources?<br>
					<br>
					</b>Most certainly. Leaders are catalysts and facilitators 
					who make effective use of talents and resources at all 
					times, not only during a crisis. During a crisis we could 
					say that a leader can effectively maintain good productivity 
					as supply is more than the demand.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How did you manage your manpower effectively without 
					hurting employee morale during the past two years?<br>
					<br>
					</b>This is a very interesting question. At the Al-Sulaimi 
					Group, we did not layoff any employees. When the financial 
					crisis erupted, we had a group board meeting to discuss our 
					strategy for dealing with the financial crises and chalked 
					out plans to tackle the crisis.<br>
					<br>
					After careful analysis of all financial implications, the 
					board took a decision not to layoff, in fact we started 
					hiring. You must be wondering “why hire?” Well, it was the 
					right time to pick and choose as there was abundance of 
					talent. We thought this was an investment for the future, 
					and we now have an immensely talented crop of employees. Our 
					employees have always felt confident and secure and we have 
					always received optimum performance, despite the financial 
					crisis. Now that the markets have recovered, we are very 
					well equipped to handle a bigger share of the market, with a 
					talented pool of employees. <br>
					<br>
					<b>How should a leader manage customer expectations during a 
					crisis as everything seems to be unknown and fuzzy? <br>
					</b><br>
					During the crisis supply was more than the demand, (i.e. 
					buyer’s market) competition was at its peak and customer 
					expectations increased drastically. As you said everything 
					was unknown, it was a time when you had to work with several 
					scenarios (Plan “A” and Plan “B” simply weren’t enough). At 
					the Al-Sulaimi Group our goal has not only been to meet 
					customer’s expectations but rather to exceed it. Therefore, 
					we had a real challenge as expectations were very high. We 
					have been determined to meet and exceed customer 
					expectations and that is something we will not compromise 
					on.<br>
					<b>&nbsp;<br>
					How did you manage customer, employee and shareholders 
					expectations at the Al Sulaimi Group in 2009, which was 
					largely a difficult year?<br>
					<br>
					</b>For us, the customer comes above the rest. Our endeavour 
					has always been to meet customer’s expectations simply by 
					offering them high quality service. At the Al-Sulaimi Group 
					customers are share holders, they are the owners of our 
					business, without them we would not have existed.<br>
					<br>
					For us, employees are the soul of our organisation, and we 
					work like a family. During the crisis, employees all around 
					the world were concerned about job security. At the Al-Sulaimi 
					Group we assured all our employees that we won’t lay off 
					anyone and we explained to them the reasons why we had taken 
					that decision. As for our shareholders, I would like to note 
					that our shareholders believe that a successful business 
					entails a good vision supported by satisfied customers and 
					employees. That’s why by formulating a vision for the 
					future; satisfying our customers and employees we have 
					created a recipe for a successful business, which in turn 
					has met our shareholders’ expectations.</font></td>

				<img border="0" src="images/aug_cover04.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0; " width="130" height="235" align="right"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What 
					are the attributes that a good leader should have during 
					challenging times? <br>
					<br>
					</b>I believe that preparedness is the key and a leader’s 
					role starts way before challenging times hit. In this 
					context I am reminded of the phrase, “If you fail to plan, 
					you plan to fail.” It is the role of the leader to ensure 
					that macro risk related factors are well thought of in 
					advance and contingency plans are formulated. More 
					importantly the leader should proactively inculcate the 
					habit of being vigilant and realistic in all the team 
					members. By setting a blue print in place the leader is 
					well-equipped with the required armour to deal with risks 
					arising from macro events.<br>
					<br>
					As far as the soft issues are concerned; during challenging 
					times employees tend to go into a state of confusion, panic 
					and sometimes even depression. In such circumstances the 
					primary responsibility of a leader is to boost the morale of 
					the employees while channelising their energy towards 
					managing risks and identifying opportunities that may arise 
					therein.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How would an effective leader manage employees during a 
					crisis?<br>
					<br>
					</b>Communication is the mantra during challenging times. 
					One cannot over emphasise the importance of being close to 
					the team and keeping an open and interactive channel of 
					communication with the employees. A leader must be 
					transparent about the challenges the company is facing and 
					should promote a participative environment. This will 
					enhance the sense of ownership in the employees and as a 
					result retain talented people who will work efficiently and 
					effectively during such times.<br>
					<br>
					On a personal note, I strongly believe that nothing works 
					better than creating an ambiance of fun; and during 
					challenging times it becomes even more important that the 
					leader lead by example. He should maintain an upbeat 
					attitude with frequent sessions of fun and laughter.<br>
					<br>
					That brings forth one of the most important challenges a 
					leader faces during such times: managing oneself. If the 
					leader fails to properly manage his state of mind and have 
					clarity of direction in which he wants to lead the 
					organisation; it will obviously limit his ability to lead 
					and may have a negative impact on the company.<br>
					<b><br>
					What about seizing opportunities that may come during lean 
					times?<br>
					<br>
					</b>This is a very interesting question. Usually during 
					challenging times organisations are busy managing the 
					consequences and ramifications or exercising a ‘wait and 
					see’ approach. However, I believe a good leader must have 
					the ability to distance himself and have a birds’ eye view 
					of the whole situation to identify and seize opportunities.<br>
					<br>
					For example, during the current global financial crises, we 
					launched our 3rd Fund, Vision Real Economy GCC Fund. 
					Initially we were reluctant and it required strong 
					conviction to swim against the tide. This is where while 
					building our team and company, the preparations we had taken 
					to keep focus and spirit during tough times, held us in good 
					stead and resulted in a very successful launch.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How does a good leader manage customer expectation during 
					times of crisis? <br>
					<br>
					</b>In our industry managing customer expectation is one of 
					the real challenges. We are an investment company and here 
					it’s all about customer’s money. As I often mention “For 
					human beings ‘Money Matters’ matter the most”.On a serious 
					note, the leader has to ensure that there is no lax in the 
					services provided. It is his responsibility to reinforce the 
					need to add value to the customers to manage their risk and 
					be sympathetic.<br>
					<br>
					As far as our industry is concerned, we operate in a highly 
					regulated structure and therefore, there is little scope for 
					us to adjust on the pricing front. Professional ethics and 
					excellence in service are the two binding factors that help 
					retain customers. We capitalised on the current financial 
					crisis by utilising this time to build on our customer base. 
					Our service model, research information, and infrastructure

					</b>Hardly anyone would think that a one and a half litre 
					water bottle would contribute to a 60 per cent reduction in 
					expenses. But that was what the Omzest group of companies 
					was able to achieve – merely by replacing the half litre 
					water bottle with a one and a half litre one. What’s more, 
					this gem of an idea came, not from a top management 
					executive, but from the lower rungs of the organisation when 
					the management invited all its employees to share ideas 
					during the turbulent times of the past year.<br>
					<br>
					“Most of the ideas which are needed to steer a company 
					during a crisis come from within the organisation and a 
					resourceful leadership should be able to create 
					brainstorming sessions to look for inputs from different 
					people at different levels,” says KS Cheema, executive 
					director (Legal &amp; Projects) of Omzest. “A leader has to be 
					resourceful at all times but this ability comes into focus 
					during a crisis,” he adds.<br>
					“Sometimes you tend to ignore important inputs just because 
					the person is not at the right position. So I think you need 
					to be open while communicating with your employees, your 
					customers, as well as with your peers and get whatever best 
					ideas you can. Getting an idea is one part but putting it to 
					use is the more important part of it,” Cheema says.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Focus areas</b><br>
					<br>
					Basically having open communication which motivates your 
					employees and adopting changes in management policy like in 
					terms of newer ways of doing business and addressing changes 
					which take place at a global level are areas which leaders 
					of organisations need to focus on.<br>
					<br>
					According to Cheema, some of the biggest concerns 
					confronting businesses are the reduced demand for products, 
					pressure on prices, longer sales cycles and uncertainty over 
					raw material prices, longer receivables and cash conversion 
					cycles and lower employee morale and job security. In order 
					to address these concerns, an organisation needs to focus on 
					developing new markets, on cost competitiveness, on higher 
					employee productivity, speeder inventory management and on 
					collection and receivables management.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Talent management</b><br>
					<br>
					It is said that leaders are facilitators and catalysts who 
					make effective use of talent during a crisis. In this 
					regard, managing human resources without affecting their 
					morale becomes critical. As a highly diversifiedgroup with 
					companies in various sectors like manufacturing and 
					automobiles, Omzest also had its ups and downs.<br>
					<br>
					“In such a scenario, organisational restructuring is often a 
					very painful exercise when non-value adding processes and 
					sometimes personnel associated with those activities come 
					under the axe. We were very sensitive to this. We did cut 
					off some of the activities which were not value additions 
					but fortunately did not cut off our employees who are our 
					most important resources. And even when we had to change 
					people from one profile to another we ensured that they had 
					the right activity within the organisation and that kept 
					both the organisation’s and employees’ morale up,” explains 
					Cheema.<br>
					<br>
					“Once you take care of your employee morale, they almost vow 
					to pay back in some form or other and that clearly boosts 
					the organisation,” he added.The group also made effective 
					use of lean management theories which, however, did not mean 
					retrenchment but utilisation of same people in multiple 
					activities. So if an employee was contributing only three 
					hours to a particular activity, the company tried to 
					understand where his balance six or seven hours could be 
					utilised. This helped to reduce costs. <br>
					<br>
					“Earlier we used to have a separate receptionist and 
					telephone operator. We realised that both of them were not 
					only sitting idle but wasting each other’s time. Now we have 
					moved one of them to another department and we have realised 
					that both have become more productive and one of them can 
					multi-task. So it is as simple as looking for such ideas,” 
					Cheema stated.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Crisis of sentiment</b><br>
					<br>
					Quite often it is negative sentiment that creates a crisis. 
					The best way to deal with this is to have open communication 
					with the people, assure them that as long you do your best, 
					the organisation will look after your needs. That does not 
					mean just paying salaries at the end of the month. In fact, 
					it also means treating employees with honour and respect as 
					before. And once employees are treated in such a way, I 
					think you win them over psychologically and if employees are 
					psychologically with the company, then their productivity 
					goes up four times higher than normal, says Cheema.<br>
					<br>
					He also advises that sometimes when you do tend to lose your 
					temper you should know the art of putting your arm around 
					your employee and treating them like friends and family. 
					Just like for example when you shout at your wife, you kiss 
					and make up.<br>
					Another aspect of an effective communication is to lay the 
					company’s objectives on the table and notify what the 
					company is doing. Says Cheema, “A good leadership quality is 
					in being able to communicate to your team members about your 
					strategies to tackle a crisis and how you intend to steer 
					into the future. So communication and open discussion are 
					the keys to a successful leadership.”<br>
					<br>
					<b>It’s all about money</b><br>
					<br>
					Ultimately, cash management becomes an overriding factor 
					during difficult situations. Manage your cash flows and you 
					will have managed the crisis, declares Cheema. And there are 
					various ways of doing it: Whether by reducing your input 
					costs or whether by increasing your turnover; whether by 
					reducing the cycle of your receivables or whether by 
					incentivising people to move inventories faster (promotion 
					sales). Whichever way, it applies across all sectors.<br>
					<br>
					Giving examples, Cheema says that in the manufacturing 
					sector, companies are now trying to identify sources of 
					cheap raw materials and also scouting for new markets to 
					sell their produced goods in bulk. And then you can also put 
					more people in receivables. If your turnover is one $1mn and 
					you improve your receivables by five days it adds to almost 
					$50,000. Once you take care of these costings, it has a 
					multiple cascading effect. Because, if you reduce your debt 
					costs, your procurement will become cheaper as you are 
					buying in cash and you don’t have to pay interest.<br>
					<br>
					Again, manufacturing companies dependent upon procurement 
					from open markets, must become innovative in procurement 
					procedures and philosophies. Like for instance, breaking 
					long term contracts for listed commodities which were based 
					on certain formulas and going to the open market to buy. 
					Accept the realities, clean your books and move forward. 
					That’s <br>
					the way forward.</font></td>

					What are the essential qualities of a leader that come to 
					the fore during a crisis, like the global financial crisis?<br>
					</b><br>
					What’s important for a leader during difficult times is to 
					have a clear long-term vision for the business. A good 
					leader would know his strength and would need to believe in 
					it. An important attribute of a leader would be to discuss, 
					and get on board participation from all stakeholders 
					including employees and shareholders, even while motivating 
					and opening all communication channels. Communication with 
					shareholders would ensure that transparency is maintained 
					and that they are kept in the loop about all developments – 
					whether adverse or favourable. So clearly, a good leader is 
					one that is able to communicate, motivate and have a clear 
					long term vision about the company.<br>
					<br>
					<b>So, how did you as the Managing Director of Iskan Oman 
					Investment Company lead the company during the precarious 
					times of 2009?<br>
					</b><br>
					We commenced our activities in 2008 and have had a very 
					strong set of shareholders. It was a conscious decision to 
					gradually grow the business and hence our exposure to the 
					real estate sector was minimal. Also, from our core business 
					which has been real estate, we gradually diversified to 
					other areas. As a leader one of the important attributes is 
					to make prudent decisions after taking into confidence 
					stakeholders interests.<br>
					<br>
					<b>In what areas did you actually diversify?</b><br>
					<br>
					We have moved into the education sector, as we believe that 
					we can cater to the growing needs of imparting quality 
					education. We have taken over one school and are planning to 
					expand with more campuses. We have also diversified into the 
					Food and Beverage industry and gradually will consider other 
					services sector like healthcare.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How does a good leader meet customer expectations?</b><br>
					<br>
					A good leader would always ensure timely delivery of the 
					customers’ promises and expectations. For example, for our 
					real estate project at Salalah, the approach we adopted was 
					not to rush into selling theproject. Instead, we have first 
					appointed leading international consultants to design a 
					quality product that is affordable and now we are focusing 
					on project development and construction. The construction on 
					the project site has already commenced, before we begin to 
					sell the project, thus ensuring that we have put in place 
					what it takes to ensure that customers know what they are 
					buying.<br>
					<br>
					We are certain to deliver what we promise and they can see 
					the construction on site before they pledge a single Rial to 
					the project. In short, we are building the trust and 
					confidence of our customers for the very long term and this 
					is what effective leadership means.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Were you compelled to take tough decisions in 2009, say 
					for example salary cuts?</b><br>
					<br>
					As mentioned earlier, Iskan Oman commenced operation only in 
					2008 and began a gradual process of building the 
					organisation. Since then, we have been a nimble footed and a 
					lean company. So obviously, there was no question of cost 
					cutting and other demoralising decisions to take.<br>
					<br>
					<b>A good leader would make use of opportunities. Did you 
					see any opportunities that came by in 2009?</b><br>
					<br>
					Bad times always bring with it opportunities. Our Salalah 
					project is once again a good example. With the downturn in 
					the real estate sector, we did not shelve or postpone our 
					project instead we seized the opportunity and took advantage 
					of low construction prices and invested our resources in 
					project development. This will ensure our project is on 
					schedule as planned and we are benefitted by the low prices 
					and the benefits will be shared with our customers with very 
					affordable pricing – a win-win situation for all.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How would you summarise the qualities of a good leader?</b><br>
					<br>
					I believe that there are five measures that a good leader 
					must look into, particularly during times of crisis. The 
					first is to assess the situation and do so with an open 
					mind. The second step would be to work on a worst case 
					scenario; thus preparing staff, shareholders and other 
					partners would be important. The next step would be to look 
					at cash flows and not solely profits. The fourth would be to 
					involve your people in all decision making. And finally, a 
					leader must lead the company to be aggressive and innovative 
					during difficult times, something that we have done here at
					<br>
					Iskan Oman.</font></td>

					How important is it for people to see that the leader has 
					the right vision that they can follow him?</b><br>
					<br>
					I think it is extremely important and the reason for that is 
					because part of my work is like a coach, I have to get my 
					team to understand the vision that we are trying to pursue. 
					I need to communicate with them asking for ideas to develop 
					strategies that will take us to market areas that we wish to 
					compete in and to develop strategies for doing so. As a 
					company we want to differentiate ourselves and get financial 
					returns. If we deploy resources into a certain set of 
					objectives, we need to analyse whether they will meet our 
					shareholder expectations.<br>
					<br>
					The leadership aspect is important as I need to be aware of 
					what my team expects from me. Overall, they want to see 
					behaviour that is passionate, committed, that they feel 
					comfortable, energetic and want to share in. This in turn 
					helps me to shape their behaviour towards the objectives 
					that we have set and then helps us to steer the business 
					using our team skills. What the team expects from me are 
					integrity, good values, honesty so that they can say, “I 
					like this leader and want to be a part of this vision that 
					the team is trying to achieve and want to be involved and 
					committed to making these business strategies a reality.” 
					Leaders should provide leadership that is critical in its 
					sustainability and commitment to achieving goals.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Do leadership styles change according to the exigencies 
					of the situation?</b><br>
					<br>
					Leadership styles do change according to the situation, but 
					it operates at two levels – one, there is a strategic 
					perspective that does not change too much. This is a long 
					term vision about where we want to compete, how we want to 
					run our business and how we behave in our values and these 
					remain constant. But in the short term, it changes quite a 
					lot.<br>
					<br>
					During challenging times, objectives that one may have 
					wanted to reach in a period of time might require an 
					extension. In a crisis the team focuses on core profit 
					streams and core behaviours. The team starts listening to 
					what the market is saying, changed customer expectations and 
					trying to meet those needs. What we noticed during 2009 was 
					that in the first six months of the year, the market was 
					affected emotionally by what was happening globally and 
					regionally (in Dubai) and it made us prudent. The underlying 
					fundamentals of this country, its people, the wise 
					government leadership, the sustained spending on 
					infrastructure projects all meant that there was an 
					underlying business need that would continue. In summary, 
					plans need to be developed for the long term, but tactically 
					some decisions have to change rapidly in the short term.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Did you change your leadership style at OMASCO last year?</b><br>
					<br>
					Yes of course. If you take OMASCO we have a three year 
					development strategy, that is updated annually and for the 
					last eight years the vision has been the same to be the No. 
					1 in customer experience and that has not changed. In a 
					difficult year, it is important to develop strategies to 
					meet this vision. We require the continued deployment of 
					resources, we need to find people that have the right skill 
					set and attitudes to help this business to become great and 
					that continues apace. On the other hand, some of the 
					expenditure that we would have liked to make on new 
					buildings, a bigger network had to be delayed as we wanted 
					to see as to how the market developed. For us the key 
					success factor is keeping the team motivated by providing 
					them an environment of learning and involvement. As a team 
					we can discuss strategies for business continuity and 
					growth. This process is not entirely directed by me as a 
					leader but is based on an involved sharing approach in which 
					everyone has a say. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Does meeting customer expectations become more difficult 
					in a tough year?</b><br>
					<br>
					Yes it does; in a tough year the customer sees opportunity. 
					In Oman, some players offered discounts to get rid of excess 
					stock, and the customer quickly linked value to price. In 
					our opinion, offering a better price is a short term gain. 
					Instead, once we saw the market deteriorating, we tried to 
					match our stock levels to the demand curve and thus 
					protected longer term values such as resale value and an 
					ability to bring in new models. OMASCO has moved away from 
					price to an emotional relationship with the customer that is 
					linked to confidence in the brand, receiving the right 
					advice and protecting the inherent value of the product. We 
					have seen wholesale discounting by some of our competitors 
					which over the ensuing months will significantly destroy the 
					resale value of these vehicles. In fact, it takes away real 
					value from customers and we have kept away from such an 
					approach.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How difficult is it to control inventory as forecasting 
					for vehicles is done in advance? </b><br>
					<br>
					We look at a yearly target but it is tested and adjusted on 
					a monthly basis against market conditions and the prevailing 
					outlook. Right now we feel that we are starting to see a 
					growth phase, so we are looking at increasing inventory 
					levels slightly. This is being done on our core volume 
					models but we are not taking a risk on sports cars or highly 
					accessorised vehicles. As the market improves we look at 
					real value, real advice and real customer needs.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How did the year 2009 work out from a business point of 
					view?</b><br>
					<br>
					The year 2009 was like a hockey stick, the first three 
					months saw a definite slowdown in customer activity, but 
					from April, particularly from August onwards there was an 
					increase in sales volume. Overall, the actual impact was not 
					so huge, but it provided a good opportunity for customers to 
					bargain for better prices. In the beginning of 2009, there 
					was an element of fear, certainly concern for the future. On 
					a global basis none of us had foreseen the situation that we 
					saw in late 2008 or early 2009. But having a great team, 
					good brands, courage and taking swift action to reposition 
					the business by reinterpreting consumer needs and moving 
					ahead with a lot of hard work helped us to come across 2009 
					in a most satisfactory manner. A combination of clear 
					directives and a sense of humour aided the process.<br>
					<br>
					<b>What are the leadership essentials that you use at your 
					company?</b><br>
					<br>
					A lot of my role entails being visible, listening and having 
					the courage to take swift actions to achieve business 
					continuity and growth. The year 2009 was an opportunity to 
					revisit certain parts of the business, to study them and to 
					see how to do the business better.<br>

					The business model followed by Al Omaniya Financial Services 
					(AOFS) has stood it in good stead over the years. Can you 
					share some details about the model with us?</b><br>
&nbsp;<br>
					At AOFS we have a number of advantages like having an 
					opportunity to build this business brick-by-brick since its 
					inception. Being here since the beginning has helped me to 
					create every aspect of this business model and this has 
					proved to be a big advantage as we did not have to deal with 
					legacy issues. Our effort has been to create a business 
					model that is a win-win for every stakeholder – our 
					shareholders, directors, employees, the government (as we 
					pay taxes) and customers. If anyone in this loop feels that 
					he is not getting value he will not be in the business. 
					Employees want better salaries, job satisfaction and avenues 
					of self-actualisation. Customers want the best service, 
					consistency and low prices; the government wants higher 
					taxes. These are all conflicting objectives. So you need to 
					create a business model that balances all these conflicting 
					objectives and delivers value in terms of higher earnings 
					and dividends for stakeholders. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Do you believe that leadership styles change according to 
					the exigencies of the situation?</b><br>
					<br>
					Everyone has a vision and foresight, but the challenge is to 
					convert this into a strategy and to create something. At 
					AOFS we have been fortunate in having the right ideas and 
					putting a step-by-step game plan to meet these expectations. 
					I do not feel that there is anything called situational 
					leadership. Leaders have multi-layered personality traits 
					and based upon the situation one of those personality traits 
					emerges to address that specific situation or threat at a 
					critical point of time. We know that business cycles go up 
					and down, so our strategy is to reward our shareholders well 
					during good times and to reward them reasonably well during 
					bad times. The idea being to build long term sustainability 
					in the business plan. Once you come to execute this you need 
					to have a clear idea of the products that you are selling so 
					that you can create a value proposition for that product. It 
					is easy to launch a product but very difficult to sustain 
					it. <br>
					<br>
					We have changed with the times. When we started we were seen 
					as a car finance company and our corporate slogan was, ‘The 
					first name in car loans.’ When we moved into the second 
					phase, our slogan changed to, ‘We understand finance 
					better,’ and we started machinery and heavy equipment 
					financing.Today, we call ourselves, ‘Corporate finance 
					specialists’ as we cater to a large number of companies on a 
					variety of products, just like mainstream banks. When you 
					change, it has to be genuine and substantial rather than 
					merely cosmetic. As management theories will tell you, the 
					external environment is a given and one cannot change it; a 
					business leader has to adapt to this and still create value. 
					If the external environment was to your liking, then you 
					would not require business managers as anyone can buy and 
					sell.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
					<b>How did you go about negotiating the downturn in late 
					2008 and 2009?</b><br>
					<br>
					We could see the crisis coming before it actually hit in 
					2008. The role of a leader is to provide direction and as we 
					were prepared for the problems, the impact was minimal. We 
					put in place various measures to negotiate the slowdown. 
					One, we realigned our maturities. Second, we did a lot of 
					stress testing, with all the institutions that we deal with. 
					Third, the company started to maintain a much larger cash 
					position and triggered it’s contingency planning. For 
					example more focus started being given to housekeeping. The 
					corporate marketing and retail marketing teams started to 
					focus on remedial credit and managing debt rather than 
					adding new business. The first thing that I did at AOFS was 
					to call our staff and tell them in no uncertain terms that 
					no one would be terminated from this company. This gave 
					people the confidence and they pooled in their efforts. 
					These measures helped us to tide over the problems. In 2009 
					we made more money and profits than in 2008 and paid a 25 
					per cent dividend to our shareholders. <br>
					<br>
					<b>What are the values that a leader needs to have in 
					today’s business environment?</b> <br>
					<br>
					In business you have to be pragmatic, as one is sitting on 
					other people’s money. The two hallmarks of my leadership 
					philosophy is that we do not compromise on honesty and 
					transparency. The customers know that this company will not 
					take them for a ride. We follow all laws and regulations to 
					the T. These principles come from a belief that in business 
					you work with the community and not against it. My objective 
					is not just to maximise profits as that would be a short 
					term objective. Instead, our aim is to see whether we can 
					provide valuable service to the community that we work in. 
					By creating value for the community we create value for 
					ourselves. This guiding principle enables us to maintain the 
					asset quality that we have. AOFS has one of the best capital 
					structures. This has allowed us to have low capital 
					servicing, higher leverage capabilities, better lending 
					prowess and a solid capital base. That sums up why Al 
					Omaniya has been a forerunner and a consistent success.<br>
					<b>&nbsp;<br>
					How do you go about managing employee morale and 
					expectations in a downturn?</b><br>
					<br>
					One can have the best strategy but you still require a team 
					to execute it. This in turn requires people who believe in 
					what the company stands for. Employees also require an 
					environment where they can grow and meet their own goals. We 
					have successfully created a company where there is no 
					conflict between the goals of the organisation and 
					individuals. By advancing the goals of everyone we ensure 
					that everyone is pulling in the same direction. AOFS has 
					created what in modern parlance is known as an ‘engaged 
					employee.’ For example, when someone rings up our company, 
					the person says, ‘How can I help you.’<br>
					<br>
					If there is a query related to accounts and the call has 
					come to marketing, the executive will ring up the accounts 
					department, get the information and pass it onto the 
					customer. There are certain prerequisites for creating such 
					an environment. The company has few departmental or 
					functional barriers, enabling people to look at a situation 
					in a holistic way. Departmental barriers create power 
					centres and ego centre’s. When you manage to do away with 
					this and have a seamless organisation it creates an engaged 
					employee. It is a difficult process and happens over a 
					period of time. The command structure at AOFS is almost 
					flat, and though functionality is maintained, the doors are 
					open for everyone to come and speak to others. Overall, 
					barriers to communication are minimal and problems do not 
					develop into a crisis, as things get communicated quickly 
					and resolved.</font></td>

					</b>Some companies by virtue of the nature of their business 
					are better placed than others to tide over difficult 
					periods. During the turbulent period of mid-2008 and 2009, 
					most companies in Oman, like their counterparts around the 
					world, went through challenging times. While many managed to 
					sustain their businesses with their opening order book 
					backlog, companies like Al Hassan Engineering Co (AHEC) 
					faired better. In such situations, it’s important to remain 
					focussed in order to stay ahead of the rest.<br>
					<br>
					Says Peter Hall, CEO, AHEC, “If we were to review our 
					operations in 2009, we opened the year with a strong order 
					book. So in terms of revenue growth we had a good platform 
					on which to start. We also had a number of upcoming target 
					projects on which we based our order winning strategies. 
					These projects provided us with revenue for 2009 and a 
					backlog for 2010 and beyond. All this enabled the company to 
					achieve a good performance in 2009, giving greater value for 
					the shareholders. The turnover increased by over 20 per cent 
					and net profit increased by 30 per cent on 2008.”<br>
					<br>
					Hall is obviously very happy with the results but admits 
					that it was a challenging year. But since the company had 
					put in place a number of strategies and initiatives to both 
					win the targetted projects and to ensure their commercial 
					performance through the execution phase, the desired results 
					were achieved.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Significant orders</b><br>
					<br>
					Among others, the major new projects that AHEC won in 2009 
					included the 260 MW Amal Power Plant project from PDO. It 
					was also a particularly significant milestone as AHEC became 
					the first Omani contractor to take a full EPC contract for a 
					power plant in the country. This project is scheduled for 
					completion by mid-2011. Hall is quick to point out that over 
					the years AHEC has been involved in over 40 per cent of 
					power plants in the Sultanate including the 1000MW power 
					plant constructed for Sohar Aluminium by Alstom of France 
					for whom AHEC was a major subcontractor.<br>
					<br>
					The second major project in 2009 was the Gas Depletion 
					Compression project at Kauther for PDO. This was another 
					significant milestone for AHEC as it gave an opportunity to 
					develop our business relationship with a new customer, the 
					internationally renowned main contractor Petrofac who 
					awarded AHEC a sub-contract for civil, mechanical, 
					electrical and instrumentation installation. Work on this 
					project is due to be completed in early 2012.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Streamlining systems</b><br>
					<br>
					Elaborating on the strategies and initiatives implemented, 
					Hall says that in terms of business performance there are a 
					number of activities that were examined including internal 
					costs, efficiency andbusiness process re-engineering in 
					order to optimise the effectiveness and overall efficiency 
					of the organisation. One specific area was that of materials 
					management; many improvements were made in the supply chain 
					management cycle which have resulted in significant 
					improvements in the operational performance of the business. 
					We also made many improvements in our financial/accounting 
					reporting systems giving us greater transparency and timely 
					reporting of information on which we base our business 
					decisions.<br>
					<br>
					“The company went in for a major revamp of its website 
					keeping in mind its global audience of potential partners, 
					job seekers, customers, journalists and investors. Google 
					analytics reports have shown a 200 per cent increase in the 
					number of unique website visitors,” says Hall. The company’s 
					website www.al-hassan.com also won the First Prize in 
					Corporate Category at the prestigious Pan Arab web Awards in 
					June 2010. <br>
					<br>
					Hall did not fully support the view that the industry was in 
					crisis management mode, more than that the dynamics of the 
					market had changed albeit significantly as a result of the 
					prevailing economic climate. Oman, however, was perhaps less 
					significantly affected as elsewhere in the region. “By that 
					I mean that very few, if any of the projects that we were 
					working on were cancelled or shelved. It may have taken them 
					longer to move through to the contract commitment stage but 
					they did not actually stop. In this regard, I would say that 
					Oman has demonstrated more stability than other parts of the 
					region thanks to the policies put in place by His Majesty’s 
					Government. So those projects that we had targeted went 
					ahead as planned and our winning strategy worked well,” Hall 
					informs.<br>
					<br>
					Excellence in what you do is an advantage during difficult 
					times as it provides customers with confidence in your 
					delivery capabilities. And that was what AHEC did. “We 
					wanted to maintain our position in power generation where we 
					have a market share of 40 per cent. This consistency allowed 
					us to move up the value chain by undertaking the full EPC 
					for PDO’s power plant,” Hall points out.<br>
					<br>
					Similarly, in winning the Kauther project, where AHEC is a 
					subcontractor to Petrofac, AHEC’s strong reputation in 
					successfully completing a number of gas projects was a key 
					factor. In particular, the more recent Burhan/Harmal Gas 
					pipeline project where AHEC in very close and open 
					collaboration with PDO were able to bring in the project 
					completion some four months ahead of schedule clearly helped 
					demonstrate their capabilities and gave tremendous support 
					in securing this work with Petrofac as a new customer.<br>
					<br>
					<b>HR management</b><br>
					<br>
					An essential leadership quality is ability to build a good 
					team. A team that is able to carry on the good work with the 
					necessary help and support and with the right level of 
					autonomy to do their job. Staff retention is an area AHEC 
					paid attention to bringing in new people with essential 
					skills to grow the business.<br>
					<br>
					The company appointed in early 2009 a professional and 
					experienced HR manager who has undertaken a number of 
					initiatives including structured staff development 
					programmes and a management development centre to formalise 
					and control how it trains and develops staff. “Since we 
					carried over good order books in 2008 and 2009, if anything, 
					we are increasing the numbers of our people as opposed to 
					cutting down because of our growth. In addition, we had to 
					refocus ourselves and rearrange ourselves and our processes 
					to optimise the efficiency of our organisation in order to 
					maximise our productivity,” says Hall. <br>
					<br>
					Opportunities in Oman are good but clearly there is 
					increased competition which has challenged AHEC to implement 
					its strategies and initiatives to take advantage of the 
					situation and build on its reputation of safely delivering 
					quality projects on time.<br>
					<br>
					“We’ve got a reputation of delivering projects on time and 
					most importantly safely without lost time injury (LTI). We 
					have a total of more than 35 million man-hours without LTI 
					since 2007. We are a flexible organisation and we understand 
					the needs of our customers and we always strive to fulfil 
					their requirements. At the same time with our management 
					systems we ensure that we complete projects within budget 
					which is a significant consideration for us,” Hall says. As 
					they say, leaders do some situational changes, AHEC improved 
					its communication process so that everyone knew about the 
					challenges the company was facing.</font></td>

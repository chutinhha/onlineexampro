					discussion about the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). I am 
					assuming most of you, know what the GFC is. For those who 
					are not aware, the GFC was triggered by the eruption of the 
					US subprime lending (lending to poor quality borrowers) 
					crisis in the summer of 2007 and the subsequent liquidity 
					and confidence crisis that has spread on a global scale and 
					peaked in September and October 2008. The crisis is the 
					result of both market and regulatory failures. The US 
					subprime crisis, according to pundits, is a result of a 
					multitude of factors which include:</font><ul dir="ltr">
					<li dir="ltr">
					<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">

					<li dir="ltr">
					<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
					Excessive, reckless lending in the subprime sector, 
					especially for poor quality housing;</font></li>
					<li dir="ltr">
					<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
					Lack of adequate prudential regulation over financial 
					institutions; and</font></li>
					<li dir="ltr">
					<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
					The bursting of the housing price bubble.</font></li>
					</ul>
					<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr"> 
                    <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
					The consequences of the GFC have been far reaching. Across 
					the globe many businesses have gone under, investors have 
					lost billions of dollars as stock markets have collapsed, 
					jobs have been lost and the list goes on and on. In the US 
					for example despite the injection of billions of dollars as 
					stimulus package, the unemployment rate now stands at 9.8 
					per cent which is 26 years high and still climbing.<br>
					<br>
					The spillover effects of the GFC on Oman’s financial and 
					real economic activity have so far been, and will likely 
					continue to be, relatively limited. A report by Robert 
					Wigglesworth in the FT.com on October 5, 2009 for example 
					indicate that the net profit of commercial banks in Oman 
					rose almost 10 per cent last year. In terms of Omani banking 
					shares, by October 1, 2009, Oman banks had gained 2.6 per 
					cent from a year ago, while banks in other GCC countries 
					during the same period had registered loses. The report 
					attributes the condition of Oman’s banking sector to the 
					efficient surveillance framework and sound regulatory 
					structure of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), which is 
					considered the strictest regulator in the GCC region. <br>
					<br>
					What is troubling though regarding these crises is that they 
					are becoming much more frequent lately (Reinhart and Rogoff, 
					2008). The late 1940s to the early 1970s was relatively 
					calm. This calm is said to have been due to the heavy-handed 
					use of capital controls that followed for many years after 
					World War II. Since the early 1970s however, financial and 
					international capital account liberalisation took root 
					worldwide – so too have the financial crises. The US had its 
					savings and loan crisis beginning in 1984. During the late 
					1980s and early 1990s, the Nordic countries experienced some 
					of the worst banking crises following a surge in capital 
					inflows and real estate prices.<br>
					<br>
					In 1992, Japan’s asset price bubble burst and ushered in a 
					decade-long banking crisis. Problems in Mexico and Argentina 
					(1994-1995) were followed by the famous Asian crisis of 
					1997-1998, and then the troubles of Russia and Colombia, 
					among others. This was followed by Argentina in 2001 and 
					Uruguay in 2002 and then the current GFC which began in the 
					summer of 2007. This means we are bound to see more of these 
					crises in the recent future. The former US Federal Reserve 
					Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking to the BBC recently, to 
					mark the first anniversary of the collapse of US investment 
					bank Lehman Brothers, said another GFC is inevitable and 
					Britain will be hit worse than the US because it has a 
					globally-focused economy.<br>
					<br>
					If the world is likely to be hit by another financial 
					crisis, then countries needs to be concerned and needs to 
					prepare by taking the necessary precautions, if there are 
					precautions to take. Public awareness is perhaps one way to 
					prepare the populace to face future crises so as to minimise 
					their disruptive effects. To plan and launch public 
					awareness programmes, the government needs to know the level 
					of awareness of the Oman public. This study therefore seeks 
					to investigate the level of awareness of the Omani public 
					regarding the origin and the effects of the current global 
					financial crisis.<br>

					<b>Why public awareness is important<br>
					</b> </font>
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
					<br>
					Studies in the US such as the one by National Council on 
					Economic Education, Markow and Bagnaschi (2005) and the 
					National Foundation for Credit Counseling (2008) all have 
					documented very weak understandings of economic and personal 
					finance topics among teens and adults. High school graduates 
					go to college or the workforce ill-prepared to understand 
					the financial contracts that they sign and to realise 
					consequences of their obligations. Adults do not fare much 
					better either. These findings support the need for public 
					awareness programmes to bolster public financial literacy. 
					Sultan Qaboos University has embarked upon such an awareness 
					study.<br>
					<br>
					</font><b>
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
					Public awareness survey data</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Data for this study was collected by means of a 
					questionnaire administered to a random sample of 103 
					respondents. Our sample is comprised of professors, students 
					and staff at Sultan Qaboos University. The sample also 
					included members of the public from outside the university. 
					Students and staff were picked for the sample based on where 
					they come from across the Sultanate, in such a way that each 
					region of the Sultanate was proportionately represented. 
					Therefore the sample used in this study is reasonably 
					representative of the population.<br>

					Public awareness survey results<br>
					</font></b>
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
					<br>
					Data from the survey was analysed using Microsoft excel 
					spreadsheet. Simple statistics were computed. Results show 
					that 93 per cent of the people are aware or have heard about 
					the GFC. The remaining seven per cent said they haven’t 
					heard of the GFC and most of them were students. Regarding 
					the origin of the GFC, 78 per cent of the people who heard 
					about the GFC said its origins’ lay in the USA housing 
					market. Few people said the origin is political. In 
					addition, nine per cent of the people had no idea where the 
					GFC originated from.<br>
					<br>
					Respondents were asked to explain how the GFC is going to 
					affect them and their families. From the sample 25 per cent 
					said they are not affected, five per cent said they expect 
					to be affected but at the moment they are not. The 
					overwhelming majority 62 per cent said they are already 
					affected. Out of this group 40 per cent said they are 
					already affected in terms of increase in the prices of goods 
					and services. Another 40 per cent (61 per cent of them 
					students) said GFC will affect their career prospects, 
					because the recession will make it difficult for them to 
					find employment. The remaining 20 per cent said they have 
					been affected through their investments. On the positive 
					note, some respondents said they think real estate prices 
					(land and houses) will return to their pre-GFC levels in the 
					near future.<br>
					<br>
					With respect to how the Oman economy will be affected by the 
					GFC, 13 per cent of the respondents had no idea, 26 per cent 
					said the economy will not be affected much, and 10 per cent 
					said the economy will not be affected. </font>

					Interestingly, respondents did not say anything in relation 
					to the impact of the decline of property prices in Oman. 
					This has a severe effect on many corporate and personal 
					balance sheets – reducing the value of assets whilst leaving 
					the liabilities untouched. If people and businesses want to 
					restore their balance sheets by saving more and spending 
					less this will affect consumption.<br>
					<br>
					The main objective of this study was to investigate the 
					level of awareness of the Omani public. A random sample of 
					103 people comprised of professors, students and staff at 
					Sultan Qaboos University and members of the public was used 
					in this study. <br>
					<br>
					Result shows that people are reasonably aware of the origin 
					of the GFC, however only a small percentage of them were 
					able to pinpoint correctly how they were going to be 
					affected by the GFC. These results seem to suggest that 
					there is a need for public awareness programs to increase 
					the awareness of the Omani public. <br>

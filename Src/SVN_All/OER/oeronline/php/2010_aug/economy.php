					insulated from the global financial crisis, with the current 
					price trends suggesting a period of stability</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					</font>
					</b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					Oman’s real estate market was able to sail through the 
					economic downturn relatively unscathed, a fact many 
					attribute to opening up to foreign ownership in 2005 for GCC 
					citizens and in 2006 for the rest of the world, and then 
					only in designated areas known as Integrated Tourism 
					Complexes (ITCs). This spared the Omani property market from 
					the levels of property speculation which led to market 
					volatility elsewhere in the region.<br>
					<br>
					Like any generalisation though, this is too simplistic. The 
					strengths of Oman’s real estate market are many, and stem 
					from both proactive government oversight and the nature of 
					the Omani market – as well as the kind of investors it 
					attracts. And, there are weaknesses too, making Oman more 
					vulnerable in some respects than it need be to future swings 
					in the global financial markets. <br>
					<br>
					Chief among these is the fact that there is little reliable 
					information available about the real estate market. This is 
					a problem not just in the Sultanate, but the wider region 
					too. In the absence of regulation and publicly reported 
					statistics that govern the real estate market in most 
					western markets, it is difficult to assess how the Omani 
					property market is faring today and how resilient it will be 
					in the future. With this in mind, OBG has talked to a wide 
					range of sources in the industry, from government ministers 
					to the top real estate firms in the country. What we’ve 
					learned would fill small volumes, but for OER’s readers 
					we’ve done our best to distill the state of the market into 
					a convenient who, what, where and why.<br>
					<br>
					Who is investing: Oman has never been a big market for 
					speculators, and that’s still the case. The majority of 
					Oman’s properties are sold to end users or those who buy to 
					rent. In keeping with the Sultanate’s reputation as a 
					conservative, family-focused country, Oman is an ownership 
					society: 85.5 per cent of citizens own their house, 
					according to the Ministry of National Economy. As previously 
					mentioned, foreigners have only been able to buy property in 
					ITCs. The most well-known of these is The Wave, located near 
					Seeb International Airport, which will account for 50 per 
					cent of the freehold product available in the <br>
					<br>
					</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Muscat area through 
					2013.<br>
					</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					What is available: Pretty much everything. A variety of 
					projects commissioned in 2006-2007 are reaching completion, 
					meaning there are villas, apartments, retail and office 
					space on the market. Due to falling prices for a number of 
					construction materials in 2009-2010, the most recent 
					projects are often able to undercut the prices of products 
					which came to the market in 2008-2009. Two to three bedroom 
					apartments are the most in demand, according to a number of 
					realtors.<br>
					<br>
					The biggest gap in the market at the moment is affordable 
					housing – a problem often faced by countries with 
					fast-growing populations and a GCC-wide trend. In Muscat in 
					particular, development has produced a number of high-end 
					properties and fewer large housing projects. One reason 
					housing has remained focused on the higher-end is the height 
					cap on buildings, which has historically stood at five 
					floors. Recently, the government designated a number of 
					areas in the capital where apartment and office complexes of 
					up to twelve stories will be permitted, a move which should 
					lead to a better supply of affordable housing.<br>
					<br>
					Where to invest: New developments in up and coming 
					neighbourhoods. This counts in both Muscat and the wider 
					country in general. In the capital, the prime neighbourhoods 
					of Qurum and Madinat as Sultan Qaboos are fully developed 
					and demand some of the highest rents in the country. Yet, 
					Muscat is a dynamic city, and developments in the west in 
					particular show tremendous promise. Seeb, which lies west of 
					the airport, currently houses Sultan Qaboos University, the 
					premier university in the country, and a handful of 
					developments, and the area looks set to take off. In 2009, 
					52.5 per cent of all building permits issued by the Muscat 
					Municipality were for plots in this area, with the remaining 
					47.5 per cent distributed throughout the other five 
					districts in the capital.<br>
					<br>
					Because Oman does not restrict office space to certain zones 
					– people are allowed to work and run businesses from their 
					homes, if they wish – a lack of office space has not been as 
					much of an issue in Oman as it has been in other parts of 
					the Gulf. However, a number of companies have moved, or plan 
					to move, to purpose-built office buildings in Airport 
					Heights, which is projected to become the next business 
					district, housing a number of ministries and major 
					companies. Then, of course, there is the rest of the 
					country. The government has proven itself keen to invest in 
					alternate population centres to avoid overcentralisation in 
					Muscat. Improved infrastructure links, from the development 
					of four new airports at Sohar, Duqm, Ras al Hadd, and Adam 
					to the upcoming country-spanning railway, will cut transit 
					time throughout the GCC’s second largest country, making 
					far-flung cities like Salalah and Ras al Hadd all the more 
					attractive.<br>
					<br>
					One area particularly worth monitoring is Duqm. The site, 
					which is at the early stages of development, is envisioned 
					as the next great industrial hub for Oman and perhaps the 
					Gulf region. At 1234 km2, Duqm will be the largest Special 
					Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Middle East, with a focus on 
					industry, logistics, and tourism aimed at generating 
					employment. Depending on how the project progresses, the 
					area could become a magnet for developers keen to diversify 
					away from more established cities.<br>
					<br>
					Why Oman: Anyone reading this magazine probably does not 
					need to be convinced that Oman is a desirable place to live. 
					Muscat is popularly said to be the second cleanest capital 
					city in the world (after Singapore), and in the running for 
					the most livable. Traffic is minimal throughout the country 
					and an emphasis on sound urban planning has kept development 
					in check. But of course most residents will tell you that 
					Oman’s greatest richness lies not in its cities, but the 
					wealth of natural beauty outside them. The Omani people, 
					too, are justly famous for their warmth towards strangers. 
					With the four new airports currently under development, 
					exploration of the country’s interior will soon be easier 
					than ever.There are, of course, limitations. Oman does not 
					have a detailed legal framework to deal with property 
					disputes yet. Valuing property is difficult because of a 
					lack of standard valuation procedures. These are problems 
					common throughout the GCC and Oman would do well to become 
					one of the first countries to move on this front.<br>
					<br>
					Several industry insiders told OBG that while the timeline 
					for projects tends to be longer in Oman as compared to other 
					countries in the Gulf, there is much less risk involved. The 
					government and private sector have proven themselves 
					genuinely committed to bringing projects through to 
					completion. Developments are often ambitious, but also 
					realistic. Given this track record, the real estate sector’s 
					conservative but steady growth looks set to weather future 
					storms with the same fundamentals that saw it through 
					2008-2009.</font></p>

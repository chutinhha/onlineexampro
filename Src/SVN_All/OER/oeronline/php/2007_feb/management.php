</b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Michael Porter asks, and answers: 
Why do good managers set bad strategies?<br>
From Knowledge @ Wharton<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="management.jpg" width="191" height="202" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Errors in corporate strategy are often self-inflicted, and a singular focus on 
shareholder value is the Bermuda Triangle of strategy, according to Michael E. 
Porter, director of Harvard’s Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These were two of the takeaways from a recent talk by Porter – titled “Why Do 
Good Managers Set Bad Strategies?” – offered as part of Wharton’s SEI Center 
Distinguished Lecture Series. Porter stressed that managers get into trouble 
when they attempt to compete head on with other companies. No one wins that kind 
of struggle, he said. Instead, managers need to develop a clear strategy around 
their company’s unique place in the market. <br>
<br>
When Porter began studying strategy, he believed most strategic errors were 
caused by external factors, such as consumer trends. “But I have come to the 
realisation after 25 to 30 years that many, if not most, strategic errors come 
from within. The company does it to itself.” <br>
<br>
<b>Destructive Competition</b><br>
Bad strategy often stems from how managers think about competition, he noted. 
Many companies set out to be the best in their industry, and then the best in 
every aspect of business. The problem with that way of thinking is there is no 
best company in any industry. “What is the best car?” he asked. “It depends on 
who is using it. It depends on what it’s being used for. It depends on the 
budget.”<br>
<br>
Managers who think there’s one best company and one best set of processes set 
themselves up for destructive competition. “The worst error is to compete with 
your competition on the same things,” Porter said. “That only leads to 
escalation, which leads to lower prices or higher costs unless the competitor is 
inept.” Companies should strive to be unique. Managers should be asking, “How 
can you deliver a unique value to meet an important set of needs for an 
important set of customers?”<br>
<br>
Another mistake managers make is relying on a flawed definition of strategy, 
said Porter. Often corporate executives will confuse strategy with aspiration. 
For example, a company that proclaims its strategy is to become a technological 
leader has not described a strategy, but a goal. “Strategy has to do with what 
will make you unique,” Porter noted. Companies also make the mistake of 
confusing strategy with an action, such as a merger or outsourcing. “Is that a 
strategy? No. It doesn’t tell what unique position you will occupy.” <br>
<br>
A company’s definition of strategy is important, he said, because it predefines 
choices that will shape decisions and actions the company takes. Vision and 
mission statements should not be confused with strategy. In the last 10 years or 
so, Porter added, companies have become increasingly confused about corporate 
goals. The only goal that makes sense is for companies to earn a superior return 
on invested capital because that is the only goal that aligns with economic 
value. <br>
<br>
Porter said the “Bermuda Triangle of strategy” is confusion over economic 
performance and shareholder value. “We have had this horrendous decade where 
people thought the goal of a company is shareholder value. Shareholder value is 
a result. Shareholder value comes from creating superior economic performance.”
<br>
<br>
<b>Principles of Strategic Positioning</b><br>
Porter went on to describe key principles of strategic positioning, including a 
unique value proposition, a tailored value chain, clear tradeoffs in choosing 
what not to do and strategic continuation.<br>
<br>
To start, companies hoping to build a successful strategy need to define the 
right industry and the right products and services. Bad strategy often flows 
from a bad definition of the business, said Porter.<br>
<br>
He pointed to Sysco Corp., the No.1 food service supplier in North America. 
Defining Sysco simply as a food-distribution firm would eventually lead to a 
failed strategy. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="management1.jpg" width="190" height="127" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">The industry actually comprises two distinct sectors. One delivers food to small 
institutions that need help with finance and product selection. The other has 
large, fast-food franchise customers, like McDonald’s, that are not interested 
in any additional services. McDonald’s just wants industrial-size containers 
delivered on time at the best price. Sysco has developed two separate strategies 
for its two customers. <br>
<br>
Geographic focus is another type of business definition that can trip up 
strategy. He gave the example of a US lawn-care company that developed a plan to 
grow through international expansion. The business, however, was not suited to 
operating on a global scale. The products were expensive to ship, and the 
company had to deal with different retail channels in different regions.<br>
<br>
One more mistake managers make is confusing operational effectiveness with 
strategy. Operational effectiveness is, in essence, extending best practices. 
Good operations can drive performance, Porter said, but added: “The trouble with 
that is it’s hard to sustain. If it’s a best practice, everybody will do it, 
too.” <br>
<br>
None of this is easy, he conceded. “The real challenge of management is you have 
to keep up with best practices while solidifying, clarifying and enhancing your 
unique positions.”<br>
<br>
Managers often tend to let incremental improvements in operations crowd out the 
larger strategy of building a unique business that will retain its competitive 
advantage, Porter noted. To bypass this problem, managers must keep the 
competitive strategy in mind at all times. “Every day, every meeting, every 
decision, has to be clear.... Is this an operational best practice or is this 
something that’s improving on my strategic distinction?”</font><p align="justify" style="margin:5 10; "><font face="Verdana" size="1"><i>(Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate.)

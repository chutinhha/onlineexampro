        </font></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Both Haj and Umrah 
        contribute substantially to Saudi economy, writes Dr Jasim Husain Ali, 
        Economist and Member of Parliament, Bahrain</b></font></p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="gcc.jpg" width="400" height="212"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The monetary value of 
        diverse activities involving the annual Haj plus Umrah (little Haj) is 
        substantial. Having been to Makkah and Madinah to perform Haj this year, 
        I had the opportunity to get a first-hand account of numerous business 
        activities that take place during the annual Haj. I also managed to 
        compile some statistics related to the business side of these holy 
        shrines. <br>
        <br>
        Understandably, statistics for 2006 are yet to be released, which 
        incidentally witnessed two Haj seasons, at the start and towards the 
        year-end. Accordingly, the monetary value of 2006 could be unusually 
        inflated; thereby caution must be exercised when interpreting the 
        figures. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) has reported at 
        least 10 per cent increase in Haj-related business activities this 
        season. The BCCI reported that majority of expenses covered 
        accommodation and food expenses.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Substantial value</b><br>
        According to a field study conducted by a group of Saudi economists, the 
        value of all activities related to the holy shrines amounted to US$31 
        billion in 2005. Undoubtedly, the figure is substantial – representing 
        about 12 per cent of Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the 
        same year.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
        Thus, ‘the economy of holy places’, if I may say so, is exceptionally 
        significant. What is more, this economic activity is sustainable as 
        millions of Muslims tend to grab the first available opportunity to go 
        Makkah and Madinah. A good number of nationals from the six-nation Gulf 
        Cooperation Council (GCC) perform Haj on a regular basis, taking 
        advantage of the available conveniences. Thanks to the arrival of new 
        regional airliners, GCC travellers to the holy places have plenty of 
        options to choose from. And for good reasons, Saudi authorities recently 
        upgraded Jeddah’s King Abdul Aziz Airport to an international one. 
        Accordingly, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Airport in Madinah had to be 
        upgraded to make it fit for receiving international flights on a regular 
        basis. <br>
        <br>
        The hefty figure of US$31 billion covers spending by visitors to the 
        holy sites throughout the year and not just the annual Haj. This 
        includes Umrah that can be carried out at any time during the year, but 
        particularly famous during the fasting month of Ramadan. This is notably 
        true during the last ten days of Ramadan, when hundreds of thousands of 
        faithful go to Makkah asking Allah for forgiveness and blessing. The 
        holy Quran was descended during the last ten days of Ramadan. Owners of 
        retail shops close to the Grand Mosque consider the last ten days of 
        Ramadan the best time of the year with respect to revenues. The period 
        coincides with the eid or feasting, as parents tend to buy new clothes 
        and give other gifts to their children and loved ones. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Everything sells</b><br>
        Business owners contend that almost any product can be sold in the two 
        holy cities, especially during the Haj and Ramadan. Indeed, little if 
        any marketing is needed to generate business, as pilgrims like to buy 
        anything and everything. This partly reflects the fact that Islamic 
        teachings encourage Muslims to spend money while visiting Makkah and 
        Madinah as a sort of reward to those who live and work in the two holy 
        cities.<br>
        Visitors from abroad, rather than local pilgrims, are credited for being 
        the most profitable source of business here. Not surprisingly, 
        authorities are paying increased attention to the needs of pilgrims 
        coming from all over the world. <br>
        <br>
        Conversely, Saudi authorities place restrictions on nationals during the 
        Haj in order to make way for foreign nationals, who in turn are more 
        willing to spend. Many Saudi nationals use their own vehicles rather 
        than rent taxies. Some Saudi pilgrims tend to sleep in their own cars, 
        thus denying business opportunities for property owners. <br>
        <br>
        <b>More Facilities</b><br>
        A breakdown of statistics shows that 68 per cent of spending by pilgrims 
        relates to accommodation and living expenses. This partly explains the 
        rising number of hotels and restaurants opening in the holy places. The 
        next biggest spending covers the cost of animals offered as sacrifices, 
        amounting to about 9 per cent of total expenditures.<br>
        <br>
        The average cost of sacrificed animals, including butchering and 
        processing, amounts to about $125 per pilgrim. Other expenditures deal 
        with purchases of gifts and spending on telecommunications, including 
        the internet. Prepaid cards are widely available during the Haj season – 
        to such an extent that foreign workers (albeit covertly) offer these 
        cards for sale to visitors even while working at points of entry. <br>
        <br>
        Private sector firms try to get the maximum benefit from visitors to 
        Makkah and Madinah by offering pilgrims all sorts of conveniences. 
        American hotels and fast food restaurants are common in the vicinity of 
        the Grand Mosque. Coffee lovers need not worry, as Starbucks outlets can 
        be found in the holy places. <br>
        <br>
        The holy shrine in Madinah is encircled by an extraordinary array of 
        fine hotels and luxury furnished apartments, thereby allowing most 
        visitors to stay within the vicinity of Prophet Mohammad’s Mosque. In 
        fact, most if not all, visitors walk to the holy shrine. Renowned 
        international names such as InterContinental and Hilton hotels are 
        located near Prophet Mohammad’s Mosque. In fact, InterContinental is 
        noted for having several outlets in Madinah, assuming different 
        religious names (Dar Al Hijra and Dar Al Iman). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Gateway to Makkah </b><br>
        In addition to Makkah and Madinah, other cities in Saudi Arabia, notably 
        Jeddah and Taif, benefit from pilgrims. Of all, the biggest beneficiary 
        is Jeddah. This partly reflects the fact that King Abdul Aziz Airport in 
        Jeddah serves as the gateway to Makkah and there is no commercial 
        airport in the holy city of Makkah itself.<br>
        <br>
        King Abdul Aziz Airport currently handles 14 million passengers 
        annually, which is double its natural capacity. The airport attracts 
        nearly two-thirds of the foreign visitors to the holy places. There is 
        yet another benefit that accrues from the fact that most pilgrims use 
        land transport from Jeddah to travel to Makkah. <br>
        <br>
        After completion of this year’s Haj, Saudi authorities revealed an 
        ambitious plan to increase throughputs at King Abdul Aziz Airport to a 
        maximum of 80 million per year over three phases. By the end of the 
        first phase in 2011, the airport would be equipped to handle 30 million 
        passengers per year. Expansion plans include allowing private sector 
        entrepreneurs to develop hotels close to the airport. <br>
        <br>
        Saudi tourism authorities also encourage wealthy pilgrims to visit other 
        places of the country, including tourist sites in the south, the 
        industrial places in Yanbu and Jubail as well as the petroleum town in 
        Dammam. Pilgrims also tend to visit the capital city of Riyadh to meet 
        officials. Clearly, Saudi authorities are increasingly looking at the 
        annual Haj as an opportunity to market the vast kingdom together with 
        its ever expanding business potential.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Employment opportunities</b><br>
        The annual Haj season provides employment opportunities for thousands of 
        Saudi nationals. The season alleviates the employment challenge facing 
        the Kingdom. Many Saudis engage in simple trading activities such as 
        selling foodstuff and prayer beads. Yet others use their private 
        vehicles to transport pilgrims to different points in Makkah, notably to 
        and from the Grand Mosque. It is not possible for Saudi officials to 
        track the size of extra income in the absence of a comprehensive tax 
        system. <br>
        <br>
        Saudi entrepreneurs see the Haj and Umrah as unique business 
        opportunities to promote their products. Fortunately, Saudi Arabia is 
        home to a large number of industrial undertakings, especially in the 
        food and drink industry. Certainly, the concept of economies of scale is 
        at work during the Haj season in Saudi Arabia, as pilgrims consume a 
        large amount of food and drink items during the event. Some pilgrims 
        tend to stay in Saudi Arabia for longer than normal periods. This is 
        particularly true of pilgrims from countries in the Far-East such as 
        Indonesia, many of whom pay once in a lifetime visit to the holy places. 
        In practice, this means more business.<br>
        Nevertheless, Saudi authorities must exert efforts to end some illegal 
        practices during the Haj, such as the sale of expired goods, in turn 
        blamed for food poisoning of some pilgrims. The other challenge relates 
        to sale of fake branded goods, with little if any restriction from 
        municipality officials.<br>
        <br>
        The annual Haj or pilgrimage is thus increasingly becoming an important 
        contributor to the Saudi economy. This is because visitors to the 
        shrines in Makkah and Madinah spend a substantial amount of money on 
        accommodation, food, transportation, gifts and telecommunications, among 
        other activities. In short, it is not only the pilgrims who benefit from 
        visiting the holy shrines as they seek forgiveness from God, but also 
        numerous sections of Saudi society, including businessmen and owners of 
        houses and cars, find opportunities to get satisfying commercial 
        returns.</font></p>

        <img border="0" src="gcc1.jpg" width="150" height="114" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Notwithstanding its decline in ranking, Bahrain remains the most free 
        economy within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the larger Arab 
        world. <br>
        <br>
        The authorities, though, will be worried at the fall in Bahrain’s 
        ranking. Bahrain came down 14 positions in the 2007 Index of Economic 
        Freedom, thereby ranked 39th in the world. In 2006, the country’s 
        ranking had come down by five positions. <br>
        <br>
        The Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal publish the Index of 
        Economic Freedom report and both entities are noted for their 
        conservative ideologies and embracement of private sector initiatives. 
        They see government involvement in the economy as something negative. 
        According to the report, Bahrain’s economy is 68.4 per cent free 
        compared to 89.3 per cent in the case of Hong Kong, the most free 
        economy in the world.<br>
        The index uses the results of 10 variables to assign points to 
        countries. The variables are business freedom, trade policy, fiscal 
        burden, government intervention, monetary policy, foreign investment, 
        banking and finance, property rights, corruption, and labour freedom.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bahrain was awarded the best result (99.6 per cent) in fiscal freedom. 
        Undoubtedly, this reflected absence of tax on personal income. Also, 
        except for oil companies, commercial entities are not subjected to 
        corporate tax.<br>
        The next best performance relates to financial freedom, as Bahrain 
        serves the leading regional financial hub. Local and foreign individuals 
        and firms alike have access to market credit on market terms. Moreover, 
        foreign banks form a majority in the country (15 out of 25 commercial 
        banks in 2006). Bahrain achieved a score of 90 per cent in financial 
        freedom.<br>
        <br>
        Conversely, the worst performance (40 per cent) was recorded for labour 
        freedom. The report is not pleased with inflexible employment market, as 
        firms are required to hire Bahraini nationals. Also, firms are not 
        entirely free to dismiss workers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Tackling poverty <br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc2.jpg" width="150" height="192" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></b>Bahrain authorities are becoming increasingly serious in tackling 
        the poverty problem. The proof is that recently the government decided 
        to increase the amount of financial support extended to poor individuals 
        and households.<br>
        <br>
        A study conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
        contends that a Bahraini family consisting of six members is considered 
        poor if its monthly income falls below US$936. Accordingly, some 11 per 
        cent of Bahraini families fall into a category below what the UNDP deem 
        poor. <br>
        <br>
        As suggested, there is good news with respect to tackling the poverty 
        issue. Only in January, the Ministry of Social Development announced 
        substantial increases in cash handouts. Based on a revised payment 
        schedule, the Ministry will pay US$187 instead of US$133 per month for a 
        single person, which translates into a 40 per cent rise. Also, a family 
        consisting of five persons will obtain a maximum of US$398 per month, 
        showing a whopping 50 per cent growth in payout. <br>
        <br>
        In 2005, the Ministry extended financial support to 10,295 families. 
        There are about 80,000 families in Bahrain, indicating that nearly 13 
        per cent of families received some sort of financial support from the 
        government. Some 20,960 Bahraini nationals obtained financial support 
        from the Ministry of Social Development in 2005. According to official 
        statistics, 4.7 per cent of total 448,491 nationals got some sort of 
        support from the government to help them meet ends.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, many areas, especially villages, have their own locally 
        developed, independent, charitable entities that provide subsidies to 
        needy individuals and families. These charitable societies provide 
        support (either in cash or in kind) to more people, including some of 
        the same families receiving assistance from the government. <br>
		<br>
        It is believed that growing inflationary pressures have convinced the 
        authorities to increase financial support to needy people.<br>

        <img border="0" src="gcc3.jpg" width="150" height="115" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Saudi Arabia’s budget for fiscal 2007 is the largest of its kind in the 
        Kingdom’s history. The budget reflects the determination of the 
        authorities to generate maximum growth in the gross domestic product to 
        help tackle outstanding economic challenges. <br>
        <br>
        Total revenue is put at a hefty US$107 billion against spending of 
        US$106 billion, thereby projecting a $6 billion surplus. However, real 
        surplus would most likely be higher as the authorities have assumed the 
        average price of crude at US$35 per barrel. This is a rather 
        conservative figure and considerably below the average market rate. Oil 
        accounts for three-fourths of treasury income in Saudi Arabia. <br>
        <br>
        The increased spending should help Saudi officials solve some 
        outstanding challenges, notably of unemployment. The unemployment rate 
        stands anywhere between 8 to 13 per cent, depending on the source. 
        Undoubtedly, the problem is doubly dangerous as extremist groups tend to 
        find new recruits amongst the unemployed. Still, statistics are not 
        supportive, as one-third of nationals are below 15 years of age, thus 
        expected to enter the job market only in the next few years.<br>
        <br>
        The government has also allocated a robust US$26 billion for educational 
        services and another US$10 billion on health and other developmental 
        projects, all of which should help Saudi Arabia to improve its standing 
        on the human development index (HDI), annually published by United 
        Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Kingdom occupied the 76th 
        position on HDI in 2006, the worst result within the Gulf Cooperation 
        Council (GCC) countries. <br>
        <br>
        Private sector firms tend to take a lead from public spending. Projected 
        expenditures for fiscal year 2007 is some US$12 billion above budgeted 
        figure for 2006. Accordingly, stronger public sector commitment in 
        spending tends to be matched by firm investment commitment from private 
        sector companies. <br>
        <br>
        But, projections aside, what matters at the end of the day are actual 
        spending figures.</font></p>

		</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
        The UAE economy will grow by 6.2 per cent in 2007, down from the 
        estimated 9.3 per cent growth experienced last year, according to the 
        ‘Gulf Economic Forecast’ from HSBC Bank Middle East. The bank further 
        predicted that the UAE’s annual economic growth rate would slow down 
        slightly further in 2008, to an estimated 5.8 per cent.<br>
        However, the outlook remains bullish for the UAE economy for the coming 
        two years. The HSBC report forecasts the overall real growth will remain 
        high with the increase in the country’s real non-oil GDP to be even more 
        marked.<br>
        <br>
        Against this backdrop of broad-based growth, while predicting that the 
        country’s annual inflation rate will be seven per cent this year and 
        will drop further to 6.5 per cent in 2008, the bank also sees the 
        possibility of higher inflation as a real risk, especially in Dubai.<br>
        <br>
        Simon Williams, HSBC’s Middle East Economist, said: ‘The UAE is now 
        firmly established as an economic force to be reckoned with – not just 
        in the Gulf region but internationally. While the country’s overall rate 
        of economic growth will slow slightly in the next two years as oil 
        prices ease and production falls, the non-oil sector will continue to 
        expand strongly. The outlook for the UAE, and for UAE companies remains 
        good.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Steve Brice, Regional Head of Research, Standard Chartered 
        Bank, Dubai, inflation is expected to be moderate for most countries in 
        the region during 2007 and most obviously in case of the UAE.<br>
        <br>
        “We estimate that inflation in the UAE will plummet to 7.3 per cent in 
        2007 from 13.8 per cent in 2006. This is based on an expectation that 
        rent increases in Abu Dhabi will decelerate dramatically after the 
        Emirate imposed a 7 per cent cap on rent increases this year. A similar 
        decision in Dubai has not changed our forecast, although it does reduce 
        the uncertainty surrounding it,” says Brice in his report. In a 
        country-by-country analysis, HSBC report points out that the UAE offers 
        the most attractive balance for investors.<br>

        <img border="0" src="gcc4.jpg" width="150" height="136" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">Gold trade through Dubai reached US$14.75 billion in 2006, up 37 per 
        cent from 2005 when it was estimated at US$10.73 billion, according to 
        the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC). During 2004, gold trade 
        touched US$10.17 billion.<br>
        <br>
        A total of 489 tonnes of gold was imported into Dubai in 2006, while 
        exports increased by 23 per cent to 274 tonnes. In line with global 
        trends, there was a minor decrease in imports in 2006, which touched 522 
        tonnes in 2005, according to DMCC.<br>
        <br>
        Says Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO of DMCC: “The figures compare very well 
        against other global gold centres, particularly in Europe, where higher 
        gold prices resulted in significantly lower demand in 2006.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Colin Griffith, Executive Director for Gold at DMCC, “Gold 
        trade through Dubai remained remarkably steady throughout the year, 
        touching US$3.58 billion, US$4.06 billion, US$3.37 billion and US$3.74 
        billion, respectively, for the four quarters of 2006.”<br>
        <br>
        “Gold prices, which averaged US$604 per ounce in 2006, have rallied in 
        the last few years, backed by strong investor sentiment,” says Griffith 
        adding “Several factors are expected to impact the prices of gold this 
        year, including fluctuations in the US economy, the price of oil, and 
        social and political unrest around the globe. We expect the market to 
        remain extremely volatile as a result.”</font></p>

        A management restructuring that is expected to put in place a more 
        flexible executive infrastructure was announced by the government-owned

        <br>
        While the Chairmen and the Boards will be responsible for setting the 
        objectives and strategies for their respective entities, the Boards will 
        also maintain integrity through codes of ethics to safeguard the 
        credibility and reputation of their entities and that of Dubai Holding, 
        said Mohammad Al Gergawi, Executive Chairman of Dubai Holding.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the key appointments following the revamp include that of Hashim 
        Al Dabal, who has become the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dubai 
        Properties with Mohamed Bin Brek as CEO.<br>

        <b>Burj Dubai now 100 storeys high</b><br>
        Standing at a height of 347.3 metres, Burj Dubai is set to become the 
        tallest building in the world. It joins the league of six super-tall 
        buildings that are 100 or more storeys high in the world, according to 
        Emaar Properties.<br>
        The other six buildings are – Sears Tower in Chicago (110 floors), 
        Ryugyong Hotel in North Korea (105), Empire State Building, New York 
        (102), Taipei 101 (101) and John Hancock Centre, Chicago (100). <br>
        <br>
        Emaar Properties Chairman Mohamed Ali Alabbar; the company’s Board of 
        Directors and the designer of Burj Dubai, Mr Adrian Smith visited the 
        100th floor recently. Said Alabbar: “As one of only six super-tall 
        structures in the world with 100 storeys or more, Burj Dubai is already 
        an international landmark.”<br>
        <br>
        There are only 38 structures in the world that are 300 metres or more 
        high. It is now higher than three other tall structures in the region – 
        the Burj Al Arab (321 metres), Emirates Towers Hotel (309 metres) and 
        Kingdom Centre, Saudi Arabia (302 metres). Currently, only Emirates 
        Office Tower (355 metres) is taller than Burj Dubai in the Middle East 
        region.</font></p>

        <b>Qatar to embrace Scenario Planning </b><br>
        Qatar is all set to adopt Scenario Planning, a strategic planning method 
        to make flexible and long-term planning for a country given its rich 
        resources. Qatar is the first country in the region to experiment with 
        this model. Singapore, which has been successfully implementing it for 
        the last 10 years, has promised all its expertise to help Qatar adapt 
        the model. According to experts from Singapore on a visit to Qatar, 
        “Qatar and Singapore have many things in common. Both the countries are 
        small and we share a common synergy and there is a lot of potential for 
        mutual cooperation. The tool for scenario planning is a natural fit for 
        both the countries.” They said, “Our task is to familiarise the tools of 
        Scenario Planning with Qatar. These tools will help Qatar to identify 
        its local concerns, including the demographic patterns, education, 
        infrastructure development, health and banking sectors. Applying 
        scenario planning as a national governmental tool has its own special 
        challenges and problems. The tool kit that we provide to Qatar will help 
        them to face these challenges.” </font></p></td>

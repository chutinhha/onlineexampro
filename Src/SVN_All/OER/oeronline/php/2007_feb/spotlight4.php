<b>Ignore IT Governance At Your Own Peril</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>
<b>D. Balasubramaniam demystifies IT governance and emphasises how it can lead to 
best business practices and growth<br>
</b><br>
“IT has been the longest running disappointment in business for the last 30 
years”<br>
<b>– Jack Welch, Management Guru and ex-Chairman of GE, addressing the World 
Economic Forum meeting in 1997. </b> <br>
<br>
Ten years on, the outlook towards IT has changed a lot. Corporate and public 
sector bodies across the world have realised the importance of IT as a 
transformational tool and business enabler. The Information Systems Audit and 
Control Association (ISACA) and its associate body, IT Governance Institute (ITGI), 
have contributed much to the development of the IT governance and in creating 
the COBIT framework – a toolset that helps organisations to increase the value 
returns on their IT investments.<br>
<br>
<b>IT Governance </b><br>
The IT Governance Institute (www.itgi.com) defines: “IT governance is the 
responsibility of the board of directors and the executive management of an 
organisation. It consists of the leadership, organisational structures and 
processes that ensure that the organisation’s IT sustains and extends the 
organisation’s strategies and objectives.” <br>
<br>
The process of implementing IT governance starts from the time of acknowledging 
IT as a strategic, critical and integral component of “enterprise governance 
framework”. Studies indicate that businesses with a formal IT governance 
functions in place have earned about 25 per cent higher profit margins than 
those without proper governance.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, IT governance is concerned about two things –delivery of value to 
the business and mitigation of IT risks. The first is driven by the strategic 
alignment of IT with the business. The second is driven by embedding 
accountability into the enterprise. Both need to be supported by adequate 
resources and measured to ensure that results are obtained. This leads to the 
five main focus areas (domains) for IT governance:</font></p>

<b>IT Governance in Oman</b><br>
<img border="0" src="spotlight2.jpg" width="276" height="269" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">With heightened economic activity in the region, IT investment in Oman has been 
on the rise. Some corporate and government entities in the Sultanate are 
investing in IT and managing IT from a strategic standpoint, but a majority of 
organisations continue to look at IT as a simple support function.<br>
<br>
In Oman, while realisation has dawned that IT governance is an integral part of 
corporate governance, there continues to be lack of clear understanding. 
Questions frequently asked are: What is the right IT requirement for an 
organisation? What is the right investment? How does it benefit the organisation? 
How do we measure benefits? How do we determine return on investment? There also 
a need for qualified professionals to be part of the IT governance process so 
that the right answers can be provided to the management. <br>
<br>
The Information Technology Authority (ITA) of Oman is investing in efforts and 
resources to evolve an IT governance framework and an information security 
governance framework as a subset within the former, specifically for government 
agencies and affiliate bodies. The primary objective of the ITA is to transform 
Oman into a knowledge-based economy and enable delivery of government services 
via electronic channels – normally referred to as e-governance. In the process 
of integrating the eservices of various government agencies, ITA also seeks to 
help in strengthening internal IT processes and thereby maturing IT governance 
within all participating government bodies.<br>
<br>
The Muscat Chapter of ISACA has also been playing an active role in promoting 
the cause of IT governance and the COBIT framework in Oman. The chapter conducts 
regular seminars and workshops to create awareness on all domains of IT 
governance. The response for these activities from local IT and business 
professionals has been highly positive.</font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
The adage goes: What is not defined cannot be managed; What is not managed 
cannot be measured; What is not measured cannot be improved.<br>
<br>
IT governance precisely helps organisations in defining, managing, measuring and 
improving IT investments and processes. All Omani organisations need to include 
IT governance as a part of their boardroom agenda and manage IT from a business 
perspective rather than a technology perspective.<br>

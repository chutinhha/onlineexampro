        </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
		Kia Motors America (KMA) unveiled the all-new Kia Kue crossover concept 
		vehicle at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in 
		Detroit. The Kia Kue employs a different approach to the crossover 
		utility vehicle segment by taking elements of what makes a CUV to a new 
		level, namely performance. Kue is designed first and foremost as a 
		driver’s vehicle. While possessing SUV characteristics and capabilities, 
		the Kia Kue focuses more on giving the driver an exhilarating driving 
		experience on the way to the home improvement centre than on how much it 
		can haul. The Kia Kue has a moncooque platform that sits on 22-inch 
		tyres with a wheelbase of more than 114 inches, packaged in an overall 
		length of 186 inches. Though purely a concept, the Kia Kue does, 
		however, hint at future styling directions for Kia Motors. “Good design 
		shouldn’t look like you are trying too hard,” said Tom Kearns, KMA chief 
		designer. “The future Kia direction will incorporate the ‘less is more’ 
		philosophy but still include a heavy dose of boldness to be distinct.”<br>
		<br>
		With its four wheels pushed to the corners and exterior skin tautly 
		stretched over its underpinnings, the Kue sits powerful and poised. 
		Draped muscular wheel flares play a nice contrast to crisp bevelled 
		sections found elsewhere on the body. Swept back headlights connect to 
		the front grille to create a clean, aggressive down-road appearance. The 
		side window shape flows effortlessly into the rear backlight where two 
		centreline, hinging doors open to access rear storage.<br>

		register annual sales of 2,320, up 43 per cent over 2005. This growth 
		has been fuelled by a succession of new car and SUV launches throughout 
		2006. A best ever month of sales in the Middle East in December – GM’s 
		38th consecutive month of record sales – took total annual sales to 
		140,509, an increase of 24 per cent over 2005. This means that GM’s 
		sales in the region have almost tripled in the last three years. “Our 
		continued success is driven by the growing popularity of all our brands, 
		but especially by Chevrolet,” commented Terry Johnsson, Managing 
		Director of GM Middle East. “We launched 17 new models or new 
		generations of existing models in 2006 and these have been very well 
		received by customers throughout the Middle East.” Chevrolet is the main 
		driver of the GM growth in Oman. In 2006 sales of Chevrolet in Oman were 
		up by 30 per cent to 1,456. At the same time, the premium brands, 
		Cadillac and HUMMER, saw sales grow by 166 per cent to 359, while GMC 
		recorded a 59 per cent increase to 502.<br>

        <br>
		To Subaru, safety means protecting a car’s occupants in the event of a 
		collision and more. Ideally, a passenger vehicle should provide the 
		driver with the means to help avoid hazardous situations. Subaru calls 
		this concept Active Driving/Active Safety. This gives the driver a 
		strong sense of control, maneuverability and security. The Subaru 
		Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive forms the core of the Subaru Active 
		Driving/Active Safety concept. It gives a Subaru a significant traction 
		advantage over two-wheel drive cars (front- and/or rear-wheel drive) on 
		all road surfaces. On all 2007 Subaru models, the standard 4-channel / 
		4-sensor Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) incorporates Electronic 
		Brake-force Distribution (EBD).<br>
		<br>
		This system enhances braking performance and stability by actively 
		optimising braking force between the front and rear wheels according to 
		how the vehicle is loaded with passengers and cargo. Meanwhile, the 
		compact Subaru Boxer engine helps enhance safety, because it allows more 
		crush room in front and on the sides. Subaru vehicles are designed to 
		allow the entire power train to slide under the car along the floor 
		tunnel in a severe collision.<br>

				Hanna Al Kharusi’s dedication to every part of her job 
				irrespective of its importance or size holds a lesson for other 
				youngsters<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Have you never considered shifting jobs? That's something that 
				Hanna Al Kharusi, unit head, corporate banking division, 
				National Bank of Oman (NBO) gets asked quite often. “I joined 
				NBO in 2000 and still consider it to be my nesting ground, the 
				bank employed me when I had a degree unrelated to banking, 
				trained, invested and rewarded me. I have been recognised and 
				appreciated and I believe in loyalty towards an organisation,”
				<br>
				says Hanna. Well said. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Initial grounding</b><br>
				After doing her primary schooling in Oman, she moved to Holland 
				in class eleven as her father got posted to the Netherlands in 
				Hague. She honed her public speaking and communication skills in 
				school by participating in mock events like a model United 
				Nations, in which various schools represented different 
				countries. After school she proceeded to pursue a degree in 
				science from Indiana University in the US. <br>
				<br>
				On coming back to Oman Hanna looked around for a job related to 
				her science background but could not find anything challenging. 
				“It was then that one of my relatives suggested that I should 
				look for a job in banking, but since I had a background in 
				science I was a bit reluctant to take up a job in banking, but I 
				took it up as a challenge.” She applied at various banks and was 
				picked up by NBO to join their management trainee programme. 
				After a rigorous 12 month course she joined the bank’s corporate 
				banking division as an assistant relationship manager and has 
				got promoted as a relationship manager, senior relationship 
				manager and a unit head. <br>
				<br>
				Talking about her strengths she counts communication skills as 
				one of her biggest assets. Says Hanna, “This is something that I 
				acquired over the years, in schools there were shows like 
				show-and-tell, speeches, singing choirs and it is something that 
				I enjoy doing. Even in my job I do presentations for the higher 
				management and the board.” <br>
				<br>
				Apart from communication, commitment, dedication and a 
				willingness to take on even meagre jobs has stood her in good 
				stead. Hanna avers, “Nowadays there are a number of university 
				graduates who come out of college and want a managerial job 
				straight away, they need to realise that things do not work that 
				way.” She feels that a person who rises through the ranks, 
				learns over the years, which in turn gives him the confidence 
				and experience to excel. If someone is given things ahead of 
				one’s time, the person will not have the base, confidence and 
				experience to push forward.<br>
				<br>
				Speaking about young Omanis she says, “The new generation coming 
				into the workforce is quite ambitious, has a lot of potential 
				and a number of them have been educated locally, while during 
				our times, most people who used to go to a University came from 
				abroad as there was only SQU and two private colleges.” While 
				going abroad for an education has its advantages like giving 
				more exposure to different cultures and practices, a number of 
				local graduates have done equally well and so it is no longer a 
				key differentiator for success. <br>
				<br>
				Being a women has never been a constraint for her growth, on the 
				contrary it has helped her as people do not expect women to 
				deliver certain things but when they do so, it really shines. 
				Says Hanna, “Women need to work that much harder to prove 
				themselves, but there is no discrimination. In education there 
				is equality between men and women, but in the job market there 
				are certain industries which shy away from taking women as it is 
				a cultural thing, but things are changing and we hear about 
				women pilots, geologists and physicists and it is just a matter 
				of time before things change and women are accepted in these 
				kinds of jobs too.” <br>
				<br>
				She feels that the growth of Oman’s economy and development is 
				creating a lot of job opportunities for Omani youth and 
				youngsters should get a solid education, good communication and 
				interpersonal skills. As the competition gets tough education is 
				important so that one is on the same level field as everyone 
				else. <br>
				<br>
				Speaking about the kind of education that youngsters should aim 
				for Hanna says, “As long as you have a solid foundation, a work 
				ethic, reading skills and an ability to grasp things, it is not 
				essential to have a professional degree. While it helps to study 
				things that you can work around, it does not mean that if you do 
				liberal arts or science you cannot get into business or 
				engineering.” Finally it comes down to accentuating your 
				positives, identifying ones incompetencies and working on them. 
				Being a working women, wife and mother means that she is 
				constantly striving to strike a work-life balance – “It is 
				difficult and more so as one moves up as both ones job and 
				family are demanding, that’s a challenge that I am still working 
				to resolve,” says Hanna. </font>

				Hani Dawood al Zadjali has worked tirelessly on adding to his 
				knowledge base through education and experience enabling him to 
				do well</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				To advance in your career you need to grab every opportunity and 
				even half opportunities that come your way. I was there when 
				opportunities came my way,” says Hani Dawood Al Zadjali, head, 
				Human Resource Development, Oman Refineries and Petrochemicals 
				Company (ORPC). An alumni of Saidiya School and Ruwi Secondary 
				School he went to Kuwait to study Business Administration. 
				Though the course usually takes five years to complete, he 
				completed the course in three and a half years, by taking 
				additional classes during summers. On coming back to Oman he 
				joined the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF) as a systems 
				analyst in its IT department. It was here that he cut his teeth 
				in human resource management. Never one to sit on his laurels he 
				went onto get professional certifications from Oracle and 
				Microsoft. <br>
				<br>
				In 2006, he joined Sohar Refinery as an HR development officer 
				and did a course from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and 
				Development (CIPD). The decision to shift from SGRF was not an 
				easy one as he was offered a RO8,000 scholarship for doing a 
				masters at SGRF. When he decided to shift to ORPC, the fund 
				threatened to withdraw the offer if he changed jobs, after some 
				deliberation Hani stuck to his decision to join ORPC at the cost 
				of the scholarship. Looking back it proved to be the right move 
				as after the merger of Sohar Refinery and ORPC he was given the 
				charge of the entire HR department in the merged entity.<br>
				<b><br>
				The edge</b><br>
				“I am a fast learner, when I joined SGRF, IT was a new field for 
				me but over two years I built up my expertise in the field and 
				became one of the pillars of the company. Even at ORPC, there 
				were people who had 10 to 20 years of experience, but I got the 
				chance to head the HR department. This proves the point that if 
				you work hard you will achieve things,” says Hani. And when it 
				comes to work he brooks no compromises, like for example he gave 
				his CIPD dissertation on the day that he got married. “I had a 
				two week deadline to submit my dissertation on ERP, I kept on 
				communicating with my supervisor in UK and on my wedding day 
				went to the printing office and couriered my dissertation and 
				then went for my wedding. I was constantly juggling the two 
				responsibilities.” <br>
				<br>
				He feels that the window of opportunity is always there for 
				youngsters, but it all boils down to who is willing to grab 
				those chances. “Developing ones career is a challenge, but it 
				can be done if one has the right skills and temperament. It is 
				also important to coach youngsters so that they can do well.” 
				ORPC has a mentoring strategy to develop skills of young Omanis. 
				“The difference between a successful person and an unsuccessful 
				person is that the former takes the initiative to ask for work, 
				while the latter waits for things to come to them,” says Hani. 
				As the competition hots up it is important for people to stand 
				out. When Hani applied for a vacancy at ORPC he was surprised to 
				see 82 aspirants for a single job.<br>
				<br>
				He lists out a number of skills that young Omanis should try and 
				acquire – on the personal side one needs to have management, 
				analytical thinking, planning, teamwork and presentation skills. 
				While on the technical front one can specialise in various 
				disciplines like IT, HR, CIPD, CAT, ACCA etc. The right 
				behaviour and attitude are also of paramount importance as Hani 
				says, “One’s technical skills can be developed but attitude is 
				important because it reflects how a person will react to a 
				certain situation. Your attitude reflects your values, beliefs 
				and complements one’s work.”<br>
				<b><br>
				Big canvas</b><br>
				He feels that in the last 40 years we have achieved a lot but we 
				cannot just depend or rest on our past laurels. We need to say 
				that this is not enough, this is just the beginning. We have 
				talented youngsters and need to believe that we can do much 
				better, says Hani. He feels that there are times when people 
				start linking their personal matters with ones organisation and 
				it is important that people differentiate between what is 
				personal and what is professional. Young people need to take 
				constructive feedback positively so that they can grow. <br>
				<br>
				An avid traveler, finds it to be a great learning process. His 
				various tours to the US, UK, East Asia, Gulf etc have taught him 
				a lot about those cultures and people. For example, he admires 
				the sense of customer service in the US, discipline and planning 
				in Japan etc, “I was in Japan and they gave us an itinerary 
				stating that we had to leave the hotel at 12.07 pm, arrive at 
				the station at 12.11pm and board a train at 12.13 pm. I 
				marvelled at their discipline,” says Hani. <br>

				Temperament and life skills acquired from sports have helped 
				Taha Husain Al Raisi to excel in his corporate career<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				Taha Husain Al Raisi, department head of radio optimisation, 
				Nawras recollects an anecdote while working as a radio planner 
				with Omantel. “Our task was to connect two hubs in the Quriyat 
				area and as we could not hire a helicopter we decided to go 
				ahead on foot. The process would have been delayed by three 
				months if we failed to finalise on the sites that day. Starting 
				out we realised that we had to climb four mountains one after 
				the other in the Al Amerat area from 3pm onwards during summers. 
				After the team had climbed two mountains we found that it was 
				very hot and humid, to make matter worse we ran out of water.”<br>
				<br>
				Led by Taha the team prodded on and completed the work at hand. 
				By the time they came down a few of his colleagues had to given 
				medical help. Though it was difficult it proved to be a good 
				learning experience. This never say die attitude has helped Taha 
				to do well in a short career span. Coming from what he describes 
				as a telecom family (as his father, mother, uncle and cousins 
				worked in Omantel), joining the sector was an obvious choice for 
				him. Having started as a project engineer in Omantel over a four 
				year period he got promoted as a radio planner, a 3G team leader 
				and an acting section head.<br>
				<br>
				When Nawras was looking for a 3G planner and project manager he 
				saw it as an opportunity to take on a new challenge. As he had 
				been involved in selecting a 3G vendor and the requisite 
				equipments at Omantel, Taha had built up a good knowledge base. 
				In 2006 he joined Nawras as a 3G project manager. Two years 
				later he got promoted as a 3G planning and optimisation section 
				head and in 2009 he was promoted as a department head of 
				optimisation for 2G and 3G. “Nawras has a multicultural 
				environment and people are judged by their performance. Age and 
				nationality is not an issue and as long as you perform you can 
				grow in this company,” says Taha.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Looking back<br>
				</b>He did his primary and secondary education at Saidiya school 
				in Muscat, the oldest school in Oman and Ruwi Secondary school. 
				At the age of ten he started playing handball and has been a 
				keen sportsperson since then. He recollects the toil involved in 
				pursuing his passion, “As I stayed in Muscat it used to take me 
				an hour to walk down to Sidab club and then we played two to 
				three hours in the sun. I used to walk slowly to the club to 
				conserve energy and on match days, I walked through a mountain 
				which was a shorter distance.” All that hardwork though has paid 
				off in hindsight.<br>
				<br>
				Taha has been the captain of Oman’s handball team for the last 
				five years. The team finished runners up in the GCC cup in 2009. 
				At the club level he has won 11 league titles – nine with Sidab 
				and two while playing for Seeb. He feels that sports teaches one 
				to be a team player, inculcates discipline, hard work, ambition 
				and motivation. “You learn how to coach others, so that they 
				become better and help the team. In handball we use a lot of 
				body language and by reading people’s faces one can understand 
				that there is a question or a query. Overall it has helped me to 
				become a leader,” says Taha.<br>
				<br>
				At one stage he realised that he needed to curb his passion to 
				concentrate on his studies. “I was unfocussed and as luck would 
				have it broke my hand before my 12th exams – which was a crucial 
				factor in deciding my future,” says Taha. He felt that going 
				abroad for higher studies would help him to do better and he 
				decided to do a bachelor’s in electronic science from Chennai in 
				India. The exposure helped his confidence. At college he played 
				in the college basketball, handball and volleyball teams apart 
				from cricket and Kabaddi for fun. He was a foreign students 
				representative and deputy in-charge of the mess. “If you respect 
				people, they respect you. I have never shied away from seeking 
				help or getting help, sharing knowledge or approaching people,” 
				says Taha. On coming back to Oman he got job offers from PDO and 
				Omantel and he took up the latter and as they say there has been 
				no looking back since then. <br>
				<br>
				Looking at young Omanis he feels that they are talented but need 
				coaching and proper training. “Omanis are humble and nice but 
				they are also smart and hardworking. On the flip side they get 
				affected by the environment, if the place is competitive they 
				become competitive, but if there are lazy people around they 
				tend to become like them. This may not be true for everyone, but 
				holds true for a majority of youngsters,” says Taha.<br>

				An artist, a photographer, an MC, a DJ, a swimming trainer, 
				musician and a promising executive, Madiha Al Bakri, assistant 
				manager, Basma Marketing and Business Development, Oman Oil 
				Marketing Company (OOMCO) is all of this and more.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from talent, she also has strong views on various 
				subjects, here are a few examples:<br>
				<b><br>
				If you had the power to change something in Oman what would that 
				be? </b><br>
				Youngsters feel strongly repulsed by the Vasta (influence) 
				culture in Oman. Vasta is a strong thing not just in Oman but in 
				the Arab world in general and this needs to change.<br>
				<b><br>
				Does Oman offer enough growth opportunities for youngsters? </b>
				<br>
				Oman does not offer enough avenues for young people because 
				there are not enough forums to get recognised. If you are not at 
				the top or do not get enough publicity then you cannot reach 
				anywhere.<br>
				<b><br>
				Are people ready to work hard in life to achieve their goals?</b><br>
				There are people in senior positions in the private sector who 
				just come to work for the sake of it – they have coffee, read 
				the newspapers and go home, people need to want to work and if 
				they have it in them then there is no stopping them.<br>
				<br>
				Call it confidence, determination or arrogance, this streak has 
				enabled Madiha to successfully foray into unchartered terrain. 
				As a Basma marketer she goes to industrial areas like Ghala, 
				where few women are seen. Says Madiha, “Initially people used to 
				say that as a lady you should not be going to such areas, but I 
				go there to market cards and I make my company good money. I 
				want to prove that I can do this job as well as any other man. I 
				like that challenge and want to prove myself.”<br>
				<b><br>
				Keep growing</b><br>
				She feels that people should have the willingness to learn 
				constantly. “I have seen people in my age group who have 
				continued doing only one thing. You need to have a wide 
				knowledge and that’s what has brought me to where I am today.” 
				There are a lot of educated and creative Omanis, but they fail 
				to grow as there are not enough avenues for them to get 
				recognised. Talented youngsters can be encouraged by providing 
				them with workshops or public felicitations like the BizPro 
				awards. “There are a lot of avenues for the really young like 
				quizzing competitions, essay writing competitions etc, but more 
				such activities are needed for people in their twenties and 
				thirties.” <br>
				<br>
				After her high school in the US she did a major in marketing 
				from the Modern College of Business and Science, Muscat. She 
				worked in the US while studying there. On returning to Oman she 
				joined Nawras in 2005. Starting off as a front office executive 
				she got promoted to the back office technical department. After 
				a year and eight months she joined OOMCO, where she looks after 
				the pre paid card Basma. Her job includes sale, promotions and 
				marketing of Basma cards, getting in new merchants and sorting 
				out problems with the petrol stations etc. During a three and a 
				half year career she has been promoted from an executive to the 
				post of an assistant manager.<br>
				<br>
				She believes that she is good at communication, presentation, 
				speeches and creativity. “Communication was something that I 
				have been born with, my father was an artist and a photographer 
				and I got those skills from him. My mother was in IT and I got 
				my love for computers and presentation skills from her. When you 
				go out, you represent a product which may or may not be great, 
				but if you can communicate with your audience you can market a 
				product,” says Madiha.<br>
				<br>
				She feels that youngsters can be encouraged in a variety of ways 
				– for example if a company finds that a person has an 
				opportunity to study, then they should finance him. OOMCO 
				recently asked her to shoot pictures for the opening of the 
				Burger King outlet in the precincts of their petrol station on 
				Qurum Heights road. “It is very satisfying as it gave me the 
				feeling that I do not merely work for Basma cards, but also 
				bring my creativeness to work. People may get rewarded 
				monetarily, but it satisfies you only in the short term, bonuses 
				become meaningless after a point and start resembling bribery.”<br>
				<br>
				As one of the few women disc jockeys in Oman she has played DJ 
				at parties and at corporate events. She has also been a part of 
				the Royal Oman Symphony orchestra and is well versed with the 
				harp, clarinet and the saxophone. Though she has achieved a lot, 
				her dream is to be a public speaker – “I feel that I can 
				communicate with people and they will listen. If I had a chance 
				I would open a place where young Omanis can be trained in 
				multifarious talents,” says Madiha.<br>

				structured and mature approach have been the defining 
				characteristics of Said Salem Al Kathiri’s career<br>
				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				<br>
				Said Salem Al-Kathiri, senior manager, accounts, Dhofar Power 
				Company is someone who has seamlessly made a transition from the 
				public sector to the private sector. Having worked on both sides 
				of the divide he gives a firsthand account of their virtues and 
				drawbacks, “fresh graduates are looking for jobs in the private 
				sector and even those who are working for the government are 
				constantly on the lookout for opportunities in the private 
				sector.” He feels that the private sector helps in developing 
				ones skills, career and pays you better. On the other hand 
				companies are more demanding than the government and expect 
				their employees to work hard and contribute to the company. <br>
				<b><br>
				Two sides of the coin</b><br>
				A number of people prefer the public sector for its stability, 
				but Said chooses to disagree, “the private sector is as secure 
				as a government job as one can look for opportunities outside 
				the remit of one's company. Over the years your experience 
				becomes the main reference point in addition to your 
				qualifications.” <br>
				<br>
				While growing up in Salalah his father supported and encouraged 
				him to get a good education. He later joined Sultan Qaboos 
				University (SQU) to study commerce and economics with a major in 
				finance. A diligent student he stood second in the University.<br>
				<br>
				On passing out in 2000 he went back to Salalah and took up the 
				job of an accountant with the Ministry of Housing, Electricity 
				and Water. <br>
				<br>
				The start of the privatisation process of the electricity sector 
				saw Salalah Power being taken over by Dhofar Power Company. Said 
				went for an interview was shortlisted amongst 10 candidates who 
				were made an offer, he rejected the initial terms and 
				renegotiated a better package, “I was the youngest person to be 
				hired by the company and that too at double the salary of what I 
				was earning,” he says in jest. Dhofar Power is a subsidiary of 
				an US MNC – PSEG. After joining the company in 2003 he worked 
				hard to prove his mettle and his efforts were recognised. He was 
				promoted from manager - contracts and billing to manager - 
				accounts and billing in 2005. “The entire responsibility of the 
				accounts section was given to me.” In 2008 he got promoted again 
				as senior manager - accounts and billing. <br>
				<br>
				Learnt his lessons<br>
				Looking back he says, “I learnt from my bosses and subordinates. 
				It is important for people to ask for additional 
				responsibilities so that they can learn new skills. We need to 
				take on new challenges as we need to be a role model for the 
				next generation. With the new generation having educated 
				parents, the latter want their children to get everything that 
				they did not receive in life.”<br>
				<br>
				As the job market gets competitive it is important for people to 
				raise the bar. With more aspirants in the market, companies have 
				a wider choice of candidates. Apart from ones qualifications one 
				should have an interest in what one is doing, “You can have all 
				the qualifications but if you are not interested in what you are 
				doing it is of no help,” says Said. <br>
				<br>
				Ask him whether he resents the presence of a large number of 
				expatriates in the country and he says maturely, “Expatriates 
				are our partners in nation building, they have helped us in 
				bringing our country to this stage and they will be there to 
				develop our future. We do not see them as competitors, as a 
				developing country we lacked a skilled manpower base in the 
				early days, but as the local education and skills develop we can 
				take over, but there are enough opportunities for both nationals 
				and expatriates.” <br>
				<br>
				The government is looking at developing various projects in 
				Salalah like the free zone and a petrochemical cluster. In 
				addition to this tourism and air connectivity is also being 
				encouraged. In an effort to promote all round development of the 
				country other areas like Duqm and Sohar are also receiving a lot 
				of funding for infrastructure growth.<br>
				<br>
				Looking at such growth makes Said confident about his future 
				prospects. “My earlier objective was that after a few years in 
				my career when I sat down with my colleagues from my University, 
				I should be proud of myself. I have achieved some of my 
				objectives and I am confident that I can climb much higher.”<br>
				<br>
				He feels that instead of job hopping it is important to work for 
				a company as long as one is learning something, but if this 
				ceases then one is well within his rights to look for a change. 
				“I am still learning and that’s the reason that I have stayed 
				with this company. I am ready to shift to Muscat if the right 
				opportunity presents itself but if one is getting the right 
				opportunity in Salalah itself where one is closer to one's 
				family, then why should one shift,” says Said.

				<b>Single minded devotion and an ability to create opportunities 
				have aided Abdul RazZaQ al Zakwani’s career prospects<br>
				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				Abdul Razzaq al Zakwani, chief accountant Petrogas says, “In 
				1999 I used to often wonder about the growth opportunities in 
				Oman, but today there are so many new vistas that have opened 
				up.” The growth of the Sultanate has banished such doubts from 
				his mind, “I feel confident about our future, compared to other 
				countries our progress is steady and stable.” This is a 
				sentiment that is shared by many young Omanis today.<br>
				<br>
				Abdul Razzaq came to Oman at the age of 17, after finishing his 
				primary and a part of his secondary schooling in Africa. Though 
				his father wanted to go back to Africa, his children insisted on 
				staying back. As the medium of instruction in schools was 
				Arabic, Abdul Razzaq and his siblings were faced with the choice 
				of either going to India or to England to complete their higher 
				education. After some deliberation, he went to Panchagani in 
				Maharashtra, India to finish school. Once back he took up a job 
				as a clerk at Al Shatti hospital, it was here that he discovered 
				his interest in accountancy.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Changing streams<br>
				</b>His flair for accountancy was fuelled further by his an 
				uncle who was a chartered accountant and with whom Abdul Razzaq 
				was staying at that time. His uncle encouraged him to look at 
				accountancy as a career option. He decided to take a shot at the 
				CAT (Certified Accountant Technician) exams and to pursue it if 
				he did well. “I got 96 per cent in class and my teachers prodded 
				me on to go on.” He fondly remembers Mohammed Sajid Khan, who 
				taught him at Polyglot as one of his mentors. In the final year 
				he gave up his job to concentrate on his studies. He was offered 
				a job as an accountant at GAC and became a practicing 
				accountant. It was at GAC that he got a CAT qualification. No 
				mean feat as he managed to crack the test in two years.<br>
				<br>
				On the lookout for a better opportunity, he joined MB Petroleum 
				as an accountant in 2005. Being in a big group was an 
				overwhelming experience, but not one to give up easily, he put 
				forward his best foot. “I used to volunteer to work wherever 
				there was a gap.” His diligence soon caught the eye of his 
				bosses and he was promoted as a senior accountant within six 
				months. Taking up his work a few notches he also started 
				training his other Omani colleagues. After a year’s time he rose 
				to assistant chief accountant and then got promoted as the 
				acting financial controller. His flair for accountancy and 
				analytical abilities further aided his meteoric rise. He says in 
				jest, “My colleagues say that I was born as an accountant.”<br>
				<br>
				After spending three years in his new post, he felt that it was 
				time for him to explore new vistas and in an internal shift he 
				moved to Petrogas, a sister concern of MB Petroleum as a senior 
				accountant in 2008. “I was always keen to learn about the 
				exploration and production side of the business and this was a 
				good chance to do so,” he avers. Within six months he became the 
				acting finance manager and then the chief accountant.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Cutting edge<br>
				</b>Looking back he feels that he matured faster than his 
				compatriots due to the circumstances of his childhood. He 
				acquired a working knowledge of finance while helping his mother 
				to run her export and import shop as it required him to deal 
				with banks, cheques etc. At school he was chosen as a captain, 
				adding to his sense of responsibility.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from his maturity his socially amiable nature has helped 
				him to cultivate a large network of friends and well wishers. 
				“As doctors and financiers you need to trust a number of people 
				and your words carry a lot of credence in the market. For 
				example in a difficult year like 2009 my network helped in 
				getting better interest rates and bargaining for better terms 
				from people in the market,” says Abdul Razzaq.<br>
				<br>
				He feels that young Omani graduates are a bit scared and shy 
				initially in their job, but they learn fast and are ready to 
				shoulder bigger responsibilities. In return they expect freedom, 
				transparency, trust and appreciation from their superiors and 
				the company. Communication and a flair for English plays a big 
				role in a person’s growth and he feels that though the medium of 
				education in Oman is English, young Omanis still need to improve 
				their language skills. A friendly disposition is equally 
				important, “We Arabs tend to lose our cool easily and need to 
				control our anger,” says Abdul Razzaq.<br>
				<br>
				He feels strongly about people who do not have shelter and he 
				says that if everyone only gave one per cent of what they earned 
				it would be enough to provide houses for so many people. “It is 
				a part of our religion and we are taught to help the needy, we 
				believe that when we help others we help ourselves,” says Abdul 
				Razzaq.<br>

				Juma Khamis Al Sulaimani is a firm believer in the old word 
				virtues of hard work, application and perseverance<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Juma Khamis Al Sulaimani, unit head Mid Corporates, BankDhofar 
				narrates an experience: “While working in the bank's credit card 
				centre in 2002, I found that we were using software systems from 
				Bahrain in accordance with which we used to fill out the card 
				application and courier it to Bahrain. The office out there used 
				to send us back the cards along with thick reports. The process 
				used to cost us a lot of money every month. On questioning the 
				process I was told that the process was being followed for six 
				years. I suggested that since we had a software we could 
				possibly create a connection between Oman and Bahrain. On 
				delving deeper we found that there was a software which could 
				connect the two centres. The software cost us RO2,000 but saved 
				the bank $16,000 (RO6,250) a month.”<br>
				<br>
				Juma joined BankDhofar in 1996 as a trainee as the bank was 
				looking for people who could be sponsored and sent to the US. 
				The idea was to put people in the main branches in or outside 
				Muscat. He was sent to pursue a bachelors degree in finance from 
				the University of North Texas in 2002. On reurning, he was 
				attached to the card services centre, as an officer. Since he 
				had a degree in finance he was shifted to corporate banking in 
				2003 as officer one. From officer one he got promoted to officer 
				two, credit manager and a unit head in 2009. <br>
				<br>
				“I was raised in a particular way by my parents and teachers who 
				taught me that it was important to do things professionally and 
				to do things perfectly. I inculcated the habit of doing things 
				perfectly whether it was in my games, studies or hobbies,” says 
				Juma. A firm believer in the credo that nothing comes easy in 
				life, he has always been ready to apply himself. For example as 
				a non English speaker when he found it difficult to find a job 
				in the US he started working in the University library. His job 
				included organising the shelves and helping others to find 
				books. After some time he moved to the computer lab and worked 
				there for a few months. <br>
				<br>
				That’s when he saw a vacancy ad in a telecommunication company 
				called – GTI. He recalls, “In the interview I was asked to read 
				a long paragraph in English as the job entailed customer 
				service. When I left the room I was sure that I would never get 
				the job as my language skills were limited.” But as luck would 
				have it he got the job. Starting as a data entry person he rose 
				to the position of an operations manager. “I learnt the 
				importance of profitability, targets etc there. This experience 
				helped me understand that when you are working in a private 
				organisation you have to generate profits.” He was the only 
				Omani in his batch who was working and studying simultaneously. 
				“I used to go for my classes in the morning and in the evening I 
				went for this job,” says Juma. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Standing out<br>
				</b>Juma thinks that he has good communication skills in terms 
				of talking to people, listening and being friendly with them. 
				“Communication is important because that is the way that you get 
				your contacts.” As people in the trade would tell you having 
				good contacts is one of the principal factors in bringing in 
				business in corporate banking. Secondly, he takes quick 
				decisions. Looking around he sees a lot of opportunities in Oman 
				and feels sorry for people who are not planning their careers. 
				“We are growing, the country is growing, so there are a number 
				of opportunities. Youngsters who are depending on others are 
				making a mistake as they have to plan for themselves. The 
				government cannot do everything, people have to do things for 
				themselves.” <br>
				<br>
				One should know as to what is expected of him if you want to 
				reach a certain position. “When I was an officer in the card 
				centre and was starting a career I knew nothing about banking 
				and felt that it was not appropriate to call myself an officer, 
				I told my team not to treat me as an officer but just as a 
				clerk. I started by photocopying, writing vouchers, sending 
				cards and receiving cards.” He felt that since an officers job 
				was to supervise all these functions it was important for him to 
				know about these before he could supervise them. “If I want to 
				be a credit manager, I need to have certain qualities like 
				writing proposals, reading financial statements, making 
				decisions etc.” <br>
				<br>
				His advice for youngsters is simple, “everyone should have a 
				role model and see what qualities that person possesses. They 
				should plan realistically and have patience, one should not try 
				to jump from one to five, but go slowly from one to two and then 
				to three, but one should always aim for five,” says Juma. <br>

				Ali Al Balushi urges Omani youth to make the most out of the 
				available opportunities<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				When Aliya Ali Al Balushi first went abroad for her studies in 
				1999, extended family members expressed concern because very few 
				girls in her family had gone abroad for further studies at that 
				time. Being alone in a foreign country at a young age was a 
				scenario they could not envisage. However, the determination, 
				faith and trust shown by her parents made her determined to 
				pursue her higher education.<br>
				<br>
				However, all that was in the past. Today Aliya Ali Al Balushi 
				has returned twice from the UK armed with degrees and is a 
				successful career woman as relationship manager, Wholesale 
				Banking and International Operations, Executive Management in 
				BankMuscat. <br>
				<br>
				“Family support is absolutely essential, because in a 
				conservative society like ours, it is the parents who take the 
				risk to give you good education,” says Aliya. “It is up to us to 
				prove to ourselves and our families that we can do it,” she 
				says. “When I was young and at a time when the role of a woman 
				was to stay home and have kids, my father provided me – being 
				the eldest – support and encouragement. He instilled different 
				beliefs in us siblings (two sisters and one brother) that women 
				have the same capabilities as men and that they can be as 
				successful. So the mental barriers were removed. I think family, 
				in that sense, is more important for you to become successful in 
				life,” she says.<br>
				<b><br>
				Two-way street</b><br>
				Achieving success in a career is a two-way affair – the 
				individual’s desire to excel and the organisation’s (where you 
				are working) willingness to support you. Having a good 
				organisation like BankMuscat that recognises good people, 
				develops, and trains them is important to be successful.<br>
				Aliya passed out from the Sultan’s School in 1999 and went on to 
				pursue her bachelor’s degree in the University of Nottingham in 
				Accounting Finance and Management. After four years, she 
				returned and got a job with BankMuscat and has been there since 
				2003. <br>
				<br>
				She began as an assistant manager in the corporate 
				communications department and got a lot of exposure dealing with 
				the various departments of the bank as well as with outside 
				people. It increased her confidence and general knowledge about 
				the banking sector.<br>
				<br>
				Of uttermost importance, says Aliya, is having the desire to 
				develop yourself and the will and drive to become someone and 
				make the best of opportunities that are available which help you 
				to become successful. <br>
				<br>
				Citing her own example, she says, she could have just said, okay 
				the bachelors degree is enough and been satisfied with the job. 
				But she decided that she needed to continue to do a master’s 
				programme to advance her career. And, fortunately, BankMuscat 
				gave her the chance to do it by supporting her financially when 
				she got the Chevening scholarship for an MBA programme at the 
				Durham University in England.<br>
				<br>
				Being faithful to your own culture and values also helps you to 
				develop a respect for other cultures. This is valuable when you 
				work in a multi-cultural work environment like that of 
				BankMuscat, opines Aliya. “When you tend to meet a lot of people 
				from different cultures, you need to adapt to their 
				personalities and see their strengths. This helps you in your 
				career and your personal life,” she says.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Eyeing opportunities<br>
				</b>Aliya remarks that there are many opportunities currently 
				presented to Omani youth, all they have to do is to find them.
				<br>
				<br>
				“The chances are definitely there. Just take scholarships for 
				example. We have the Chevening and the Fullbright. Besides this, 
				if you just open the newspapers you will find plenty of 
				scholarships. Sometimes you need to look for it, work hard and 
				prove yourselves.”<br>
				<br>
				There has to be a culture shift, believes Aliya. You should 
				drive yourself and not wait for others or the government to give 
				you something. The State has already formulated laws like the 
				Omanisation regulations to help youth get jobs. As for women, 
				His Majesty The Sultan has emphasised the rights of women and 
				made sure that she takes her rightful place in the society.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Parental support<br>
				</b>Proper guidance, a good education, respect for others, 
				open-mindedness, being aware of your strengths and weaknesses; 
				being flexible and ready to explore and the keenness to develop 
				oneself would go a long way in enabling Omani youth to become 
				achievers in life, observes Aliya. Amidst all this, parental 
				support also plays a key role. When parents teach their children 
				to be independent and responsible, they develop a positive 
				attitude towards life and become successful.<br>
				<br>
				If at all she had a chance to bring about change in the society, 
				she would focus on the SME sector, says Aliya, and adds that we 
				need to encourage entrepreneurship in individuals and introduce 
				the concept to individuals from a young age. There are many 
				youth who have bright ideas but do not find the support and 
				guidance to turn their ideas into a reality.<br>

				</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#333333"><b>Ambition 
				and drive to be a topper and not settle for anything less got 
				Saud Al Shezawi to his present position<br>
				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				Saud Al Shezawi, Regional Manager, Oman Oil Marketing Company 
				hails from a family where most of his siblings occupy well-to-do 
				positions. One of his brother, Mohammed, is a journalist with 
				Arabic newspaper Oman, while his brother-in-law is with another 
				Arabic newspaper Al Shabiba. Another of his sibling is with the 
				PDO. With a proud lineage like this, it was only natural that 
				Saud was inspired to make himself big in life. The signs were 
				there early on. While studying at the Sohar Secondary School, he 
				scored high marks in all subjects paving the way for him to bag 
				a fully funded Ministry of Higher Education scholarship to go 
				abroad for further studies.<br>
				<br>
				He graduated from the California State University, US, in 
				December 2004 in Business Administration concentrating on 
				management information systems. During the five years at the 
				California University, he bagged a number of awards as the best 
				student. Saud was among the top three percent of graduates and 
				received the Magna Cum Laude Certificate and was judged as being 
				amongst the top five percent in the business school <br>
				of the university.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Family support<br>
				</b>Says Saud, “I always receive encouragement from my family 
				especially from my mother while my siblings who are all in top 
				positions inspired me to follow in their footsteps. That 
				ambition and drive to be at the top and not settle for anything 
				less has been one of the reasons which has helped me to do well 
				in life.”<br>
				<br>
				After returning from the States, Saud joined Gulf Stone Company 
				as a senior marketing executive. Later when opportunity arose, 
				he moved to Oman Oil Marketing Company (OOMCO) in 2006 as a Fuel 
				Cards business manager. He was then promoted as regional manager 
				of OOMCO office in Sohar where he is building up his experience 
				and profile in different areas of management.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks to his ability to learn and grasp things quickly and take 
				on challenges, Saud was quick of the block to maximise on the 
				management’s continuous support and encouragement. Not a person 
				to let go of an opportunity, he utilised the freedom to be 
				creative and make independent decisions. Naturally, accolades 
				followed. Saud got the ‘Best achievement in collection’ award in 
				2007 and was named as ‘Manager of the year’ in 2008.<br>
				<br>
				“Good on the job training, examples of leaders, opportunities at 
				work, my ability to make decisions, take the lead and solve 
				problems, have all shaped me and contributed to my growth, 
				points out Saud.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Opportunities galore<br>
				</b>Oman is a young country, with a majority of the population 
				being under the age of 30. And, definitely, there are enough 
				opportunities for all the youngsters in Oman, opines Saud, while 
				saying that you can now see a lot of young doctors, lawyers, 
				engineers, managers and many other young Omani professionals. If 
				one company does not employ you then it means they do not need 
				your skills so look for a place, which needs you. Sometimes you 
				may start with a low paying job, but then you move up and to a 
				better company and better offer.<br>
				<br>
				Saud cites the example of Sohar city where most of the people 
				have taken up the jobs either in the port, industrial estate or 
				in the shopping malls. You rarely find someone sitting at home 
				idle, he says. According to him, the most important skill 
				essential for young Omanis to do well in life is the ability to 
				learn things quickly and apply what you learn in your life. He 
				also believes that everyone should aim to have strong 
				communication, planning, implementation/execution skills, as 
				these are important to succeed in a challenging business 
				environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Top jobs<br>
				</b>Many Omanis now are acquiring leadership skills and landing 
				managerial jobs such as supervisors, managers and CEOs and many 
				of them are relatively young, says Saud. That is because of the 
				availability of opportunities, he adds.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from leadership skills, Omanis also need to hone their 
				language abilities especially in English, both written and oral, 
				besides soft-skills like IT, because most of the companies have 
				modernised themselves and look for candidates who can work in 
				multi-cultural environment using the latest computers and 
				software.<br>
				<br>
				Saud adds that it would help a lot if his Omani brothers learn 
				project management in order to be successful and move up the 
				career ladder very quickly. Companies are looking for people who 
				have the ability to meet and cope up with deadlines and deal 
				with challenges.<br>
				<br>
				Young executives could benefit from appreciation and 
				encouragement besides guidance from their line managers or 
				seniors, explains Saud, while disclosing what Omanis expect from 
				their seniors at work. Support and knowledge sharing from 
				seniors will assist Omani youngsters to build themselves up. You 
				learn numerous things like time management, presentation skills 
				etc from your seniors, he feels.<br>
				<br>
				Saud has a strong opinion about road safety and wants to do his 
				bit to change people’s perception on safety. His road-safety 
				awareness came about while studying in the US where it is rare 
				to see any driver breaking any kind of road-rules. “During the 
				five years that I spent in the US, I hardly came across anyone 
				who said their family member were injured in an accident but 
				here in Oman, it is so common to hear from friends and family 
				about the loss of their loved ones in road mishaps,” he says.<br>
				<br>
				“I want everyone in the society to care about safety while 
				driving. I would love to see seatbelts being used by all 
				passengers in the car. I want to see child seats being used 
				always, and mobile phones never used while driving. And most 
				importantly, do not exceed speed limits,” adds Saud.<br>

				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				Shadli Al Abdulsalam, product manager, business solutions and 
				MNP, Nawras, Business, believes in a 20-60-20 rule in life. He 
				explains, “The 20 per cent of the people on the bottom on the 
				corporate ladder never make much of an effort. The 60 per cent 
				of the people in the middle rung are average and are happy to be 
				stuck at the same position where they are, while the 20 per cent 
				at the top work hard in life, take chances and move up.”<br>
				<br>
				He joined Nawras in October 2004. The telecom major was setting 
				up its operations in Oman at that time and Shadli came on board 
				as a shop representative. Within a month he was promoted as an 
				assistant manager of shops. When the company set up six shops, 
				he was made the assistant manager of their airport and City 
				Centre kiosks and soon became the manager of the airport shop. 
				He says, “I used to work 16-18 hours a day when I started out at 
				Nawras, the management recognised this and promoted me. If you 
				do not sacrifice something then you should not expect to do well 
				in life.” <br>
				<br>
				After a year and a half he was promoted as the head of the 
				Business Sales and Support section. The department focused on 
				after sales service and his job was to focus on pre sales as its 
				project manager. In 2008, he was moved to the marketing 
				department as a product manager for Business Solutions and 
				Mobile Number Portability. “As a product manager my job is to 
				look into the marketing, sales channel, the services required 
				and adhoc solutions.” From consumer marketing Shadli has moved 
				into business marketing now. “Nawras as a company keeps me on my 
				toes. Telecom is a challenging sector and it is a new day every 
				day. As a working environment we have an open office and an open 
				management system,” says Shadli. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Great expectations <br>
				</b>He feels that young executives expect their company and 
				managers to get the best out of them, to guide and mentor them 
				apart from giving them a transparent environment with all round 
				communication. When people are not kept in the loop they get 
				demotivated. He has just completed his post graduate diploma 
				from the Institute of Leadership and Management, UK. Nawras 
				selected 16 people for the course and Sahdli devoted one week 
				every month to write his thesis. He feels that it is an avenue 
				for him to do a MBA. <br>
				<br>
				“I am a self motivator and have a vision for myself. My 
				communication and analytical abilities are good but I still need 
				to work on organising my time, I tend to take on more work than 
				what I can deliver and need to learn to say No,” he avers. His 
				advice to youngsters is simple – take interest in your work and 
				do more than what is expected from you. “People in the US start 
				working at the age of 15 they go to McDonalds and serve as an 
				intern, this builds their character and experience. They learn 
				to become independent and to provide for themselves and push 
				themselves.” <br>
				<br>
				He feels that youngsters in Oman are looking for challenges, I 
				have seen sales support ladies who are ambitious and are ready 
				to work hard. The country is moving up and it is diversifying 
				from being dependent on the oil and gas sector, tourism is 
				opening up and the employment rate will go up as these 
				opportunities open up. In the early 1990s the country used to be 
				a government oriented country, but that has changed now. The 
				country is moving fast. “When I came back to Oman from Canada 
				after seven years, it was a culture shock as Oman had moved on.” 
				As more graduates come into the job market the existing 
				industries will not be able to absorb all of them and so they 
				need to get into the service sector. <br>
				There are opportunities but people need to keep their eyes on 
				the ball. “I constantly analyse as to where I was, where I am 
				and where I want to go. I do this road map every year. People 
				need to keep doing research, keep up one’s contacts, network, 
				look at catalogues and exhibitions etc,” says Shadli. In today’s 
				competitive environment Omanis cannot do a bachelors and expect 
				to start at a managerial level. You may have to start as a sales 
				executive to get to a particular level. <br>
				<br>
				Shadli got an associate degree from Malaysia’s Damansarautama 
				college in 1997. He moved to Ottawa in Canada in 1999 to do a 
				business administration degree, though he dropped out from the 
				course mid way he gained valuable experience working in a 
				variety of jobs over seven years. He started by doing 
				door-to-door selling, then moved to UAC, a third party call 
				centre which used to service clients like P&amp;G, Haier, Black &amp; 
				Decker.<br>

				<b><br>
				What kind of skills sets and personality traits do you look for

				The candidates are assessed on the following competencies:<br>
				Leadership and people management: Ability to coordinate,

				completion of tasks or assignments.<br>
				<br>
				Critical analysis and decision making: Ability to analyse

				information and ideas in a manner that engages the audience, 
				helps them understand and retain the message, and permits 
				response and feedback from the audience.<br>

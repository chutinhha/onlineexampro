				<br>
				The first Oman Green Awards (OGA) awards function is being held 
				on World Environment Day to celebrate the achievements of 
				organisations and individuals. OGA will give green groups a 
				platform to create awareness, bring about concerted action 
				through exchange of ideas, and propel others to come forth and 
				participate in this social cause.<br>
				<br>
				As the country’s first Environmental Awards, OGA has been 
				created to awaken the eco-consciousness in every citizen and 
				resident. The ultimate aim is to motivate behavioural change and 
				increase awareness in relation to the protection and 
				preservation of our environment.<br>
				<br>
				A large number of entries have been received, both from 
				companies and individuals, in all the eight categories and the 
				results will be announced at a grand function being held at 
				Shangri-La’s Barr Al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa on June 5.<br>
				<br>
				Speaking about the steady stream of entries, Ms Alpana Roy, 
				executive vice president, United Media Services (UMS), said, “As 
				a media house, UMS has a strength to get the ‘green message’ out 
				and we feel it’s our responsibility to make sure it’s the right 
				message. Therefore, as part of our corporate social 
				responsibility, we are delighted to be driving this national 
				platform to popularise the initiatives of companies and 
				achievements of individuals in Oman.”<br>
				<br>
				Going by the number of entries received from companies and 
				individuals for the OGA, it obviously means they understand the 
				role of businesses, institutions and individuals in 
				environmental protection and preservation through responsible 
				and sustainable consumption of natural resources.<br>
				<br>
				And the adoption of environmentally sound technologies, policies 
				and practices is a must to protect the natural resource that we 
				call our earth. The list of companies and organisations that are 
				championing Oman’s green cause are listed on the OGA website 
				www.oeronline.com/greenawards. Meanwhile, OGA’s Green Oman 
				Partners include Bahwan Engineering Company-Carrier; Voltamp; 
				Oman Oil Marketing Company; V-KOOL Oman; Shangri-La’s Barr Al 
				Jissah Resort &amp; Spa; MB Petroleum; Panasonic Ideas for Life.<br>
				<br>
				Oman Green Awards is being supported by the Ministry of 
				Environment and Climate Affairs, the Ministry of Health 
				(Department of Environmental and Occupational Health), Muscat 
				Municipality and the Environment Society of Oman. <br>
				<br>
				Oman Green Awards esteemed panel of judges include Ali Al Kiyumi, 
				Director General for Nature Conservation from Ministry of 
				Environment and Climate Affairs; Dr. Reginald Victor – Dean of 
				Research, Sultan Qaboos University; Dr. Salim Al Wahaibi – 
				Director of the Environmental and Occupational Health 
				Department, Ministry of Health; Mayank Singh, Group Editor, Oman 
				Economic Review and Environment Society of Oman<br>
				<br>
				The Support Partners are Majan Electricity, Oman Printers and 
				Stationers, Times of Oman, Al Shabiba; Business International 
				Group (BIG); Proscape Al Ansari; and Oil &amp; Gas Review.<br>
				<br>
				Speaking about their association with OGA, R Prabhakaran, 
				general manager, Oman Printers and Stationers, says that as a 
				responsible “corporate entity” and with the inherent belief that 
				the environment needs to be preserved, it is an imperative 
				responsibility of every institution to participate in some way 
				or the other in the first National Environment Awards in the 
				Sultanate. An initiative like OGA will raise environment 
				awareness in the Sultanate as it is a big leap in a mammoth 
				social responsibility and this is sure to spread the message and 
				every individual will feel the need to be a part of this 
				initiative.<br>
				<br>
				According to Ahmed bin Said Khamis Al Mazrouy, general manager 
				for Majan Electricity Company (MJEC), going green is a call for 
				survival of all living beings on earth and his company is part 
				of the earth’s ecological system. Mazrouy says the mission 
				statement of MJEC is to deliver a safe, reliable and economical 
				electrical supply to its customers.<br>
				<br>
				Furthermore, MJEC has the obligation to improve customer 
				awareness in conserving electricity use, and minimise system 
				energy loss, thereby reduce gas emission from fossil fuels, 
				Mazrouy added. Continuing further, Mazrouy says, “Our decision 
				to partner Oman Green Awards stems from the fact that it is the 
				first national environment awards in the Sultanate and we want 
				to show our commitment and contribution towards Oman and the 
				world in saving earth and we strongly believe and think that the 
				initiative like OGA will raise environment awareness in the 
				Sultanate.”<br>
				<br>
				Meanwhile, Hemant Pajankar, general manager of Business 
				International Group (BIG) mentions that by partnering with OGA, 
				his company wants to show that it cares for the protection of 
				Oman’s environment. “We encourage more companies to join in the 
				efforts being made by the UMS group for the ‘green’ cause which 
				is in line with His Majesty The Sultan’s vision for Oman,” 
				Pajankar says.<br>
				<br>
				Landscaping company Proscape Al Ansari is in the forefront of 
				environmental activities with its basic activity being 
				landscaping. Says Paul Thomas, manager Operations, “We are 
				instrumental in nurturing a love for plants, which is the vital 
				instrument in reducing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And 
				since OGA is the first national initiative for raising awareness 
				about the need to preserve the environment for the future 
				generations, we feel proud to be associated with OGA.”<br>

				towards society</b><br>
				Bahwan Engineering Company – Carrier has made environmental 
				stewardship a core part of its business strategy, says S K 
				Virmani, Managing Director, Bahwan Engineering Group. Excerpts 
				of an interview<br>
				<br>
				<b>The whole world is talking about going green to save the 
				environment. How important is ‘going green’ for BEC?</b><br>
				‘Going green’ is not a choice – it is a duty towards society at 
				large – it is about life on the planet! For us, sustainability 
				or ‘going green’ is not a buzzword. It is a comprehensive 
				framework whose three pillars – the environment, the economy and 
				society – are fully embedded into our daily activities. 
				Sustainability guides our policy-making, our operational 
				decisions, the way we source our materials, and how we execute 
				the projects. We are making the transition from 
				easy-to-implement green initiatives such as replacing light 
				bulbs, launching recycling programmes or choosing more energy 
				efficient technology to becoming a green company by making 
				environmental stewardship a core part of our business strategy. 
				This is done with the help of active commitment from company 
				leaders and a willingness to change the way we do business and 
				look at all projects and decisions with an eye towards the 
				environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How is BEC contributing to the cause of environment?</b><br>
				As an engineering construction company, we take pride in 
				involving ourselves in the nation-building projects, which are 
				environment friendly and promote sustainability. We feel that we 
				are participating in the efforts made by our clients like PDO, 
				Oman LNG, Qalhat LNG and Ministry of Health – Hospitals towards 
				sustainability and environment when we partner with them in 
				their various projects. Besides this, since the last three 
				decades, BEC supplies and maintains products, which are 
				environment friendly and consciously reduce carbon footprint. 
				Carrier developed the 30XA series air cooled screw chillers 
				operating on environmentally sound refrigerant R134a in the year 
				2005, which helps in reducing the power consumption, and hence 
				lowers the carbon footprint of buildings where these are 
				installed. BEC also promote Cummins Engines, which was the first 
				to certify to US EPA’s 2010 emissions standards, a full three 
				years ahead of schedule. Everything that Cummins does leads to a 
				cleaner, healthier and safer environment. Otis, the world’s 
				largest selling elevators and escalators sold by BEC, not only 
				make energy-saving products like Gen2 elevators, but also 
				manufacture them in a way that is kinder to the environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made you partner the Oman Green Awards?</b><br>
				To visibly demonstrate that ‘we care’. We care for the 
				environment we live in and want to fully pass on a better planet 
				to our future generation.<br>
				Do you think Oman Green Awards will raise environment awareness 
				in the Sultanate? <br>
				It has and of course, it will! The number of participants 
				registered speaks for itself. We wish that what is started as 
				‘Oman Green Awards’ should become a nationwide movement and 
				every common man in Oman should become a partner of this 
				movement which has always been a priority of His Majesty’s 
				Government.<br>

				power to transform</b><br>
				Alok Bhargava, CEO, Voltamp shares his views on the need for 
				energy efficient solutions and the company’s efforts in this 
				direction<br>
				<br>
				<b>The whole world is talking about going green to save the 
				environment. How important is ‘going green’ for your company?</b><br>
				‘Going green’ means being environmentally prudent. It is very 
				important to use energy resources more wisely and efficiently. 
				We would like to do our bit to support the cause in every 
				possible way and support the green cause. <br>
				<br>
				<b>How is your company contributing to the cause of environment?
				</b><br>
				Transformers are needed to transport electricity economically to 
				our homes and workplaces. They are designed to raise or lower 
				(i.e., transform) voltage to meet specific electrical needs. 
				Copper-intensive energy efficient transformers can be a very 
				smart decision for conserving precious energy resources and for 
				reducing industrial operating costs and losses in the 
				distribution networks of electric utilities. This is why, in 
				many parts of the world, government regulators are actively 
				promoting energy efficient transformers and industry is 
				discovering the financial benefits of owning them. <br>
				<br>
				When ‘standard’ transformers are used, a lot of energy is wasted 
				in the form of heat. Energy efficient transformers substantially 
				reduce the amount of this wasted energy. Energy efficient 
				transformers rely on high conductivity copper windings. As a 
				general rule, the electrical energy efficiency rating of a 
				transformer increases as the amount of copper is increased. This 
				means that copper, and more of it, enables transformers to run 
				cooler with higher overload capacities – and therefore to run 
				more efficiently. Also, cooler-running energy efficient 
				transformers are expected to have a longer service life. We’ve 
				partnered with the International Copper Association to help you 
				find more ways to save energy and reduce the carbon footprint in 
				the World. Voltamp is in the process of optimising their designs 
				further and is working with utility companies for improving the 
				technical specifications for more energy efficient transformers.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made you partner the Oman Green Awards, the first 
				National Environment Awards in the Sultanate? </b><br>
				Voltamp is a talent centric company and a prominent brand name 
				in the field of electricals in the Sultanate of Oman and as a 
				company we impact the environment largely. Also we are largely 
				dependent on natural resource for its raw materials – Copper, 
				CRGO and Oil. Voltamp Energy is committed to reducing the carbon 
				footprint in Oman. And that’s the reason why we are supporting 
				Oman Green Awards.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that the initiative like Oman Green Awards will 
				raise environment awareness in the Sultanate? <br>

				Alaa M Jarrar, General Manager, V-Kool shares his views on the 
				importance of preserving the environment and Oman Green Awards 
				with OER<br>
				<br>
				<b>The whole world is talking about going green to save the 
				environment. How important is ‘going green’ for your company?</b><br>
				V-KOOL products have been recognised globally as leaders in 
				providing daylight harvesting and energy efficient solutions 
				through advanced thin film coatings for architectural and 
				automotive glass. To-date, 18 million car owners in close to 30 
				countries are enjoying the benefits of up to 94 per cent heat 
				rejection and reducing 2.38 million tonnes of CO2 emission with 
				V-KOOL. Going green for our company will initially help to raise 
				the awareness and get the attention of people about climate 
				change and global warming, which is caused by the increase of 
				CO2 level in the atmosphere. Moreover, going green will help us 
				to improve our business because people have to think about the 
				environment when they purchase any product. Their needs should 
				focus on how they can reduce air pollution and save energy. <br>
				<br>
				<b>How is your company contributing to the cause of environment?
				</b><br>
				The advanced smart coating of V-KOOL can make the one-inch thick 
				glass to possess the same isolative capability of a six-inch 
				thick wall. This attribute helps in reducing the amount of power 
				required to cool a car or house – thus reducing carbon emissions 
				significantly. By selectively rejecting solar heat and reducing 
				air conditioning loads, V-KOOL improves the fuel efficiency of a 
				typical car by three per cent. This can be translated to a 132 
				kg reduction in carbon emissions every year. More than 18 
				million cars worldwide are incorporated with V-KOOL technology, 
				and we are proud to be accountable for reducing 238 million 
				tonnes of CO2 annually and 198 million trees are absorbing this 
				quantity of carbon dioxide during one whole year.<br>
				<br>
				The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded V-KOOL 
				with the prestigious Energy Star Buildings Ally. This highly 
				exclusive marquee is awarded to technologies that make a 
				significant contribution in reducing energy consumption at a 
				global level and thereby reducing air pollution and emissions. 
				V-KOOL has since helped numerous corporations and buildings 
				around the world in being more energy efficient. V-KOOL 
				technology has been voted as one of the Top 100 Inventions of 
				the Millennium by Popular Science Magazine.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made your partner the Oman Green Awards, the first 
				National Environment Awards in the Sultanate? </b><br>
				We have seen many initiatives and campaigns to raise the 
				awareness for the environment care, but in my opinion Oman Green 
				Awards will be the strongest campaign till now which will have a 
				very positive impact at the national level towards directing 
				people’s attention for environment protection and energy 
				savings.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that the initiative like Oman Green Awards will 
				raise environment awareness in the Sultanate? </b><br>
				I am sure that if everyone thinks the same way as the organisers 
				of Oman Green Awards, then the awareness about the solutions for 
				reducing the danger of environment pollution will spread very 
				fast. And I hope it will be the responsibility of every person 
				to think of earth whenever we take any step in life. <br>

				Oman makes common sense Raising green awareness is like raising 
				your children – it is a continuous process says Mohammed Al 
				Kharusi, Director HR &amp; IT, MB Holding Company while talking 
				about Oman Green Awards<br>
				<br>
				<b>The whole world is talking about going green to save the 
				environment. How important is ‘going green’ for your company?</b><br>
				“Going Green” is important for our MB Holding Group of companies 
				– MB Petroleum Services, Petrogas, United Engineering Services 
				and Mawarid Mining. Care for the environment translates into 
				good health for our staff and stakeholders, long-term 
				sustainability for mother earth and ultimately makes good 
				business sense. Oman is mainly an arid country and as such 
				conservation of water, which is the main source of greening 
				Oman, will be essential if we are to succeed and survive the 
				next centuries given the growth in population and 
				industrialisation. We have to be part of the society, which 
				raises awareness to protect our environment and livelihood. It 
				is our corporate and social responsibility to do so.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How is your company contributing to the cause of environment?</b><br>
				We contribute by raising our staff’s awareness for the need to 
				protect, preserve and nurture the environment. We conduct 
				environmental impact assessments in all our projects, which 
				might have an impact on the environment whether it is liners for 
				the pit dams in mining or in our oil operations or in waste 
				disposal. Our slogans under the “We care” promotion in our 
				communications for corporate Social Responsibility are – ‘We 
				care for our human assets’, ‘We care for our society’, ‘We care 
				for the Green cause’ and ‘We care for our people’. Our risk 
				management processes also help us minimise risks in what we do 
				and increase sustainability.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made your partner the Oman Green Awards?</b><br>
				We have partnered with the Oman Green awards because of its 
				originality and conviction that we need to change organisations’ 
				and people’s behaviours towards the environment. This is coupled 
				with the partnership it has in relevant government ministries, 
				the municipality and the Environment Society of Oman, which have 
				individuals who know what they are talking about and have the 
				authority and desire to make Oman Green and ultimately a healthy 
				work place for its people. It is also a way of contributing to 
				the global village by influencing the greening of Oman thus 
				reducing carbon emissions and conservation of our natural 
				resources.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that Oman Green Awards will raise environment 
				awareness? </b><br>
				Yes. It is a first initiative and as such it will be a pioneer 
				but I believe we have a good chance of raising awareness. We 
				will need to learn from the response of the organisations and 
				its people. It is a good start and we know that change does not 
				happen overnight. It will need continuous communication, 
				engagement and feedback to really make a difference. If we can 
				convert organisations then they will be able to raise awareness 
				of its staff, families of such staff and friends of families 
				thus spreading the message that Greening Oman makes common sense 
				and is pleasant to the eyes and that protection of our 
				environment is a must and not a wish.<br>

				<b>How is Oman Oil contributing to the cause of environment?</b><br>
				Over the years, our company has initiated various measures in an 
				effort to do our best to protect the environment. All our 
				company road tankers are made of aluminium rather than steel. 
				While it is more expensive, aluminium road tankers are 
				friendlier to the environment as they minimise carbon emissions 
				and use less fuel. We also use a recycling system at all our car 
				wash facilities. We have recently also improved construction 
				specifications for our forecourt flooring to include concrete 
				hard stands around the pump islands at our retail sites. For 
				more than 10 years, we have been considered as leaders in 
				implementing non-metallic double skin pipes and double skin 
				retail underground tanks with leak detection system in all our 
				filling stations. This is a preventive measure against 
				pollution. Additionally our company actively participates in air 
				quality monitoring at the Mina Al Fahal Area along with all 
				players in the area in collaboration with MECA.<br>
				<br>
				Promoting an environmentally friendly culture within our head 
				office has also taken centre-stage. Recently, we installed 
				recycling boxes in all our offices and we also began 
				distributing our quarterly newsletter electronically to reduce 
				usage of paper. OOMCO has an HSSE division headed by a senior 
				manager who sets HSSE standards and procedures and overlooks the 
				company’s adherence to this.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made your partner the Oman Green Awards, the first 
				National Environment Awards in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				We are happy to collaborate with such initiatives especially 
				given that Oman Green Awards is the first of its kind in the 
				country. Thus, hand in hand with OOMCO’s policies and procedures 
				that gives commitment and objectives, we have always believed in 
				the education and the development of the public. This is an 
				excellent platform to kick off such an important education to 
				the public and we are proud to be a part of it.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that and initiative like Oman Green Awards will 
				raise environment awareness in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				Definitely! I believe that with such strong collaborations from 
				the Ministry of Environment, Environment Society of Oman and 
				United Media Services the campaign will do a great job. Also 
				given that the campaign runs for a period of one year there is 
				ample time to communicate messages to the public.<br>

				in green innovation</b><br>
				As Panasonic – Ideas for Life is the ‘Green Oman Partner for OGA, 
				officials of OMASCO – George Alexander, Divisional Manager, 
				Consumer Electronics; and Michael Hansen, Managing Director 
				speak about their association with this unique event<br>
				<br>
				<b>The whole world is talking about going green to save the 
				environment. How important is ‘going green’ for your company?</b><br>
				For Panasonic, this has become the soul mantra. Panasonic has 
				already declared that it wants to be the No. 1 green innovation 
				company in the electronics industry and all innovations in the 
				business activities are based on environment. The dream is to 
				create every house with zero carbon dioxide emissions. 
				Panasonic, as part of its corporate culture promotes all 
				business based on the environment only.<br>
				<br>
				In fact in a research done in GCC countries, 80 per cent of the 
				people were eco-conscious and 56 per cent of them rated 
				Panasonic as the No. 1 company which contributes to Green 
				movement and to environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How is Panasonic contributing to the cause of environment?</b><br>
				Panasonic had started environment-friendly products many years 
				back. All its products have been developed keeping the 
				environment as the major consideration. The television 
				manufacturing does not contain any lead or phosphorus and uses 
				very little energy during operation; the air conditioners are 
				designed to save energy; the washing machines are designed to 
				save water; the LED lighting has practically no emissions, the 
				list is endless. Panasonic has developed the concept, which is 
				called as ‘Link for Greener Living’ based on the three 
				parameters of create, store and save.<br>
				<br>
				The management slogan for Panasonic is “Unite Our Efforts – 
				Drive Eco Innovation”.<br>
				<br>
				Omasco is setting up a interactive display at its flagship store 
				in Qurum and customers can get a great insight into the entire 
				Green Movement as well as create a thirst for eco-knowledge 
				through an interactive panel which will be fun learning.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made your partner the Oman Green Awards, the first 
				National Environment Awards in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				Panasonic is synonymous with green innovations across the globe 
				and has been involved in various green activities in many 
				countries. As the local partner of Panasonic, Omasco want to 
				contribute to a green Oman through Panasonic products and its 
				new green innovations. OGA would provide the platform for the 
				citizens of Oman to become aware of the need to become soldiers 
				in the green movement which is sweeping across the globe and 
				Omasco, through Panasonic would like to contribute to a better 
				tomorrow for the next generation through the green environment 
				movement of today.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that the initiative like Oman Green Awards will 
				raise environment awareness in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				All countries needs to start somewhere for the green movement to 
				catch the imagination and make people aware of the need to 
				become environment conscious. OGA would not only strive to start 
				this, but also recognise the individuals and companies who with 
				their activities have been doing their bit towards the Green 
				movement.<br>

				of environmental activity</b><br>
				Three initiatives distinguish the green activities of 
				Shangri-La’s Barr Al Jissah Resort and Spa namely, 
				sustainability, embrace and sanctuary, says Kate Jones, Director 
				of Communications in this interview<br>
				<br>
				<b>The whole world is talking about going green to save the 
				environment. How important is ‘going green’ for your company?</b><br>
				As a group, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts is encouraging all its 
				hotels to implement green activities within the scope of their 
				CSR programmes. In particular, the group has established three 
				initiatives that all hotels must subscribe to – sustainability, 
				embrace and sanctuary.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How is Shangri-La’s Barr Al Jissah Resort and Spa 
				contributing to the cause of environment?</b><br>
				Following on from the above answer, ‘Sustainability’ relates to 
				the hotel becoming ISO 14001 certified – the first hotel in Oman 
				and we have laid the foundation to ensure that Barr Al Jissah 
				can continue to operate without having an adverse affect on the 
				local environment.<br>
				<br>
				Our Turtle Care Project relates to ‘Sanctuary’ – although 
				turtles have been visiting these beaches for tens of thousands 
				of years, we must provide a sanctuary for them to ensure their 
				long-term survival as a species. By championing these 
				initiatives, we are able to spread the green message to the 
				local people – we can ‘Embrace’ all others that come into 
				contact with the hotel - of course employees and their families, 
				but also suppliers <br>
				and stakeholders.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made your partner the Oman Green Awards, the first 
				National Environment Awards in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				Green initiatives have been part of the hotel’s activities since 
				the opening in 2006 and we are delighted to be given the 
				opportunity to share our experiences with the rest of Oman. We 
				can also learn from other organisations with more experience in 
				Oman than ourselves.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that the initiative like Oman Green Awards will 
				raise environment awareness in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				Certainly. The general public will be able to learn more about 
				green initiatives taking place in Oman. However, in order for 
				them to make their own contribution to the environment, we must 
				find a way to relate it to their own personal lives. We must 
				ensure that amongst the initiatives being showcased, there are 
				those that are relevant to the general public and <br>
				our daily lifestyles.<br>

				of the green cause</b><br>
				As the leading media house in the country, Muscat Press and 
				Publishing House has contributed its mite to protect Oman’s 
				environment in a big way and partnering OGA is part of this 
				commitment, says its CEO Ahmed Essa Al Zadjali<br>
				<br>
				<b>The whole world is talking about going green to save the 
				environment. How important is ‘going green’ for your company?</b><br>
				The Muscat Printing and Publishing House (MPPH) has always been 
				in tune with the times. And, protection of environment is the 
				need of the hour. We have been advocating the need for 
				protection of environment through our publications. Given the 
				reach and penetration of our media in the society, we have been 
				able to bring like-minded people together and inspire them about 
				protecting the environment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How is your company contributing to the cause of environment?</b><br>
				Being the leading media house in the country, MPPH has 
				shouldered the responsibility of protecting the environment in a 
				big way. In our office, we have been relentlessly making efforts 
				to prevent wastage of paper by finding ways and means of 
				reducing its use even for our routine work. Out efforts in 
				cutting down on the use of ink has been our contribution to 
				protect the environment.<br>
				<br>
				We have been emphasising on cutting down chemicals’ use in the 
				form of ink. <br>
				<br>
				Printouts are the most ‘abused’ form of wastage in newspaper 
				office, but on this front, we have been cautious, and have been 
				working out various ways and means to promote the use of 
				computers in our day-to-day office work. For instance; sub 
				editors, and the reporters have been told not print pages unless 
				and until it is necessary to do so, instead, they have been 
				asked to learn methods that would discourage taking printouts 
				and resorting to use of computers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made you partner the Oman Green Awards (OGA), the first 
				National Environment Awards in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				As an emerging country on every front, I see that Oman can play 
				a vital role in the protection of environment at an 
				international-level. The example of which was seen at Copenhagen 
				Climate Summit, wherein, Oman had sent its representatives to 
				show its concern for environment protection. Our commitment and 
				resolve to do our bit in the field has been the driving force 
				for us to partner OGA.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that the initiative like OGA will raise 
				environment awareness in the Sultanate?</b><br>
				As a journalist it is my firm resolve that media plays a vital 
				role in creating awareness about environment, and the initiative 
				of OGA is one of these endeavours, which would go a long way in 
				creating awareness among the masses about the significance of 
				environment. The effort on part of OGA of roping in people from 
				different parts of life is commendable. OGA I feel would be an 
				ideal platform recognising the contribution of the people of 
				Oman for protecting the environment. <br>

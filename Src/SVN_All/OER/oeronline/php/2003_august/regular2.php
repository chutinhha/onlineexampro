            <br>
            <img border="0" src="oil.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175" height="135">Three months ago the world's oil analysts were forecasting a rapid fall in oil prices. The theory went that post-war Iraq would claim its rightful place as a major oil producer, flood the market with cheap crude and send prices crashing on the International Petroleum Exchange and NYMEX. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would drown in the flood.&nbsp;<br>
 So much for theory: Brent Crude peaked at $28.90 per barrel on July 18. This despite the fact that OPEC production quotas were at their highest level for years. The cartel appears stronger than ever, manipulating oil markets to the top end of its US$22 - US$28 per barrel target price range. At its last meeting, on June 11, OPEC simply rolled over its generous quotas.&nbsp;<br>
 This forecasting failure throws up a number of probing questions. First, why did the analysts get it so wrong? Second - and far more important - will they eventually be proved
            right?<br>
            The first question is the easiest to answer. "The global oil environment remained one of potential shortage, as it was before the Iraq war, rather than potential surpluses, as predicted in the pre-war world," says a recent report by the Economist Intelligence Unit
            (EIU). "Prices have held up, inflated by a combination of Saudi Arabian production restraint, the slow return of Iraqi post-war return of Iraqi crude oil supplies has largely failed to materialise in the months of the war Looting has hindered Iraq's short-term production
            capacity.<br>
            On the second question, analysts at the EIU are confident that forecasts of an Iraq-inspired supply glut will come true - and sooner rather than later. Yes, there have been unforeseen delays in ramping Iraqi production up to pre-war levels, but these are temporary blips that will soon be ironed out. The EIU estimates that Iraqi production averaged 660,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2003, but that output will rise sharply to 1.5 million barrels in the third quarter and 2.1 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter.<br>
            "Important questions will emerge as Iraq slowly returns to the market in the second half of 2003 particularly as any growth in oil demand is forecast to remain relatively subdued," says the
            EIU. "Under our baseline scenario as Iraqi oil returns and pushes the market into heavy surplus, OPEC will be forced to take drastic supply-cutting action." This will fail, driving Brent Crude down to US$21.42 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this
            year.<br>
            What about 2004? The EIU sees the situation playing out like this: OPEC's initial efforts to restrain supplies in 2004 are destined to fail, as too many key producers will cheat on their existing quotas. However, this cheating will push the global oil market further into surplus in the second quarter of 2004, with an average daily surplus of more than three million barrels, driving the average second-quarter price of Brent Blend to US$16.14 per barrel.<br>
            "An oil price of US$15 per barrel would be catastrophic for most oil-producing nations, and this will force OPEC to make a determined effort to regain control of the market," says the
            EIU. "Hence, we are assuming that OPEC will pull out all the stops to wrestle back control of the market in the third-quarter of 2004, sharply curtailing supplies, probably in coalition with key non-OPEC oil exporters such as Mexico, Russia and Norway."<br>
            What does this mean for Gulf economies? Ultimately, 2003 will be a good year - the fourth in succession - with oil averaging mid-US$20 per barrel prices. But the party will end next year, with Brent Crude averaging below US$20 per barrel (The EIU forecast an average price of US$18.31 per barrel) for the first time since
            1998.<br>
            This is hardly encouraging news for Saudi Arabia, still the world's number one oil exporter despite the recent rise of Russia. Economists agree that Saudi Arabia needs an average oil price of around US$22 per barrel to break even - anything less and the government will have to start slashing public spending, as it did (albeit temporarily) when prices briefly crashed in the aftermath of September
            11.<br>
            However, there is one crumb of comfort for the Kingdom. In mid-July, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf won a gas development deal covering 200,000 square km in the southern part of the vast Empty Quarter desert. The agreement is a scaled down version of the US$5 billion Shaybah project that Anglo-Dutch Shell and its French partner Total have been negotiating for over five
            years.<br>
            Crucially, it comes just weeks after talks between Saudi Arabia and US energy major Exxon Mobil over a proposed US$15 billion gas deal which ended in failure. The collapse of that deal was a major blow to Saudi Arabia's attempts to style itself as a modernising country keen to attract foreign direct investment. The fact that it has so quickly signed up the world's number two and number four energy majors is a real coup for the Kingdom, even though the deal is relatively modest in size, valued at around US$2 billion by analysts. Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi described the news as an important step and strong beginning the area of global investment in the gas exploration and production operations in the Kingdom." It may not offset the looming impact of oil at US$16 per barrel, but it's better than nothing.

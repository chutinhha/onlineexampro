        investment landscape</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><br>
        <b>A new law implemented by Dubai is giving a greater stability to the 
        real estate market</b><br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The real estate boom in the Gulf and the wider Middle East is often 
        described, even defined, by the buildings it produces: the tallest, the 
        most technologically advanced, or the development with the biggest price 
        tag.<br>
        <br>
        But new structures are appearing on the landscape and they are arguably 
        causing greater excitement in the investment community. These structures 
        are legal and could spur investment activity in the region.<br>
        <br>
        Having pioneered freehold development in the region, Dubai is once again 
        taking a lead with the passing of Law No 8, a prosaically named law that 
        is regarded by many as critical to the maturing market.<br>
        <br>
        The creation of trust accounts (escrow accounts) means that from now on 
        investors buying property “off plan” will make their payments into 
        special accounts managed by major banks and supervised by the Dubai 
        Lands Department. Developers will then have to fulfil a number of 
        conditions in terms of construction progress before they can access the 
        buyer’s money. It ends potential buyers nightmare that a rogue developer 
        might make off with their money before completing construction.<br>
        <br>
        The new law is seen as a key move to give the market greater stability 
        and many in the industry feel it will provide a major boost to investor 
        confidence, even to the point of inducing institutional investors to 
        re-look at Dubai and the region.<br>
        <br>
        “I believe that the market will see a new wave of investors in the real 
        estate sector, with a completely different demographic profile from 
        buyers who have been investing in the Emirate for the last five years, 
        which was when Dubai opened up the property market to foreigners,” said 
        Mehdi Amjad, President and Chief Executive of Omniyat Holdings and 
        Omniyat Properties.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc1.jpg" width="250" height="281" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">He said that the new law would lead to more transparency and confidence 
        in the market. “We are very happy with this new law because it’s 
        positive for serious developer.”<br>
        <br>
        Amjad said that institutional investors had so far been reluctant to 
        invest in off-plan developments because of the lack of measures to 
        protect their investments, something the new law aims at achieving. 
        “This is a natural progression for the Dubai market and will ensure its 
        continuity.”<br>
        <br>
        Amjad also praised the way that the law was structured after an 
        extensive consultation process between the government, major developers 
        and banks that will take part in the scheme. In fact, Omniyat alone was 
        in discussion with the Dubai Lands Department for six months.<br>
        <br>
        “The law was structured in a very clever and efficient way, so that 
        rather than having control by the government, causing more pressure on 
        the land department, they have networked reputable banks to work with 
        the developers,” he said. “This is very efficient and another innovation 
        by the government of Dubai, which wants to reduce bureaucracy and red 
        tape.”<br>
        <br>
        Under the new scheme, developers simply need to go to the Dubai Lands 
        Department and register a new property. The department will then issue 
        instructions to the four approved banks to open a trust account in the 
        name of the project. Prospective buyers will make their payments into 
        such accounts rather than to developer.<br>
        <br>
        The new law was enacted even as the Dubai Lands Department was being re-organised 
        to enable it to better cope with the large number of freehold property 
        registrations together with changes in the Emirate’s regulatory 
        framework. A new unit, the Real Estate Regulatory Agency, was 
        established to oversee regulations, including trust accounts, new laws 
        covering real estate brokers and planned new regulations on home owners’ 
        associations.<br>
        <br>
        Dubai is not alone in re-organising legislations relating to the real 
        estate sector. In Abu Dhabi too, the government is reviewing its laws, 
        with a view to clarifying key issues relating to home ownership among 
        UAE nationals and foreigners.<br>
        <br>
        Developers have also been contributing to a more investor-friendly 
        environment. Emaar, for instance, has almost eliminated a controversial 
        charge paid by homeowners’ when they want to sell their property. 
        Accordingly, it has reduced the charge for a Notification of Completion 
        certificate by 90 per cent, from Dhs5,000 to Dhs500. This followed an 
        earlier move by competitor Nakheel to halve the cost of such 
        certificates, from Dhs1,000.<br>
        <br>
        The regulatory moves are welcome in a region where the figures for real 
        estate development continue to impress and are projected to continue 
        doing so until the end of the decade, according to the Middle East 
        Economic Digest. Says the Digest:</font></p>

        real estate models that have worked well in the Gulf to these markets.<br>
        <br>In terms of pure investment, Arab investors could spend as much as US$20 
        billion on real estate worldwide in 2007, according to Jones Lang 
        LaSalle. This represents a 60 per cent increase on the US$13 billion 
        they spent in 2006. The prime destinations for that money were the US, 
        UK, South Africa and Germany.<br><br>Similarly, Hedge Fund Research estimates that the amount of Middle 
        Eastern capital available for investment is a staggering US$4.1 
        trillion, making the region one of the most valuable in terms of 
        investment capital.<br><br>On a wider front, global asset management group Merrill Lynch has noted 
        a renewed trend towards investment in real estate worldwide. In its 
        World Wealth Report, it says the trend was away from assets such as 
        hedge funds, derivatives, commodities and private equity.<br><br>The report, covering the assets of the world’s wealthy elite, identified 
        the UAE as having 68,100 millionaires, up 9,100 on the previous year. In

        of high net worth individuals was put at 9.5 million, up 8.3 per cent on 
        year. Ultra high net worth individuals (those with US$30 million or more 
        in liquid assets) rose by 11.3 per cent to 94,970. The combined assets 
        of the “millionaire class” were put at US$37.2 trillion.<br><br>The man once called “the best real estate investor in the world” has 
        given his stamp of approval on the regional market. Expressing a degree 
        of disillusionment with the market in the US, billionaire Thomas J. 
        Barrack says: “To find true growth areas, you have to look East, from 
        Dubai to Shanghai – the future is there.”<br><br>The UAE’s leadership role in the region’s real estate market has also 
        been acknowledged by a Johns Hopkins University study, which says: “One 
        initial thought can be presented: the UAE is the first country in the 
        world to perform major urban transformations in the 21st century and it 
        poses a great opportunity for investors willing to generate a new 
        pattern of real estate investments in the world.”</font></p>

        <img border="0" src="gcc3.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Listed Kuwaiti firms slammed 
        the Arab state’s stock market, calling on the government and parliament 
        to stop what they called rule changes that would encourage firms to flee 
        abroad. Almost a quarter of the firms listed on the second-largest Arab 
        exchange criticised the new rules that would halt trading in listed 
        companies that buy into or sell out to firms it had previously turned 
        down for listing. The new rule is the latest in a series of changes 
        aimed at improving transparency and shareholder rights on the stock 
        market. Exchange Director Saleh al-Falah has rejected the criticism, 
        saying the new rules were aimed at protecting investors, particularly 
        small shareholders. But stepping up pressure on the exchange, the 43 
        listed firms have accused it of going beyond its mandate by taking 
        decisions that they said broke the law, and would force firms to flee 
        Kuwait and deter foreign investment.<br>
        <br>
        “It needs the intervention of the executive and legislative powers... to 
        stop the overstepping of boundaries by the exchange in order to protect 
        Kuwait’s reputation and interests,” the companies said in page-long 
        advertisement published in the local press. The exchange had sparked 
        criticism from executives and analysts earlier this year when it said it 
        would halt trading for a year in companies that had more than quadrupled 
        their share capital. Executives have also described the listing rules as 
        too tough.<br>

        per cent over 2005, according to the latest report of the United Nations 
        Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).<br>
        <br>
        The report attributed the increase to the region’s strong economic 
        growth and improved business climate and to high oil prices, which have 
        attracted increasing amounts of FDI to oil, gas and related industries 
        as well as to telecom, tourism and financial services.<br>
        <br>
        The unprecedented increase in FDI came after Saudi Arabia took a series 
        of measures to attract foreign investment. The country’s Supreme 
        Economic Council (SEC) revised the negative list last March, allowing 
        foreign investment in vital sectors like insurance services, wholesale 
        and retail trade, air and train transport, and communication services.<br>

        Asia surged by 44 per cent in 2006 to an unprecedented US$60 billion. 
        Turkey topped the list with US$20 billion, a 100 per cent increase over 
        2005, Saudi Arabia second with US$18 billion and the UAE third with US$8 
        billion, with a 23 per cent decline in inflows or US$8 billion. Jordan

        FDI outflows from West Asia totalled US$14 billion, an increase of 5 per 
        cent over the 2005 level. The value of cross-border mergers and 
        acquisitions (M&amp;As) by investors from West Asia increased by 78 per 
        cent, amounting to US$32 billion, as a result of high oil prices and the 
        current account surpluses of oil-producing countries. About two-thirds 
        of those M&amp;As were targeted at developed countries, in particular the 
        United Kingdom (35 per cent by value), Canada (11 per cent) and the 
        United States (9 per cent). Kuwait accounted for more than half of the 
        region’s total outward FDI, mainly in the telecommunications industry.</font></p>

        in Saudi Arabia, according to Science Daily. Various theories have been 
        put forward to explain the numerous deaths. Analyses are being conducted 
        to confirm or rule out the hypothesis of food intoxication. Poisoning 
        caused by the ingestion of toxic plants, mycotoxins (microscopic fungi), 
        or mineral deficiencies have also been suggested. The deaths are 
        probably due to a multitude of factors, which have a detrimental effect 
        on the immune system, including some viruses which could increase the 
        severity of infections or parasitic infestations in animals.</font></p>

        The World Economic Forum has released its latest scenario study – The 
        Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the World: Scenarios to 2025, a set of 
        scenarios looking at three possible and plausible futures for Saudi 
        Arabia. These scenarios examine potential shifts across economic, 
        environmental, social, political and technological spheres and offer 
        challenging visions designed to test strategy, open up dialogue, and 
        offer insight into important factors affecting Saudi Arabia and the 
        broader region between today and 2025.<br>
        <br>
        The scenarios analyse medium- and long-term risks and development 
        opportunities for Saudi Arabia and emphasise the importance of 
        transparency, regional relationships and shifting social factors among 
        the forces that will impact the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the year 
        2025.<br>
        <br>
        To further explore the deeper issues and ramifications of the region’s 
        development, the World Economic Forum will take the results of The 
        Kingdom of Saudi Arabia &amp; the World: Scenarios to 2025 to the World 
        Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2008 in January, to be held in Davos.

        <img border="0" src="gcc13.jpg" width="175" height="124" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Saudi Arabia has banned the latest issue of the Arabic-language edition 
        of Forbes magazine for an article about the wealth of the king and other 
        Arab leaders. Reuters reported the news attributing it to Forbes 
        managing editor.<br>
        <br>
        “The reason was a two-page report on the wealth of 15 ruling dynasties, 
        seven of which are Arab,” Refaat Jaafar, managing editor of Dubai-based 
        Forbes Arabia, told Reuters. “This sort of ban is counterproductive.”<br>
        <br>
        “Instead of ripping out the pages of the report, the authorities decided 
        to ban the magazine altogether,” said one government official, speaking 
        on condition of anonymity, to Reuters. The report ranked King Abdullah 
        third, behind the rulers of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. </font></p>

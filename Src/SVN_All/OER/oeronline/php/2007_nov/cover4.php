<img border="0" src="cover6.jpg" width="98" height="120" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">How do you control prices? For me, except for Saudi Arabia, which fixes prices 
at the port level, none of the other governments do. So, when you talk about 
free market pricing and you talk about key trade agreements being signed, there 
is no way you can control prices. <br><br>In the current situation, when the economy is doing pretty well and the spending 
power had increased significantly, obviously the demand will be significantly 
higher. So there is no way that you can control inflation. Yes, you can control 
the inflation through rent-sealing measures, etc. Other than that, you can’t do 
anything with the other sectors because internationally the commodity prices 
have increased. So everybody will justify in terms of price rise in retail 
segment. So, it is a pass through from all ends. Take bread for that matter. 
None of the flour producers/bakers can bear the costs because it has increased 
by 70 to 80 per cent. It has to be passed to the customer as no baker will bear 
the cost and the government can’t do anything. They can’t even give subsidies 
because of all these trade agreements.<br><br>The CBO chief also says that it is a passing phase. Now that there is 15 per 
cent cap on rents and a couple of other things, they reckon that they will be 
able to rein in the price level. By taking care of these two, do you really 
reckon that they will be able to avoid revaluing the RO-USD parity?<br>
<br>So, from the economic point of view, if you ask me it is very difficult to 
manage the current volatile scenario. If you ask me politically, probably they 
know much better and it will be difficult for them to do it. The other aspect is 
that you have a trade situation where trade is dollar-denominated. And even 
though dollar pricing has been done, the countries that are exporting goods to 
Oman have experienced a significant appreciation of their respective currencies. 
With this sort of trade structure, you will import inflation. And this is beyond 
control. So eventually your currency is depreciating because of your peg with 
the US Dollar. Further, if you are not going to adjust your interest rates 
(which is the case with Oman), then you ultimately revalue. Trying to stick 
around with the existing USD-RO parity cannot be people friendly.<br><br><b>Upswing for US Dollar?</b><br>The situation that we are facing today is unusual. We have not seen it in our 
history. The entire trade balance has shifted. Previously, we were all dependent 
on the US and western economies, which were major consumers and the rest of the 
nations were supplying. People are expecting that we are going to see a cycle in 
which there is a possibility of recession in the US – a prolonged one at that. 
That is the reason why even the Fed has reacted much more than the market 
expected. The market expected only a 25 basis points reduction. Instead, the Fed 
Reserve went for a 50 basis points cut. So, obviously they are concerned about 
the credit problem; also about the economic cycle turning negative. So, with 
this entire situation, obviously we are not seeing a turnaround, or probably we 
are seeing a sharper slide. We are going to see a further cut in the interest 
rates. If it sustains US growth, it is fine. But if there is going to be a 
negative trend starting from this quarter onwards, then the US is heading for 
trouble. If the Dollar goes down, the interest rates will go further down. May 
be it will go down to say: 3.5 per cent, a level at which the US Dollar is going 
to get a further beating – may be see another 5-6 per cent depreciation!<br><br>Can the Omani Rial take such depreciation in the US Dollar? What will be the 
exchange rate at that point in time, if the RO takes that? No doubt, these 
people are trying to keep oil prices higher; OPEC is trying to play by just 
giving political statements. Of course, supply has not dropped. So. today’s 
US$80 is equivalent to US$68 in real terms because of the depreciation of 
currency. So, effectively, you are not gaining on it. Obviously, revaluation has 
to be considered. <br><br><b>Policy Issues<br></b>I am clueless as to what the Central Bank of Oman can do. The region just 
follows what the US does in terms of monetary policy actions. They have not 
developed an expertise for that. <br><br>Again next month, if there is going to be a further slash in the rates by Fed, 
can we once again say ‘sorry, that ours is a different economy, you cut the 
interest rate and we will not do it’. We will have to do it. What Kuwait did, 
was fine. The only bold step it had taken was to change its currency basket 
instead of relying solely on the US Dollar. That is the big step towards having 
your own monetary policy. Take Kuwait’s case. Around 60 per cent is US Dollar 
rate and the rest is mixed, which is a realistic scenario. Today, 40 per cent 
currencies of the goods imported are from non-Dollar based locations and the 
rest is US Dollar linked. So you are balancing it. Once you balance it, then you 
do not have a problem on the external front. In the global scenario, you can 
still be competitive. Going forward, you can also control inflation.<br><br><b>Reserves Conundrum</b><br>Let us get down to basics. Now, in terms of exports earnings, it is all in US 
Dollars. Now, all Dollars are parked in Dollar-denominated assets. All reserves 
and balance sheets are awash with Dollars. If they start doing things such as 
depreciating or revaluing, then it will impact them significantly on the 
reserves front, which can be a disaster. <br><br>Kuwait is slowly moving into different currencies. None of the other governments 
have done this so far, which clearly shows that they do not have an inclination 
of changing the peg. They have not experienced it before. This is probably the 
first cycle in which they are experiencing such a contrasting situation, by 
which you see the USD going down and your economy is prospering. And you want to 
sustain your economy, but the US is dragging you down. They have been supplying 
oil to the US in huge quantities for a long time. Due to a possible slowdown, if 
US were to buy less, it will impact the oil exporting Gulf countries. 
Surprisingly, today suppliers are going to Asia. So your export revenue is 
coming as usual despite the US slowing down. This is a unique situation, which 
they have not experienced so far. They have to come out with innovative 
solutions. </font></p>

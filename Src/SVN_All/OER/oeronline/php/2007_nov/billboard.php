        strong suction power and does its job without noise to sustain a clean

        and allergens are absorbed by the cleaner. This apart , the vacuum 
        cleaner boasts of features like a lifetime washable filter that is easy 
        to maintain and does not need to be replaced. For reducing the cleaning 
        time, the auto mode can actually measure the dust quantity and control 
        the suction power accordingly. As an improvisation on conventional 
        vacuum cleaners, the pre-filters do not clog easily, bringing down the 
        motor load to prolong the life of the cleaner. Power can be controlled 
        by an infrared handle device without having to stoop low. The Saxon 
        Laboratory group (SLG) has certified this H-83 series of Samsung 
        cleaners with the ‘Excellent’ (5 Star) level of dust retaining, anti

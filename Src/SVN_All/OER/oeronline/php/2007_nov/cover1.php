events, writes Matein Khalid<br></b><br>
<img border="0" src="cover3.jpg" width="98" height="120" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Foreign exchange markets in the Gulf are on the edge after a succession of 
events have escalated the risks of imminent, seismic changes in the Gulf’s 
currency peg regimes. One, Kuwait abandoned its four-year dinar peg to the 
dollar in May 2007, moving to a basket of currencies in which the weighting of 
the dollar is rumoured to be 70 per cent, not coincidentally the proportion of 
the dollar held in international central bank hard currency reserves. Kuwait’s 
decision to abandon the dollar peg was prescient because it preceded the credit 
crunch, the bank runs and failures that forced an emergency Fed lending of the 
last resort and ignited inflation psychology in the financial markets. This 
meant a worldwide run on the dollar, particularly against the Euro, Swiss franc 
and gold. The Kuwaiti dinar has appreciated 2 per cent against the dollar since 
the peg was abandoned. Interestingly, Kuwaiti central bank governor Sheikh Salem 
Al-Sabah stated that domestic inflation fell by 0.5 per cent since May, proving 
the strong linkage between imported inflation and dollar currency pegs in the 
Gulf.<br><br>Two, the GCC common currency project has clearly lost momentum. Oman has opted 
out of the 2010 monetary union pipeline because of concerns on budget deficit 
and government spending restrictions. Now even the UAE central bank governor 
Sultan Al Suweidi has publicly stated that the deadline for monetary union has 
been postponed to 2010. This is ominous because the whole idea of the GCC 
currency peg was to facilitate convergence on the path to monetary union. But if 
the GCC common currency is a chimera, the political and monetary logic of the 
currency pegs falls apart.<br><br><b>Dollar woes</b><br>The dollar woes accelerated after the September 18 FOMC discount and fund rate 
cut, a clear signal that the Federal Reserve was unnerved by the credit crunch 
on Wall Street and the tangible systemic risk in the banking system. While the 
September US payroll data has given a temporary relief to the dollar, the 
broader fundamental scenario is clearly greenback negative. Consumer spending 
cannot remain immune from the deflation shock of a housing recession and 
consumer spending is two-thirds of US GDP growth. Moreover, the interbank market 
has still not returned to normal, with three-month LIBOR trading 60 basis points 
above the Fed’s overnight borrowing rate and bank credit risk (as expressed by 
the TED spread or the Treasury Eurodollar yield spread) at its highs. So the 
likelihood of slowing US economic growth, additional rate cuts by the FOMC and 
the increasing desire of Japanese, Russian, Chinese and Arab central banks to 
unload excessive dollar reserves all argues that dollar selling will remain the 
default option in the global foreign exchange market in 2008. Of course, the 
wild card is geopolitical risk in the Middle East, upside surprises in US 
economic data or another panic driven asset market contagion. The next milestone 
for the dollar is if the Fed will cut rates to 4.5 per cent at the October FOMC. 
Of course, the ECB will not raise rates either and if the politicians in Berlin 
and Frankfurt do not ease rates in October, the dollar could temporarily rise to 
1.35. However, long term, the dollar’s path of least resistance is decidedly 
lower.<br><br>Three, the linkage between imported inflation and the currency peg is most 
pronounced in the smaller, more open economies in the Gulf, particularly Qatar 
and UAE. The UAE share of imports from the EU is no less than 30 per cent, 
meaning the revaluation of the Euro from 0.85 cents four years now to 1.40 now 
has been a macroeconomic disaster for the Gulf’s fastest growing economy. The 
rise in the Euro was all the more painful because it coincided with a liquidity 
tsunami and an unprecedented property boom in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi. For 
instance, M3 money supply has grown by more than 20 per cent in the past year in 
the UAE.<br><br>It is, of course, necessary to point out that a one-time revaluation of the UAE 
dirham, particularly a modest 3-4 per cent adjustment, will not exactly solve 
the inflation dilemma faced by UAE policymakers. After all, rents have tripled 
in Dubai since 2004 and the price of everything from cements to foodstuffs has 
surged, meaning a 20-year high in domestic inflation estimated at 12 per cent. 
Empirically, rent caps have not been successful in containing domestic 
inflation. So the UAE central bank must execute an independent monetary policy 
if it must proactively act to contain the inflation surge that threatens the 
global competitiveness of the UAE. Four, the pressure on the GCC currency pegs 
(particularly UAE and Qatar) has been accentuated by the fact that monetary 
policy imperatives in the US and the GCC now diverge to an exceptional degree. 
The US faces a consumer slowdown, retail and auto sales softness, financial 
distress, real estate deflation and high probability of recession risk.<br><br>
<b>The GCC peg</b><br>The macroeconomic realities in the GCC are exactly the opposite. Real GDP growth 
as high as 8-10 per cent, record inflation rate, breakneck bank credit and money 
supply growth, a GCC current account surplus that is an incredible 30 per cent 
of GDP, a surge in wages, rents, a construction boom that has made the UAE 
second only to China in consumption of cranes, huge government spending on real 
estate and infrastructure projects with crude oil prices at a record $80. Real 
interest rates in the GCC, thanks to the peg, are excessively negative, leading 
to speculative excesses in the property market and bank loan books. Yet, the 
currency peg eliminates monetary policy as an inflation fighting mechanism for 
the GCC central banks. The cost of adhering to the peg has simply become too 
painful as the economic cycles of the GCC and the US diverge.<br><br>But will a modest revaluation of the UAE dirham or Qatari riyal solve the Gulf’s 
inflation malaise? I doubt it. Purchasing power parity suggests the GCC 
currencies are undervalued by 25-30 per cent, the most undervalued currencies on 
the planet with the exception of the Chinese Yuan. Moreover, GCC central banks 
have not responded to the Fed rate cuts with commensurate falls in local money 
market rates. In essence, the existence of the pegs and higher money market 
rates has now made the Gulf currencies a classic destination for hot money carry 
trade speculators. Why did the GCC central banks not mirror a 50 basis point 
cut? My hunch is the GCC central banks expect the Fed to pause next month. They 
thought the September rate cut was a knee jerk response to banking crises on 
Wall Street and Europe. In essence, the GCC central banks were buying time. But 
if the credit crunch deepens and the Fed is forced to cut the overnight 
borrowing rate down to zero (as happens during systemic banking crises such as 
after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 2000 Silicon Valley tech bubble 
burst), all bets are off. GCC currency pegs will be history.<br><br>The abandonment of the GCC currency pegs can have enormous consequences for the 
region. After all, FX translation losses for regions banks and sovereign 
investment agencies will be colossal. Moreover, regional corporates have been 
lulled into complacency by the existence of the currency pegs, some dating back 
to the 1980s. The central banks of the GCC also do not have a track record of 
independent monetary management. After all, as Paul Volcker proved in the 1980s, 
successful inflation fighting requires positive real rates of interest. Can the 
Gulf live with a three-month money market rate of 10 per cent? That will mean 
recession and a collapse in the leveraged property markets across the region. 
Hundreds of banks and financial institutions will also be doomed, as happened 
with US savings and loans. Yet the Chicago School and Milton Friedman argue that 
inflation is a monetary phenomenon and can only be combated by choking the money 
supply. Inflation never has a pretty endgame. This is a lesson investors, savers 
and central bankers in the GCC have learnt in the past three years.<br><br><i>Matein Khalid is a renowned investment banker based in Dubai</i></font></p>

Queues inside money exchanges have not dwindled, instead are on the rise, thanks 
to the fall in the exchange value of Omani Rial against non-US Dollar 
currencies. Expats are in a no-hold mode – fearing a drop in the exchange rate 
on a daily basis – and pushing more money back home.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">Welcome to the Sultanate of Oman. The US$35.3-billion economy growing at around 
6.5 per cent per annum is a fact to cheer about. Global oil prices, soaring 
towards US$100 a barrel, are another reason to rejoice, notwithstanding the 
depleting reserves. Construction is in full swing. Multibillion-dollar tourism 
and infrastructure projects are being unveiled; in fact some are already 
underway. Yet, celebrations are missing. Not only in the Sultanate, but across 
the Gulf Cooperation Council member countries. The reason is not too far to 
seek: the US Dollar meltdown.<br>
<br>
What has the Dollar’s debacle got to do with the Gulf currencies – be it the 
Omani Rial or Saudi Riyal, Qatari Rial, Bahraini Dinar, Kuwaiti Dinar, UAE 
Dirham? A lot, because the GCC countries are married to the US legal tender: 
officially, these currencies are ‘pegged’ to the US Dollar. And, this is why 
they are in a bind. If Dollar sneezes, the Gulf currencies catch a cold. If the 
Dollar falls, the Gulf currencies follow suit. And, vice-versa. So, is the 
marriage going bad. No, the difference today is that they got into this 
convenience of currency wedlock when the US currency was at its strongest. 
Today, the scenario is different. <br>
<br>
<b>Bleeding Dollar<br>
</b>The dollar is bleeding, thanks to a slew of factors: imports are on the 
rise, creating a huge current account deficit; the sub-prime lending crisis is 
giving the US Federal Reserve sleepless nights; even as expenditure is 
burgeoning on the ‘War on Terror’ front. Today, everyone expects Fed Chairman 
Ben Bernanke not to throw out the baby with the bathwater: to manage the 
domestic economy and simultaneously ensure the world does not go into a 
tailspin. After all, the world’s only superpower can ill-afford to be seen as 
the weakest. <br>
<br>
When in September, Bernanke announced an unexpected 50 basis point cut in the US 
interest rates, as per conventional wisdom, the six-pack GCC member-countries 
should have followed suit, and eased their respective lending rates. But that is 
not what happened? The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the most powerful GCC giant and 
the world’s largest oil exporter, refused to tango, sending shock waves across 
the global currency markets. Reason: domestic compulsions. What is that? Read 
rising inflation on the home front. The Kingdom of Bahrain also said ‘No’, 
citing the same grounds. Of course, the Sultanate of Oman too joined cause with 
the Saudis on this issue.<br>
<br>
What has inflation got to do with interest rates? When an economy is receding 
into recession, central banks invariably slash their interest rates to pep up 
lending, to boost demand and thus revive the economy. The American economy is in 
a poor shape and hence the Bernanke formula of slashing interest rate makes 
sense. But what about the booming oil-exporting Gulf economies? Should they 
swallow the same American recipe? Any sane economist will veto such a move. Why? 
A booming economy means heightened activity. Monetary policy initiatives such as 
reining in money supply is of paramount importance. To put it differently, 
tighten money supply via making lending costlier. That is, hike interest rates!<br>
<br>
<b>GCC Logjam<br>
</b>This is the logjam the GCC countries are in. They simply cannot ape the 
American monetary policy. A peek at the Gulf domestic inflation rates can be an 
eye-opener: Oman reported 6.47 per cent – the highest in 16 years as on August 
31.<br>
<br>
Saudi Arabia 4.4 per cent (August), a 7-year high; Bahrain 5.2 per cent 
(August); Qatar 12.8 per cent (June), UAE 9.6 per cent (2007), and Kuwait 5.5 
per cent (March).<br>
<br>
A single common thread, attributed to the rise in cost of living (that is what 
inflation is all about), was the abnormal increase in house rent and charges on 
food and beverages. Qatar’s finance minister Yussef Hussein Kamal, who was 
witness to 14.8 per cent inflation in March , claims that house rent has gone 
through the roof by a whopping 168 per cent in the past two years. The fact that 
60-70 per cent of one’s personal income goes towards house rent in an economy 
growing at 8.8 per cent is a pain. Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) governor 
Hamad Saud Al-Sayyari admits that the price of essential commodities have risen 
by 6.6 per cent in addition to 12.1 per cent increase in rental outgo. <br>
<br>
What about Oman? As per Central Bank chief Hamood Sangour Al Zadjali, the 
consumer price index rose to 111.9 points (August 31). According to him, the 
food and beverages and tobacco component surged 12.1 per cent and that of rent 
by 7.5 per cent. All these mathematical mumbo-jumbo will make sense when one 
realises that the rate of inflation in the entire Gulf stood at less than 1 per 
cent until two years ago. An almost frozen cost of living coupled with a 
tax-free regime was the major attraction for expatriates, on whom the richest 
Gulf region depends majorly for economic activities, to flock to this region for 
decades. Today, inflation is a reality resulting in an erosion in real income, 
upsetting all calculations. <br>
<br>
Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not mince words. It said in its 
biannual global survey released in mid-October that with booming demand and 
rising import prices, “inflation is accelerating” in the Gulf region. Consumer 
prices on an annual basis have shot up 10.8 per cent this year, after a 7.5 per 
cent increase in 2006, and are projected to rise 9.2 per cent in 2008. Any 
specific culprit? In the GCC, a weakening dollar has also added to inflationary 
pressures, raising the cost of imports, according to the IMF.<br>
<br>
<b>Kuwaiti Boldness</b><br>
The Dollar meltdown is a major cause for concern for Gulf economies. Yet, they 
are not ready for quick, remedial action. There is a universal opinion that 
these countries ought to consider unplugging their Dollar parity. Bluntly put, 
move away from the apron strings of the US economy and prepare your own monetary 
policy. Kuwait is the solitary country in the region to have pulled out of the 
Dollar mystique. It did so in May, citing, what else, the Dollar’s slide in the 
global markets was making imports more expensive and driving up inflation. 
Instead, Kuwaiti Dinar will now be valued against a basket of currencies? Why? 
“It gives the bank the flexibility to track moves on global foreign exchange 
markets,” reasoned Central Bank governor Salem Abdul-Aziz.<br>
<br>
<b>Oman Scenario<br>
</b>What about other GCC members? Are they ready and willing to consider 
dropping Dollar parity? No way. Oman’s Commerce and Industry Minister Maqbool 
bin Ali Sultan admitted that Oman did consider measures, including unshackling 
the Rial from the tumbling US Dollar, but decided against the move. The options 
before His Majesty’s government are:</font></p>

  <font face="Verdana" size="1">Expanding foodstuff processing units</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">So far, Sultan has decided to stay with the Dollar “in view of the government’s 
strategy, which is based on free trade and market economics”. He went further to 
extol the virtues of such a linkage: “For an open economy like Oman, the fixed 
peg to the US Dollar works as the strongest source of stability, which is very 
essential for promoting trade and investment.” <br><br>Zadjali, while admitting that inflation is a matter of concern, does not want to 
panic. “The levels are still considered to be moderate when seen in relation to 
the high growth being witnessed in the economy and when compared within the 
region”. Inflation, according to him, is mainly from external sources, such as 
that arising from specific goods imported into Oman and the price pass-through 
effect of sustained depreciation of the US Dollar. <br><br>So, how does Oman plans inflation management? As against revaluing its currency, 
Oman in July dropped a provision allowing banks to use their foreign currency 
holdings as part of their 3 per cent reserve requirement. Besides, proper 
monetary management of liquidity and moderate fiscal expenditure will help rein 
in inflationary trends, Zadjali believes. To fight the rising rental outgo, the 
government has fixed a 15 per cent cap in hike for the next two years. <br><br>Middle East policymakers, IMF cautions, need to “carefully calibrate” their 
spending on investment and social projects to the capacity of the economy to 
absorb such outlays. But with the outlook for oil prices likely to remain 
strong, “raising the trend of government spending would be warranted.” As it has 
frequently done in the past, the IMF said the main challenge confronting oil 
exporters is to develop their non-oil sectors, an initiative that “hinges on 
reforms to improve the business climate and make investment in non-oil sectors 
more attractive.”<br><br><b>Varied Opinions</b><br>The Gulf economies’ fixation with Dollar parity has not been well received. Saxo 
Bank, in its recent report, says that from the Middle East perspective, the GCC 
could unanimously either re-peg their currencies to a lower dollar rate or they 
could instead peg it to a basket of currencies, including the Dollar. Such a 
scenario makes economic sense where the US economy is no longer the bedrock of 
the global financial system and trade flows from the Middle East are more 
dynamic and more multilateral, involving many economic partners.<br><br>To cut the Dollar link or not? Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman 
Khalil Al Khonji is a Dollar sympathiser. “There are basically two schools of 
thoughts on this issue. I believe that from the perspective of industrialists 
and businessmen, staying with the dollar is a less risky affair than moving away 
to a basket of currencies.” Fincorp’ s Munir Makki prefers a moderate route. 
“Keep intact the Dollar but appreciate with it – which I think is the best way” 
(See Box: Appreciate Rial).<br><br>Unlike in the past, the Gulf economies do not entirely depend on its oil export 
to the US alone. Today, their trade partners are diversified and there is a 
concerted effort to move away from oil-dependency through various other non-oil 
export activities such as manufacturing, construction boom, free trade zones, 
etc. With China and India setting up a scorching growth path, their energy 
requirements are skyrocketing, thus creating a fresh business opportunity for 
the oil-rich Gulf economies. <br><br><b>Dollar Exit</b><br>Significantly, the Dollar meltdown has compelled many to take a fresh guard to 
protect their respective economies. Qatar, one of the staunchest allies of the 
US and whose currency is pegged to the greenback, is cutting down its Dollar 
exposure by half. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim 
bin Jabor al-Thani revealed that in early October Qatar’s US$50 billion 
sovereign wealth fund brought its dollar exposure to 40 per cent. Qatar 
Investment Authority’s moolah is parked: 40 per cent in US Dollars; 40 per cent 
in Euro; and 20 per cent in other currencies. Does this mean, Qatar is readying 
for a delink from the Dollar? “Nothing at this moment. No,” adds Al-Thani.<br>
<br>Among other nations, Vietnam, which holds US$40 billion in reserves, is slashing 
its purchase of US treasuries and other Dollar-denominated bonds. Vietnam is 
seen as a weather vane for the bigger Asian powers. Together with China 
(US$1,340 billion), South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand, they 
collectively hold US$3,775 billion in foreign reserves. Citing that the Dollar 
exposure is overheating the domestic economy and driving up inflation, Vietnam 
said that it would gradually move towards a floating currency. Analysts see this 
as a move of no confidence in the US economic management. Iran, expectedly, is 
talking about the possibility of its refusal to accept dollars for its dollar 
exports, preferring to be paid in a “more credible currency”. It will be of 
interest to note that hardly 15 per cent of Iran’s oil exports are denominated 
in the Dollar. It prefers to whittle down even this to avoid the excessive risk 
of devaluation.<br><br>Kuwait is more or less out of the Dollar loop. Bernanke’s actions matter very 
little to it. But others’ are not yet in the clear. It will be no surprise if 
the US Fed Reserve Chairman were to go for fresh interest rate cuts in the days 
to come. What is the prognosis for the US economy at this juncture? “It seems 
that the problems faced by US economy are more complex than ever before. The oil 
rich Arab world will probably continue to recycle petrodollars in the US 
treasury. But at some point they will also want to be compensated for a weaker 
dollar,” reasons Toronto-based Chief Investment Officer Zaigham Shah, whose 
FrontierAlt Inc has the GCC on its radar for parking funds.<br><br>So, if Bernanke were to sneeze next time, can the central bank honchos in Oman, 
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and UAE afford to turn a blind eye and go on their 
own path? It will be a tough call. For when all is said and done, we are talking 
about the world’s one and only superpower which does not believe in mavericks. 
Follow the leader or else.…<br><br>In 1986, it made a lot of economic sense for the Gulf economies to embrace the 
US Dollar parity. Today the situation is different. Conventional wisdom says, 
there are ‘horses for courses’. Hence, the decision to drop the Dollar peg – if 
it were to happen – will be more of a political, rather than an economic issue. 
Therefore, the royal heads of GCC will be the final arbiters in settling the 
Dollar dilemma once for all. So, who’s going to blink first? Let’s wait and 
watch.</font></p>

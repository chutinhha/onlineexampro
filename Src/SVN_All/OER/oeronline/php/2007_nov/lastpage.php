        <b>A.B. Singh, Senior General Manager, OTE Group, believes a good 
        manager is always adaptable to change, since that is inevitable. Sunil 
        Kumar Singh meets him over a cup of coffee<br>
        </b><br>
        <img border="0" src="lastpage.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Good 
        managers often incorporate their instincts and experiences along with 
        hard facts and data in making heavyweight business decisions. Take the 
        case of A.B. Singh Bhatia, Senior GM (Tyres, Shell and Batteries 
        division), OTE Group, who has had a long managerial spell, spanning over 
        25 years, with over 15 years with the OTE Group, since it’s inception. 
        “Management styles cannot be fixed. They undergo changes as the 
        situation may demand. One should never lose sight of the fact that 
        nothing lasts forever: market situations in Oman have changed so often,” 
        says A.B, a techie who did his Chemical Engineering from the prestigious 
        Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and subsequently switched to 
        management.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Balancing act</b><br>
        A.B. believes in following an inclusivist approach. For him, life is a 
        package – consisting of one’s family, work, God, beliefs, health, 
        friends, self-respect, and money. And life can only be lived up to the 
        brim if all these elements are managed in a balanced way. No wonder, A.B. 
        is today content with what life has taught him – belief in hard work, 
        fairness, honesty and fun. It is these that keep him motivated to move 
        forward. Before coming to Muscat, A.B. worked in Basel, Switzerland, as 
        well as in India, where he was a national head with Usha International 
        Ltd and was declared the Best National Manager for a record three times 
        at the annual divisional manager’s contest.<br>
        <br>
        But today for him, Oman is what every country should be like. “Oman is a 
        combination of tradition and modernity; has world-class infrastructure; 
        is going through rapid industrialisation and expansion; is adorned with 
        beautiful landscapes and has friendly people with respect for others.”<br>
        <br>
        For A.B, success is all-encompassing that takes into account one’s 
        professional well-being, a good bringing up of one’s family, good 
        relations with friends and co-workers, and a sense of fulfilment. “You 
        can achieve professional targets, but at the same time leave a highly 
        de-motivated and dissatisfied team. Such success at the most will be 
        short term.” he explains, adding, “Permit your co-workers and staff to 
        take part in decision making and give them considerable freedom to carry 
        out their work. Each team member should know the ultimate as well as 
        their individual objectives and will thus be more willing to take 
        ownership of his role.” <br>
        <br>
        <b>Family matters</b><br>
        A.B. is a complete family man and never forgets to spend quality time 
        with family and friends. He also has a penchant for oil painting and 
        music and used to play the Hawaiian guitar but now finds little time for 
        such pursuits. While in the IIT, he hitchhiked through South East Asia 
        roughing out 63 days on the road without spending any money on food, 
        accommodation or travel. “I slept even in telephone booths”. Today, it 
        is his job that fulfils his fondness for travel helping him visit 
        numerous countries, either on professional or personal trips. To keep 
        himself in shape physically and mentally, his schedule includes daily 
        morning walks, swimming and meditation.<br>
        <br>
        On the whole, A.B believes that a manager’s key role lies in minimising 
        obstacles coming in the way of his staff, expanding opportunities and 
        recognising that the role of each member is important in the success of 
        the organisation. And his message to budding managers – ‘Focus on the 
        objective, go out there and get the job done’.</font></p></td>

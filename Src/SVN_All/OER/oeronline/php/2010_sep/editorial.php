				Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as a leader who has the capacity 
				to look beyond the numbers and to observe and influence the 
				health and culture of a workplace can be as important to an 
				organisation as the CEO. The recent business failures in the US 
				and Europe has seen the role of the CFO coming into sharper 
				focus. A skilled CFO is not just responsible for financial 
				reports but he is also in a good position to detect early signs 
				of bad health and poor culture. The CFO’s role is particularly 
				crucial in ensuring the integrity, openness and honesty of an 
				organisation because finance more than any other function is 
				involved right across a company. While the CEO determines the 
				key drivers of the business, the CFO designs the key indicators 
				of those drivers and ensures their integrity. <br>
				<br>
				CFOs aren’t particularly known for moving out of the comfort 
				zone of the books they keep, but the credit crisis provided them 
				that challenge or – as some finance heads would like to see it – 
				the opportunity to move out of their traditional domain. Cash, 
				costs, communication, confidence. Those four Cs sum up the 
				mandate of the CFO in a year (2008-09) when everything that 
				could go wrong – and also things that many thought would never 
				go wrong – went spectacularly awry. And it was for the CFO to 
				step into the breach like never before. As demand and liquidity 
				dried up, cash flows had to be expanded. As margins came under a 
				squeeze, costs came under the microscope. <br>
				<br>
				The CFO had to scrounge for capital in a world starved of that 
				till-recently taken-for-granted resource. Suddenly, the rules of 
				the game had changed: Finance heads who once had little problems 
				raising funds to make big-ticket acquisitions were now 
				struggling to find capital to keep those assets afloat and 
				squeeze growth out of them in recession-hit markets.<br>
				<br>
				That’s when the other two Cs moved up in priority in the CFO’s 
				lexicon. Investors, vendors, customers and employers had to be 
				first told about the realities in the market place and on the 
				balance sheet and then confidence instilled into them that this 
				too would pass. CFO’s in Oman have played a similar role to 
				steer their companies through rough times. Our cover story 
				captures the experience of a cross section of these business 
				leaders, who are truly the superheroes of our times.<br>

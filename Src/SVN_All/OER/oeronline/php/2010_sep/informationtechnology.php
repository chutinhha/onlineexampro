				When Samatel, the latest telecommunications provider, launched 
				its services in Oman recently, besides the mobile services, a 
				lot of stress was laid on its contact centre. Additionally, the 
				company disclosed that more call centres would be opened in 
				Mabela and Bid Bid respectively within a year. The contact 
				centres of Samatel are expected to offer business solutions, 
				including telemarketing, helpdesk and one-stop-shop marketing 
				services.<br>
				<br>
				To help get its contact centres up and running, Samatel tied up 
				with Teleperformers – the biggest outsourcing company in the 
				world. For its mobile operations, Samatel entered into an 
				agreement with Effortel from Belgium, an MVNE (mobile virtual 
				network enabler), which facilitates the entry of companies into 
				the mobile reselling business.<br>
				<br>
				Obviously, the contact centre and the mobile services involves a 
				lot of IT infrastructure beginning from “SunRay Desktop 
				replacement solutions” to complex data servers and all the other 
				paraphernalia in between. The notable part is that Samatel roped 
				in Oman Computer Network Systems (Oman CNS), a major regional 
				ICT system integrator and managed services company.<br>
				<br>
				“Over the years we have selected best-of-breed Original 
				Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) for IT infrastructure products and 
				best-in-class specialists for middleware products. Which is why 
				Samatel, a start up company in the telecom field chose us to set 
				up their IT infrastructure,” says Mufaddal Nafar, Area Sales 
				Manager, Oman CNS, while talking about their association with 
				Samatel. Oman CNS as a leading system integrator from UAE now 
				offering high quality of services and turnkey IT solutions from 
				KOM.<br>
				<br>
				“Clients are attracted by our structured DREAM methodology 
				(Define, Review, Engineer, Accelerate, Manage) by which we have 
				created an organisation that can simplify end-to-end ICT needs 
				of big or small companies, starting from the design and staying 
				with the client throughout the technology lifespan,” says Nafar 
				while talking about the activities of Oman CNS. Samatel and Oman 
				CNS are two of the examples of how IT in Oman is growing at 
				broadband pace as an increasing number of companies reap the 
				benefits of modernising their operations by spending on modern 
				IT technologies.<br>

				<br>
				Recent reports by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) 
				indicated that the Sultanate’s thriving Information Technology 
				services industry is poised to grow by 10 per cent and will 
				cross the half a billion dollar mark by 2011. Oman along with 
				Qatar, Bahrain, and Jordan, will play significant role in the 
				Middle East IT services market, which is to hit $3.5bn by next 
				year, the report said.<br>
				<br>
				The IT market in Oman is only about 10 per cent the size of 
				other GCC markets, but the government is investing in IT as part 
				of its Digital Oman initiative and strategy to diversify the 
				economy. In addition, there is a rise in demand for IT services 
				from verticals such as oil &amp; gas, telecommunications, aviation 
				and financial services.<br>
				<br>
				Says Sameer Gupta, executive vice president, Infoline: 
				“Sustainable growth in the ICT sector has backed economic 
				progress and provides a strong platform for the development of 
				SMEs. The SMEs, in turn, have invested heavily on advanced and 
				innovative technologies, which have been a key contributing 
				factor to increased IT spending in the region.”<br>
				Infoline is a premiere brand in the growing sunshine industry of 
				IT and ITES (IT Enabled Services) with one of the largest 
				contact centre in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				Further, economic reforms and trade liberalisation will initiate 
				more spending by both public sector organisations and 
				enterprises and the areas of predominant investment will be 
				e-commerce platforms and back office systems; cloud computing; 
				and IT infrastructure management.<br>

				when investments into large projects began pouring in and the 
				government took up large scale infrastructure development. There 
				has been an average growth of 8-10 per cent year-on-year in the 
				IT sector with more than $300mn being spent this year alone,” 
				says K Ram Subramanian, GM, Information Technology Division of Imtac, one of the premier technology providers in the Sultanate.<br>
				<br>
				The term IT mainly deals with computer applications computing 
				technology, covering everything from installing applications to 
				developing databases. Today, the common work environment is 
				completely automated and totally dependent on computers. One of 
				the main reasons for this tremendous growth has been the 
				internet, which Subramanian says, has been a big enabler and 
				differentiator as it has become the platform on which the 
				technologies are running now.<br>
				<br>
				Starting as a distributor of Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 1984, Imtac 
				managed a consistent growth since then to emerge as one of the 
				largest technology companies in the Sultanate. The company is 
				one of the few with complete and locally available expertise to 
				carry out large technology projects in the region.<br>
				<br>
				Subramanian says that several e-services being rendered by 
				government organisations like the Muscat Municipality’s parking 
				violations, Rent Contract System and other solutions have been 
				provided by Imtac.<br>
				<br>
				Similarly, Imtac has implemented the National Payment System and 
				other automation services being rendered by CBO. Imtac’s clients 
				include at least four major banks and other large corporates 
				like PDO, ITA, Ministry of Health and Oman Refinery and 
				Petroleum Company. All these organisations have a strong IT 
				backbone.<br>

				Emax Store feels that once individuals and businesspersons 
				realised the necessity of computers at home, the awareness 
				levels of technology began to rise and soon it became a natural 
				extension that they began to utilise IT in their companies and 
				offices.<br>
				Says Tankha: “Previously, there used to be a single mobile 
				handset per family. Now every adult member has more than one 
				handset. This trend is now catching up with computers as well. 
				The father will be having a laptop besides the desktop computer 
				at home. Then the college-going children also need a laptop for 
				their studies. This way, every home has now begun to have two or 
				three computers or laptops.”<br>
				<br>
				The large-scale economic developments in the Sultanate have 
				definitely helped the growth of IT, says Tankha. “The last two 
				years have been like a boom-time,” he admits while saying that 
				laptops, computers, hardware like printers were the fast moving 
				products at the Emax store, set up at Muscat City Centre in 
				2007. <br>
				<br>
				Continuing further, Tankha says that the popularity of the 
				social media like Facebook and Twitter has only enhanced the 
				value of internet, which in turn helps in the growth of IT. As 
				many companies begin to integrate social media into their 
				publicity campaigns, it only added to the rising demand for IT 
				products, he adds.<br>
				<br>
				Gupta concurs with this when he says that IT has always been an 
				essential tool of commerce, but it has become increasingly 
				important since the development of the personal computer and the 
				Internet. Consumers and clients demand efficient service and 
				rapid communication, and even the smallest of small businesses 
				cannot do without effective information technology.<br>
				<br>
				“The most significant advantage of employing information 
				technology is data knowledge. With the development of email, 
				texting, and the wide variety of social media technologies, 
				consumers demand an almost immediate response – and IT services 
				can provide that immediate communication effectively and 
				inexpensively,” adds Gupta.<br>

				life, says Haitham Abu Nasser, general manager/ partner, 
				Integrated Systems (IS). Take a car for example, says Nasser. 
				The computer chip inside the car’s system is involved in the 
				smooth running of the vehicle and all safety aspects are 
				controlled by it. This is the way forward for us as we utilise 
				the benefits of IT to make our life easier and convenient, 
				Nasser opines. The government’s Digital Oman strategy, which is 
				being spearheaded by the Information Technology Authority (ITA) 
				is actually a step in that direction. <br>
				<br>
				The eGovernment services portal’s stated aim is to transform the 
				Sultanate of Oman into a sustainable knowledge society to 
				empower the people and businesses with information and services 
				by delivering all eGovernment services through a common gateway 
				in a seamless manner.<br>
				<br>
				“Integrating government services with businesses and individuals 
				requires massive IT infrastructure and implementation of new 
				technology solutions to gain competitive advantage and achieve 
				business goals. Therefore practically every IT company in Oman 
				is involved with ITA in one way or other as vendors or 
				partners,” says Nasser.<br>
				<br>
				Integrated Services, which is a full service company providing 
				IT infrastructure, security, safety, building management, 
				communications and audio visual expertise, offers complete 
				turnkey solutions and has clients from the public as well as the 
				private sector. When organisations realise that they can cut 
				down costs between 20-40 per cent by automation of their 
				processes, then they decide to implement IT in their companies. 
				This will fuel the growth, says Nasser.<br>

				new technologies are adding value and providing new 
				opportunities for businesses as newer applications speed up 
				production processes and accounting systems. As key business 
				processes began to be identified, the need for associated 
				information requirements, hardware, software and bespoke 
				applications began to grow. Thus, IT began to be aligned with 
				core business requirements.<br>
				<br>
				With the evolution of technology and constant innovations by 
				technology giants like Google and Microsoft, the mode of IT 
				operations is changing. Cloud computing is emerging as a 
				favourite among organisations, which want to cut costs and 
				increase their operational efficiency.<br>
				<br>
				IT service providers like Infoline and Gulf IT are popularising 
				Cloud Computing and providing services using the Cloud Computing 
				Platform – thereby ensuring IT solution offerings on par with 
				latest global developments.<br>
				Cloud computing is basically done with Google Apps which has 
				email, calendaring, instant messaging, document, spreadsheets 
				and presentations, site creation and video without having any 
				software of your own, says Rahul Bhavsar, business head, Middle 
				East, Gulf IT.<br>
				<br>
				“The applications are hosted by Google, so you can just turn 
				them on and get to work quickly. With this cloud computing 
				approach, you don’t need to worry about installing, maintaining 
				or upgrading software, and you always have access to the latest 
				technology. You can also use any device: PC, Mac, Linux, Android 
				or iPad, if it has a web browser and a connection to the 
				Internet you can access your information from anywhere,” Bhavsar 
				says.<br>
				<br>
				“The cost savings are compelling, especially when you’re on a 
				tight budget: cloud computing is about one tenth of the cost of 
				on-premises software. It’s also more secure than storing data on 
				laptops and USB keys that are easily lost or stolen,” adds 
				Bhavsar.<br>
				<br>
				Along with cloud computing, another IT solution is cloud codes, 
				which provides an ease of use, affordable, and reliable source 
				for getting all the Small &amp; Medium Enterprise (SME) software 
				needs in the cloud. This single development and delivery model 
				significantly reduces the time and costs associated with the 
				development and delivery of enterprise systems.<br>

				wave in IT Enabled Services (ITES). As countries strive to 
				develop knowledge based economies, the growing demand for IT and 
				ITES would rise. However, it has been observed that companies 
				are reluctant to make huge investments in technology and hence 
				resort to outsourcing.<br>
				<br>
				The customer contact centre industry across the Middle East is 
				to a large extent at the developing stage and definitely, a 
				vision exists for a more matured growth in the long run. One of 
				the latest regulatory developments in the Middle East has been 
				the initiatives towards opening of VOIP (Voice Over Internet 
				Protocol) which will lay the foundation for Middle East contact 
				centres standing up on par with the global standards.<br>
				<br>

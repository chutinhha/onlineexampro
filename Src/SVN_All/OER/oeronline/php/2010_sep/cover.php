					crisis presented CFOs in Oman with unprecedented challenges

					<b><br>
                    </b>Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) today are like doctors 
					who have just been through a prolonged medical emergency. 
					Epidemics test the ability of medical professionals and 
					fundamentally challenge the conventional wisdom of the 
					times. The financial crisis that engulfed the world for most 
					of 2008 and 2009 placed CFOs in a similar situation.<br>
					<br>
					Overnight, some of the most acclaimed financial strategies 
					and innovations became a terrible mistake. Well thought-out 
					acquisitions suddenly became over-ambitious forays. CFOs 
					witnessed the unprecedented destruction of wealth and fought 
					for wealthier times to come. Says Vishal Goenka, CFO, 
					Renaissance Services, “The CFO also needs to create value by 
					pulling together cross functional teams in the organisation 
					to really think about how to drive productivity and 
					efficiency, how we can allocate resources and where we can 
					find more value in the business.”<br>
					<br>
					Cash, costs, communication, confidence. Those four Cs sum up 
					the mandate of the CFO in a year (2008-09) when everything 
					that could go wrong – and also things that many thought 
					would never go wrong – went spectacularly awry. And it was 
					for the CFO to step into the breach like never before. “The 
					finance function is the glue that binds an organisation 
					together,” says Phil Beale, CFO, The Wave, Muscat. As demand 
					and liquidity dried up, cash flows had to be expanded. As 
					margins came under a squeeze, costs came under the 
					microscope.<br>
					<br>
					The CFO had to scrounge for capital in a world starved of 
					that till-recently-taken-for-granted resource. Suddenly, the 
					rules of the game had changed: Finance heads who once had 
					little problems raising funds to make big-ticket 
					acquisitions were now struggling to find capital to keep 
					those assets afloat and squeeze growth out of them in 
					recession-hit markets. Says Hafidh Al Harthy, CFO and 
					secretary to the Board of Directors, Qalhat LNG “A lot of 
					organisation’s ignored the very basics of business/risk 
					management and suffered severe consequences of the global 
					financial crisis.”<br>
					<br>
					That’s when the other two Cs moved up in priority in the 
					CFO’s lexicon. Investors, vendors, customers and employers 
					had to be first told about the realities in the market place 
					and on the balance sheet; and then confidence instilled into 
					them that this too would pass. Now CFOs aren’t particularly 
					known for moving out of the comfort zone of the books they 
					keep, but the credit crisis provided them that challenge or 
					– as some finance heads would like to see it – the 
					opportunity.<br>
					<br>
					As liquidity conditions ease, demand picks up, and clients 
					and consumers are more prone to spend, CFOs will doubtless 
					breathe easier, but the smart ones among them won’t forget 
					the lessons of frugality, restraint, and the need for 
					balance that they picked up in the tough times.<br>

					Yousuf Al Lawati, Corporate Finance Manager, Oman LNG is 
					confident about the future prospects of gas and sees the 
					downturn as a temporary phenomenon</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<b>
					<br>
					</b>Never Maqbool Yousuf Al Lawati, corporate finance 
					manager, Oman LNG, says “The challenges faced by a CFO 
					depended on the industry that he was in. Our company and the 
					oil and gas sector did not have such a large impact. On the 
					employment side too we did not have any major challenge.” 
					This is not to say that the company remained completely 
					unscathed by the downturn. As the government’s cash flows 
					got affected in the wake of the financial crisis, it was 
					forced to revisit its development plans. This in turn 
					affected the company as the government is Oman LNG’s biggest</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#C00000"><img border="0" src="images/sep_cover1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0; " align="right" width="200" height="212"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
					shareholder. The LNG major had to revisit its cash flow and 
					see how this would impact the government’s receipts. “As oil 
					prices plummeted from $140 per barrel to $30 per barrel it 
					became imperative for us to look at our earnings and to give 
					the government a forecast of our future cash flows,” says Maqbool. Oman LNG is the Sultanate’s second largest revenue 
					generator and whenever something drastic happens, the 
					company is called upon to help out.<br>
					<br>
					The other big challenge was that the government was 
					borrowing from local banks. As the crisis intensified 
					international banks could not continue financing local 
					banks. And as local banks had large commitments Oman LNG was 
					asked if it could help boost the local liquidity situation. 
					Says Maqbool, “We had a lot of cash and were able to shift 
					money to local banks by moving our funds in local deposits 
					and the feedback was quite positive.”<br>
					<br>
					<b>No worries<br>
					</b><br>
					While other companies were grappling with cash flow 
					problems, Oman LNG had no such issues. “Though our total 
					cash flows were affected, the nature of our transactions and 
					the solid customer base ensured that our finances were in a 
					sound condition and we did not have problem in our 
					receipts.”<br>
					<br>
					Cost rationalisation is a continuous process at Oman LNG. 
					The two large overheads for the company are employee salary 
					and the gas that it buys from the government. Though Maqbool 
					and his team put in a little bit more effort in containing 
					costs, this was not a big focus area. A bigger problem was 
					managing employee expectations. During the boom years of 
					2007-08 there was a significant increase in the staff 
					strength. A drastic decline posed a challenge in terms of 
					maintaining staff levels and their morale. “We were able to 
					meet the expectations of our employees with the help of our 
					Board and management,” <br>
					<br>
					says Maqbool. The company undertook a survey of various 
					possibilities and scenarios. One of them being an analysis 
					of the worst case scenario. “We looked at the pressures that 
					the company could take if oil prices went down to $35 per 
					barrel. This situation was unprecedented and we found that 
					if this scenario persisted our financials would have been 
					within acceptable limits and we would still make profits,” 
					says Maqbool.<br>
					<br>
					In the Oman LNG Board the finance function has always 
					carried a lot of weightage and the CFO’s advice is taken 
					seriously. During such unprecedented times, a focus on 
					financial matters got a lot of support from all quarters.
					<br>
					<br>
					The company could never imagine that oil prices would 
					plummet from all time highs so rapidly. “Though we felt that 
					$140 per barrel prices were unsustainable, people were 
					talking about oil prices going to $200-$300 per barrel, but 
					the sudden decline came as a shock.” This sudden fall had a 
					ripple effect as it impacted the real estate market and 
					financial institutions. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Uncertain times</b><br>
					<br>
					The global scenario is still quite unstable as interest 
					rates are fluctuating constantly. “The outlook on interest 
					rates three to six months ago was quite different from 
					today. On the demand side things are stabilising. Some South 
					East Asian Economies are showing signs of positive growth 
					but Japan has some issues and Europe and the US are still 
					struggling.”<br>
					Companies which have borrowed money would like to have a 
					clearer outlook on interest rates. But due to the crisis the 
					normal rules relating to business and finance do not hold 
					much ground. As past business cycles were completely 
					different, the guidance in forecast has moved down 
					international interest rates. In the first quarter of 2009 
					interest rate on deposits were anywhere between three to 
					four per cent. Today it is around 1.25 per cent to one per 
					cent. <br>
					Oman LNG distributes a significant part of its profits to 
					its shareholders like the government, Shell and Total. The 
					company keeps local securities ranging from three to six 
					months, but has no long term cash. Oman and the Gulf 
					countries were fortunate as their exposure to international 
					financial cross currents were limited. Says Maqbool, “LNG as 
					gas is the future as it is a clean fuel and is environment 
					friendly. The prevailing prices of $70-80 per barrel is 
					comfortable. While $140 per barrel was too much anything 
					below $60 per barrel would be a concern. The current 
					forecast for Oman LNG is pretty good.” Since its 
					establishment in 1994, Oman LNG has progressed from a 
					project under-construction to a world class company, 
					liquefying natural gas in its plant at Qalhat in Oman and 
					exporting it to international markets all over the world. 
					Oman LNG harnesses cutting edge technology to provide the 
					world with a purer source of energy, while contributing to 
					the sustainable development of the Sultanate <br>
					of Oman.<br>

					<br>
					</b>TheThe global financial downturn was precipitated by the 
					sub-prime mortgage crisis and as a consequence the global 
					real estate sector faced the financial tremors across 
					continents. Says Phil Beale, CFO, The Wave, Muscat, “The 
					global financial crisis created uncertainty in the minds of 
					potential investors and the depth of the crisis was 
					something that had never been seen before.” The lack of a 
					legislative framework and appropriate response mechanisms 
					globally to deal with such an eventuality made things worse. 
					As the liquidity squeeze took hold, investors threw up their 
					hands in despair as they did not know where their next 
					installment was going to come from. “In Dubai, where I was 
					working at the time, there were instances wherein customers 
					walked away after paying deposits and installments totaling 
					more than30 per cent of the contracted price.”<br>
					<br>
					The Oman market had not increased to the same extent nor at 
					the same rate as Dubai and other regions; this meant that 
					the subsequent fall in prices was not as severe. The Wave 
					had taken prudent measures in terms of its programme and 
					financial resources and with the support of the shareholders 
					and our bank (BankMuscat) the business had enough liquidity 
					in place to come through the downturn. The backing of strong 
					promoters like the Omani government, NIFCO and the Majid Al 
					Futtaim Group (MAF) ensured stability. The response to the 
					crisis for The Wave was implemented quickly and effectively 
					due to the experience, prudence, and strong governance 
					measures that were established in The Wave from inception.<br>
					<br>
					Says Beale, “We did not make any new off plan sales in 2009; 
					the focus was on helping existing customers to get credit 
					wherever needed and to provide other advice and services 
					where possible to assist them.” During 2010, The Wave has 
					released 168 properties to date and has sold out nearly all 
					of them. Initially in the wake of the crisis, some banks 
					insisted on buyers paying up to 40 per cent of cash upfront 
					for a loan, others withdrew temporarily from the market. “We 
					talked to banks and introduced the bank to our customers. As 
					a developer our role is not to plead with banks to support 
					our customers and the project. Our role is to put the 
					customer and the bank together, if needed, so that our 
					customers can procure the loans they require.” <br>
					<br>
					During 2009, we also helped our customers sell their 
					properties if they chose to, though this was not always easy 
					given the then prevailing market conditions. “People had to 
					be patient as it was difficult to sell properties, at times 
					it took upto six months to find a buyer,” says Beale. Other 
					assistance was given to some of our customers who had 
					acquired property just prior to the global financial crisis 
					where possible to assist them in being able to continue with 
					the property ownership. Our customer service area worked 
					with each individual customer who requested assistance.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Price cuts versus market positioning</b><br>
					<br>
					Oman saw prices fall on an average of 20 per cent. “Unlike 
					Dubai where prices were shaved by 40-50 per cent or more in 
					the worst case, in Oman the price reductions overall were 
					much smaller.”<br>
					<br>
					The response by The Wave to the new market conditions saw 
					the development of new product lines that maintained the 
					integrity and quality of the development but targeted at 
					specific pricing points to meet the market. With the 
					property development experience available at The Wave new 
					products were designed that “met the market” in terms of 
					price without affecting the quality or style of the 
					development. Effective market positioning is a more 
					effective response than price cutting which erodes value in 
					the long term for The Wave. The developer has assured 
					existing buyers that the specifications of the new 
					properties would be at the same standard as their’s. The 
					Wave has a lot of development expertise which was used to 
					understand the market and to come to a decision through 
					senior management and the Board that has enabled The Wave to 
					maintain its position. <br>
					<br>
					Looking globally the role of the CFO did not change in a 
					major way. The CFO came under more pressure as he had to 
					micro manage aspects of the business and understand in more 
					detail what was occurring. “If there was a cash flow problem 
					then certain decisions had to be taken whether to defer or 
					cut something for now to preserve capital and enterprise 
					value, The CFO also had to look at ways of raising capital.” 
					A crisis like this tests the system.” In good times while 
					any gaps in the system may get glossed over in times of 
					crisis such lacunae come to the fore. The CFO along with the 
					CEO has to instill confidence in the team. “The finance 
					function is the glue that binds an organisation together. 
					The Dubai experience was one of constant meetings with 
					contractors and others to instill confidence. The experience 
					at The Wave was business as usual due to The Wave’s strong 
					position.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Cost cutting </b><br>
					<br>
					The Wave reviewed all discretionary expenditure. For 
					instance things such as software upgrades were put on hold, 
					other expenses such as travel minimised and only essential 
					expenditure made. The marketing staff was redeployed for 
					reselling properties or for collecting payments. On the 
					whole as The Wave ran a lean business, there were no 
					retrenchments. The silver lining was that commodity prices 
					came down, which eased the pressure on construction costs. 
					Overall, as The Wave had a strong financial position it 
					could ride over the problems without much pain. <br>
					<br>
					Looking ahead Beale feels that things will be slow in the 
					global real estate market for the next two years as there 
					are concerns about a double dip recession. The position in 
					Oman appears to be more positive and the economy strong so 
					the market here is expected to continue.<br>
					<br>
					Though things are improving in the US and Europe people have 
					still not started hiring and unemployment levels in the US 
					remain at historic highs. Says Beale, “Property is a long 
					term asset and in difficult times people may prefer to rent 
					rather than buy and so it may take longer for the sector to 
					get back on its feet. This opens up opportunities for 
					property investors if they have confidence in the markets.” 
					China and India are growing at a fast pace but they are 
					unlikely to have a big impact on the global economy as they 
					are internalising i.e. their growth is being driven by 
					infrastructure spending and domestic consumption. Oman too 
					is following a similar approach. If a double dip scenario 
					were to materialise it could extend project completion 
					schedules further. On the other hand property prices have 
					bottomed out so it may be a good time for serious buyers to 
					look at the real estate market. <br>
					<br>
					Beale feels that the size of the fall is something that the 
					people will remember for a long time to come. The 
					psychological impact will wane away and things will improve 
					if inflation continues to remain low. Being cynical, two to 
					three years after a crash people tend to forget about it and 
					go back to their bad old ways. But for now people have 
					definitely learnt about prudence and the ills of too much 
					speculation. In certain things people are going back to core 
					values like thrift and calibrated spending. How long this 
					will last only time will tell. Despite the downturn the 
					regional story is still intact. The GCC has a young 
					population and is expected to reap a demographic dividend. 
					Secondly, the region is looking beyond hydrocarbons and is 
					investing in tourism. The geographic location of the Gulf 
					means that it has potential to become a value add hub. All 
					this augurs well for real estate developments <br>
					like The Wave.<br>

					</b>I From the early days of his career Manohar Shenoy, 
					Group CFO, W J Towell and Company has been a firm believer 
					in the adage –- sales is vanity; profit is sanity and cash 
					is reality. Though this global crisis was not a depression, 
					it came pretty close to it and the fundamental premise that 
					stood out was that cash is king, perhaps even god!<br>
					<br>
					Looking at the reasons for the crisis and its impact, Shenoy 
					says, on a global basis there was a sudden shock with oil 
					prices falling from $147 per barrel (dpb) in July 2008 to 
					$39dpd in January 2009. Anything that goes up so fast is 
					bound to fall. There is usually a lead and lag effect in 
					economic cycles. An economy is considered to be in a 
					recession if there are two sequential quarters of negative 
					growth. A sudden drop in oil prices, the collapse of real 
					estate demand and the after effects of the US subprime 
					crisis affected the Sultanate. Globally, the recession broke 
					in Q4, 2007, but due to the lead and lag effect it came to 
					Oman in Q3,2008.<br>
					Real estate prices peaked in Q2,2008, but by the end of the 
					year valuations had fallen from that peak by upto 15 per 
					cent in some interiors and continued to fall till the end of 
					2009 .<br>
					<br>
					During this period, banks became wary about lending to real 
					estate companies. Despite this, W J Towell came out 
					unscatched due to a number of reasons. First of all, it is a 
					conservative group and has stood rock steady across business 
					cycles for the last 150 years. Secondly, the W J Towell 
					parent company is not into buying and selling of property 
					but follows a prudent build and lease model. Says Shenoy, 
					“Leasing income is our real income. The value of property 
					going up and down does not impact our cash flows as we have 
					stable rental flows.<br>
					<br>
&nbsp;The bulk of our residential and commercial properties are in Madinat as 
					Sultan Qaboos (MQ), and since it is a prestigious location 
					it has not been impacted to the same extent as other areas. 
					In any case, it appears that property prices have bottomed 
					and are slowly but surely seeing an uptick”<br>
					W J Towell Group is underpinned by the single obligor clause 
					applicable to lending by Omani banks. No Omani bank is 
					allowed to lend more than 15 per cent of its net worth to 
					any group. Any stand-alone company in which the group mother 
					company has more than 25 per cent or more shares is also 
					considered to be a part of the group for lending purposes. 
					“A group’s debt ceiling is defined by the Omani bank’s net 
					worth, so if I have reached that limit then no group company 
					is able to borrow more from that bank.” says Shenoy. The 
					single obligor clause forced W J Towell to go to 
					international banks (western and GCC based) for funding its 
					organic growth requirements. Thanks to the easy money policy 
					of the US Fed, dollar liquidity became a boon. LIBOR came 
					down from 5.7 per cent in September 2007 to less than 1 per 
					cent in early 2009 and only 0.3 per cent today. Overseas 
					borrowing came in handy for W J Towell as the group could 
					borrow from local banks only if the latter increased their 
					net worth or if they had a share capital infusion. In 
					2008-09 a number of new banks like Qatar National Bank, Ahli 
					Bank, Bank Sohar came up in Oman which along with banks like 
					Habib Bank and Bank of Beirut also participated in the 
					company’s funding and non-funding needs. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Shorter cycles<br>
					</b><br>
					Shenoy says, “In a downturn your working capital cycle has 
					to shrink. It is a test when you have pressure on markets 
					and your finished products.” In Oman, businesses were stuck 
					with huge inventories as the demand was low and banks were 
					not lending. As the malaise cut across a number of large 
					business houses, banks could not afford to ask all of them 
					to pay up. As a result banks extended letters of credit (LCs) 
					helping companies. Despite problems the group ended the year 
					with good numbers. The erosion of real estate values 
					impacted the ability of companies to borrow. This was 
					compounded when banks simultaneously increased the security 
					cover for their lending by upto 50 per cent in some cases. 
					This increased the pressure as companies did not have 
					additional collateral. Since W J Towell has a sufficient 
					bank of freehold properties, it was able to keep its debt at 
					the same levels, even borrow more for its property 
					redevelopment programmes, particularly in MQ. <br>
					<br>
					Shenoy feels that one needs to balance one’s short term and 
					long term loans. “We have been conservative and have not 
					used real estate as a tradable asset. And as they say real 
					estate is the only real thing and everything else, other 
					than cash, is “unreal”. As a number of its properties were 
					initially developed in the 1970s, the group felt the need to 
					redevelop them in accordance with new sensibilities. In the 
					past, the land area that Muscat Municipality allowed to be 
					developed was small, as a result of which the houses were 
					fewer. As the population of Oman increased the concerned 
					authorities allowed almost 50 per cent larger areas to be 
					developed. In another related change, the Municipality also 
					started allowing higher vertical construction. In MQ, for 
					example, the new rules permitted ground plus three stories 
					and in areas like Ghala ground plus nine stories. “Thus it 
					made good sense for us to redevelop and build new 
					properties. We relocated some of our tenants and rebuilt to 
					capitalise on the new norms,” says Shenoy. <br>
					<br>
					Though the plans for this redevelopment was drawn up before 
					the crisis, the group did not have to go in for a major 
					rescheduling of any of its projects as liquidity concerns 
					never posed a problem. The architects for the redevelopment 
					are Towell Talati and close to 300 apartments, showrooms, 
					offices and a few warehouses are under redevelopment.<br>
					Apart from real estate W J Towell also has a big 
					distribution business, which also remained largely insulated 
					from the slowdown. Says Shenoy, “We are in the FMCG business 
					which is recession proof. We are not in branded perfumery or 
					luxury items which get affected by a downturn. Our companies 
					like Matrah Cold Stores and the Consumer Products Division 
					supply to supermarkets and hypermarkets essential 
					commodities.” Due to a big pipeline of captive and 
					third-party projects, the group’s construction and 
					engineering subsidiaries have seen robust improvements in 
					their cash flows, as well as in their business performances.<br>
					<br>
					During the crisis, the finance function became more 
					centralised as W J Towell agreed with bankers that any 
					discussion relating to finance had to be done at the group 
					level rather than its subsidiaries. A centralised Investment 
					Committee was drawn up to take decisions regarding any new 
					investment, including any selective disinvestments of 
					non-strategic assets. The group is well poised to benefit 
					from MA opportunities as well as grow organically over the 
					next decade.<br>
					<br>
					The W J Towell Group believes in loyalty and commitment of 
					its employees and the owners enjoy a lot of goodwill in the 
					market with regard to its business practices which it has 
					nurtured over the last nearly 150 years of its existence. 
					“The recovery is going to be a U shaped one and will depend 
					on how the West is faring as oil prices are correlated to 
					the sentiment of the western world,” says Shenoy. He adds, 
					the learning from the crisis is that whether the times are 
					good or bad, it is important for us to have a pipeline of 
					projects and orders across our businesses. Companies may 
					shrink their cash cycle and tighten their belts as it is 
					good for them, but if everyone does the same then it can 
					have negative repercussions collectively for the economy, 
					particularly as it is recovering from a slowdown.<br>

					recession, most companies focus on cutting costs; however, 
					history has proven that winners made disproportionate 
					investments in talent, marketing, R&amp;D and capital spending 
					at exactly such times, says Vishal Goenka, CFO, Renaissance 
					Services</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					</font> 
					<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
					</b>Hardly In all emerging economies like Brazil, India, 
					China, etc, the role of the CFO is becoming more prominent. 
					His role is no longer limited to the traditional book 
					keeping function. Says Vishal Goenka, CFO, Renaissance 
					Services, “Finance simply means fine sense. Thus, a CFO’s 
					profile requires a person with extremely fine sense. As you 
					think so you become. Think human, think business, think 
					prudent. Success is all about consistency around the 
					fundamentals. Life favours the devoted. Behind extraordinary 
					achievement there is always an extra-ordinary effort.” <br>
					<br>
					Renaissance has always been nimble and prepared for all 
					seasons, companies can’t predict the future, but they can 
					build organisations that will survive and flourish under 
					just about any possible future. The group has a number of 
					businesses out of which some are capital intensive while 
					others are less capital intensive. “If you are stable you 
					can move forward and keep investing in your core businesses; 
					thinking long term is difficult if your company’s survival 
					is at stake. Our agile approach helped us to prepare for 
					such a contingency and this approach is an integral part of 
					the philosophy of the group. A CFO has to think prudently 
					and to think business,” says Goenka. He further suggests 
					that businesses need to get their breakeven point down so 
					that, no matters what happens to the industry worldwide, 
					they can be successful.<br>
					<br>
					As a thumb rule, people like to do business with people whom 
					they like and are comfortable with. When the crisis hit 
					home, banks were forced to select a couple of companies whom 
					they could continue to lend in a downturn due to liquidity 
					and solvency concerns. Such a filtration process helped 
					Renaissance as the innate confidence that banks had in the 
					company’s business model saw the company raising capital 
					without a hitch. In 2008-H1-2010, at peak of the crisis, 
					Renaissance managed to invest around $500mn with full 
					participation from local, regional and international banks. 
					The company banks with over 25 banks across countries. Says 
					Goenka, “Business is a relationship; people want to know 
					that you are real, decent, kind and trustworthy. And when 
					they sense that you are the real deal, they will open up to 
					you. Before someone lends you a hand, you need to touch 
					their heart.” <br>
					<br>
					As a policy, the company tries not to be over reliant on a 
					single source of funding. The fact that the company has a 
					presence in 16 countries, with different kind of projects, 
					also necessitates a diverse funding base. Whenever the 
					company enters a new market and project it makes an effort 
					to match its liabilities and assets. <br>
					<br>
					There were a number of people and leading companies who 
					borrowed for the short term and then deployed these funds 
					for long term investment. The temptation to do this arises 
					as short term loans are cheaper than long term loans. For 
					instance, a short term loan costs around four per cent while 
					a long term loan may come at six per cent plus. “You need to 
					match your asset profile to your loans and we have 
					consciously tried to match our cash flows with our repayment 
					needs. If you look at our projects whether they are vessels 
					or PACs they generate sufficient cash flows to repay the 
					matching liabilities in five to six years while our loans 
					are generally more than that period,” says Goenka. <br>
					<br>
					He feels that wherever you find problems it is because there 
					is a mismatch between cash flows and liabilities, but after 
					the global financial crisis most businesses have realised 
					that they need to be more prudent and long term in their 
					thinking. <br>
					<br>
					<b>The challenges</b><br>
					<br>
					Renaissance has had a pretty good run despite the crisis, 
					though the company’s engineering business felt some 
					short-term impact of recession, but the impact was marginal 
					in the company’s marine services and contract businesses, 
					which contribute to around 80 per cent of its turnover. The 
					fact that oil prices have recovered from their lows and has 
					been trading above $70 per barrel augurs well for the future 
					for all companies in the oil and gas industry. <br>
					<br>
					The company’s engineering business, which is among the top 
					25 EPC contractors in the Middle East, felt slight tremors 
					as the ship repair and ship building business got affected 
					and orders on the fabrication side were slow to come by. The 
					silver lining was that the company had a good order backlog 
					during the crisis period which helped it to tide over the 
					crisis. The fact that the engineering business is less 
					capital intensive helped it to continue making money through 
					the crisis and now the engineering business has started 
					picking up as well. “If you look at our business model you 
					see that 75 per cent of our revenue and cash flow are long 
					term. Only 25 per cent of our revenues come from short term 
					contracts. We have long term contracts in our PAC and in our 
					vessels business, so our revenue model is secure; and our 
					clientele includes reputed blue chip firms like BP, Shell, 
					Total, PDO etc,” says Goenka. <br>
					<br>
					In anticipation of the severity of the crisis, Renaissance 
					did a stress test at all levels – the company assessed each 
					revenue stream, put emphasis on collectability and 
					investment in the long term rather than the short term. The 
					company never went in for speculative gains and looked at 
					each of its overheads to optimise costs. As a result of 
					these it was able to make savings; in fact during the first 
					quarter of 2010 there was an improvement in margins and 
					profitability. “The stress test also included a stringent 
					test on our billing pattern. We focused on good revenues 
					during the crisis because it became really critical. In 
					difficult times you need to be confident that your revenues 
					are collectible,” says Goenka. <br>
					<br>
					Inaction is the riskiest response to the uncertainties of an 
					economic crisis, but rash or scattershot action can be 
					nearly as damaging. Irrespective of the external 
					environment, the company does a quarter-to-quarter cost 
					optimisation assessment, a simple example; wherever 
					possible, it reduces travelling expenses by using video 
					conferencing as a cost cutting device. Such meticulous 
					planning and innovation helps the company to optimise 
					savings. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Enhanced mandate </b><br>
					<br>
					The crisis also called upon CFOs to take on a bigger role in 
					instilling confidence amongst employees. The company 
					designed a communication strategy wherein it proactively 
					shared the challenges to its employees, shareholders, 
					bankers, clients, suppliers etc. <br>
					<br>
					Looking back, Goenka says that what was happening in some of 
					the markets gave us a feeling of anxiety, but no one knew 
					that things would turn out to be so abysmally low. The 
					sequence of failures in the US, Europe and then in our 
					neighbouring countries created a lot of nervousness in the 
					market, but things are more controllable now, in the last 
					six months. There has been some thawing, visibility has 
					improved, banks are opening up, people are more optimistic 
					and the energy outlook is better. <br>
					<br>
					The CFO plays two distinct but equally important roles. 
					First, he must be a good strategic partner to line 
					management. This part of the job usually involves financial 
					structuring, inorganic opportunities and managing investors 
					relations etc. He must also deal with external 
					constituencies like consultants, bankers, analysts, 
					investors, competitors etc. This role makes him the 
					company’s ambassador to the outside world. The second part 
					of his job is equally critical, that is the traditional 
					policing role – the CFO as cop must be the guardian, the 
					leader of good planning and performance management. Today 
					business fundamentals and creditable accounting have become 
					the new touchstone by which investors judge corporate 
					quality.<br>
					<br>
					The CFO also needs to create value by pulling together cross 
					functional teams in the organisation to really think about 
					how to drive productivity and efficiency, how we can 
					allocate resources and where we can find more value in the 
					business. He should work as a net exporter of talent to the 
					rest of the group, says Goenka.<br>

					Hafidh Al-Harthy, finance manager and secretary to the Board 
					of Directors, Qalhat LNG (QLNG) is a firm believer in 
					following fundamentals. “A lot of organisations ignored the 
					very basics of business/risk management and suffered severe 
					consequences of the global financial crisis,” he says. These 
					basics being – not putting all your eggs in one basket; high 
					returns equal high risks so it is important to know your 
					risks and to be prepared for the consequences; take 
					calculated risks to succeed and finally cash is king and in 
					a difficult year like 2008 cash was akin to God. A business 
					can be very successful in generating good returns but if 
					cash is not properly managed its creditors can shut it down.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Steady growth </b><br>
					<br>
					Says Hafidh, “QLNG has never ventured into the unknown, but 
					we picked everything on our way that wets our risk appetite 
					to generate additional value for our business; of course 
					this did not come without risks as we always believed that 
					nothing ventured is nothing gained.” QLNG is highly geared 
					with 90 per cent of its funds being financed by a syndicate 
					of local, regional and international banks. But this has 
					been done at very attractive terms and significantly low 
					pricing. The project was completed in 2005 and it started 
					operations at the beginning of 2006. It is counted as a 
					landmark not only within Oman or the region but also at an 
					international level. <br>
					<br>
					The success story started right from the beginning and it 
					went onto achieve significant milestones on its way like:<br>
					The project was completed before time and well below budget 
					in line with global benchmarks. This did away with the need 
					for additional cash flow for cost overruns. On the contrary, 
					the company drew a lot less cash from the loan facilities 
					than the commitment that it had signed with the banks.<br>
					<br>
					As a consequence, QLNG was able to go back to its lenders 
					and renegotiate the pricing structure of its loans and it 
					successfully managed to lower interest rates substantially. 
					At today’s money market rates, this is almost zilch.<br>
					<br>
					In addition to lower draw downs from the loan, the project 
					started to generate more cash than initially projected, an 
					early start-up translated into production before the due 
					date. As a result more cash was generated than what was 
					needed for the business which helped the company to pay 100 
					per cent of distributable profits to its shareholders as 
					dividends.<br>
					<br>
					The loan facility that was signed with the banks is 
					repayable over 14 years but in the very first year of 
					repayment (2007) the company prepaid (accelerated repayment) 
					almost 26 per cent ($140mn) of its total loan. In 2008, when 
					the whole world was suffering from cash flow problems, it 
					went ahead and surprised its lenders with another prepayment 
					of 11 per cent (or $60mn), which meant that more than a 
					third of the loan was repaid in the very first two years of 
					the 14 years loan tenor, and the company now does not have 
					to make any scheduled loan repayments until 2013.<br>
					<br>
					To achieve 90 per cent gearing the project needed to have 
					sufficient long term sales agreement in place to make the 
					project bankable, and this is what QLNG did, as it sold 
					almost 90 per cent of its long term capacity. Says Hafidh, 
					“We could have easily clasped our hands and continued 
					fulfilling our committed sales agreement and got what was 
					forecasted in the economic model that was used during the 
					Final Investment Decision (FID). However, we did not sit on 
					our laurels but applied ourselves to reviewing every 
					opportunity that could arbitrage those long term deals 
					(without additional production) and generate more value with 
					minimal additional risks.” Hence QLNG ventured into 
					re-trading its already sold volumes to higher paying markets 
					and procured resupplies for its long term commitments. This 
					generated a significant upside not only for our bottomline 
					but this was shared with our long term buyers, the 
					government as feed stock supplier and with the shareholders.<br>
					<br>
					The company, as is customary in the oil and gas industry of 
					Oman, took a right decision at the beginning of operations 
					to set aside one per cent of its net income for Social 
					Security Funding, hence the additional revenue generated 
					from the arbitrage activities also contributed to community 
					funding. “What we have achieved as a responsible corporate 
					citizen in this area is beyond imagination and speaks for 
					itself,” says Hafidh.<br>
					<br>
					As energy prices were going through the roof in 2008, QLNG 
					approached its long term buyers to review the already agreed 
					pricing formulae. This was also done to support the 
					government in increasing its revenue. As a result the 
					company achieved substantial improvement in its pricing 
					formulae for its long term sales, almost all of this is 
					being passed to the government as an increase in feed stock 
					prices.<br>
					<br>
					QLNG has constructed its own state-of-the-art building in 
					Airport heights where it has moved in recently. Financing of 
					this project was also done from internally generated funds.
					<br>
					<br>
					Says Hafidh, “In spite of meeting all our payment 
					obligations including accelerating loan repayments, meeting 
					our dividend expectations, financing our new office 
					building, we still are building up significant surplus cash. 
					So our problem is not lack of cash but what to do with the 
					surplus cash.” So far the company had been investing its 
					surpluses in fixed deposits with banks internationally but 
					over the last few years it has over weighted its local 
					deposits slightly to support local banks, the economy and 
					the local markets liquidity. As a matter of policy QLNG 
					never ventured into stocks and bonds and thus escaped the 
					adverse consequences faced by organisations which had such 
					exposure. In an effort to deploy its cash surplus, the 
					company once again convinced its Board and shareholders to 
					take private equity in projects related to the energy 
					sector. “The projects in the energy sector tend to be stable 
					and it is an industry that we understand best.”<br>
					<br>
					As a start, QLNG has taken a 10 per cent equity in a power 
					plant in Japan. The LNG major has been a trendsetter of 
					sorts as it was the first foreign investor ever to enter the 
					Japanese energy sector. Moreover, although the investment 
					was effective from December 2008 it has already received 
					significant dividend returns from this investment. Says 
					Hafidh, “we are looking for more opportunities in this 
					sector whether locally in Oman, regionally or 
					internationally in projects where risks are low with 
					moderate returns, and we welcome anyone who may be 
					interested in having us as their partners. Cash is not issue 
					if the proposal can wet our appetite.” That is a proposition 
					that few are going to resist.<br>

					<br>
					Though times may be difficult but people continue to talk 
					and this has proved to be a comforting factor for Nawras 
					during the global downturn. Says Jorgen Latte, CFO, Nawras, 
					“We were fortunately not affected by the recent global 
					financial crisis continually growing successfully despite 
					the economic slowdown in other parts of the world. Funding 
					for our ongoing ventures was possible due to the excellent 
					relations that we had with our banks.”<br>
					<br>
					The telecom major has consistently shown a strong 
					performance clocking impressive financial results with 
					increasing numbers of customers choosing its pleasingly 
					different services to meet their evolving communication 
					needs. In keeping with good business practices the company 
					has always kept a close eye on expenses. Nawras kept a close 
					eye on costs including all purchase decisions in even 
					greater detail, as news of the world economic slump became 
					known. <br>
					<br>
					Says Latte, “The role of a CFO is always a multi-faceted one 
					and as a member of the executive team at Nawras I do take a 
					keen interest in all areas of the business. Company 
					decisions are made after considering the marketing, 
					financial, commercial and technical aspects of our business. 
					Communicating clearly with my team and the rest of the 
					Nawras family is important and I am always open to ideas and 
					suggestions that can contribute positively to improve our 
					performance further. The open plan style of seating favoured 
					by Nawras is conducive to a frank and frequent exchange of 
					information.”<br>
					<br>
					<b>Business cycle </b><br>
					<br>
					While no one had an inkling of the latest financial crisis 
					before it hit the world stage Latte feels that one always 
					needs to be prepared for declines or dips in business 
					conditions. “I would always be looking for prudent business 
					practices to be practiced even when the economy is booming 
					and times are good.”<br>
					<br>
					The good news is that Oman was largely unaffected by the 
					global financial woes, there was little need of recovery and 
					economic signs are looking good. As an Omani company, Nawras 
					has continued to grow its business, recently becoming a full 
					service provider and a one-stop shop for business and 
					residential customers in Oman be it mobile or fixed, 
					broadband or voice. Latte signs off, “Good financial 
					management is always important and you should not wait for a 
					crisis situation to get your house in order.”<br>

				<img border="0" src="images/sep_cover6.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0; " align="right"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b><br>
					</b><br>
					Zubair Automotive rewrote the rules of the book during the 
					global financial crisis by launching one of the biggest 
					discount offers as a dealership. Says C S Badrinath, CFO, 
					The Zubair Corporation, “We are working in an uncertain 
					environment. This is a part of the business cycle that 
					happens every five to six years. Moreover, since this 
					downturn came on the back of strong growth witnessed in 
					2007-2008 the delta effect was much more sharp. It was 
					sudden and more severe than before. The second challenge was 
					that there was a lot of uncertainty, and this was more of a 
					financial crisis rather than a business crisis. The 
					environment in which banks operated became difficult and as 
					they came under pressure they clamped upon others raising 
					liquidity concerns. Banks started to reduce credit lines.”<br>
					<br>
					<b>Lending support </b><br>
					<br>
					The silver lining was that despite their concerns, banks 
					continued to support businesses in the Sultanate and 
					principals like Mitsubishi, Dodge, Audi etc stood by their 
					distributors. The latter stemmed from the fact that though 
					principals had their own set of problems to grapple with, 
					they realised that the Middle East was one area that was 
					providing them with some opportunity and they had to support 
					the region in a better way. The fact that distributors were 
					left holding large inventories also made it imperative to 
					back the Middle East dealers. Realising the gravity of the 
					situation, principals started giving credit extensions.<br>
					<br>
					In the automotive sector there was a sharp rise in business 
					during 2006-08 which was immediately followed by a steep 
					fall. The demand was going down and psychologicallycustomers 
					were shaken. There was a knock on effect as funding lines 
					got squeezed and purchase decisions were postponed. The 
					automobile business has its own set of constraints that 
					aggravated matters. The business has a long forecasting and 
					delivery schedule. “Due to a stretched lead time if you 
					place an order at the time of manufacture and demand slows 
					down, then one is left holding large inventories,” says 
					Badrinath. <br>
					<br>
					Faced with this predicament, the group decided to go in for 
					aggressive marketing to liquidate its stocks. “In 2008 our 
					carrying cost was high, the choice was to hold onto our 
					inventory for a longer period of time and to endure the 
					pain, make our principals unhappy or to endure short term 
					pain and then to refocus.” <br>
					<br>
					While some models have a natural pull for customers, others 
					needed a certain amount of push in the shape of discounts, 
					incentives etc. Says Badrinath, “We were the first ones to 
					take an aggressive stance by going in for push driven 
					marketing. The market reacted positively to the move and we 
					came out stronger.” The discounting has raised customer 
					expectations but once things are back to normal they would 
					need to adjust themselves to the new reality. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Fleeting impact </b><br>
					<br>
					Apart from the automobile business the group was not 
					impacted similarly in its other lines of business. The 
					hospitality business saw a marginal knockout effect, but in 
					the oil and gas sector it was business as usual.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
					The pressure started mounting in the last quarter of 2008 
					after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. In 
					a globalised market the aftermath of the collapse of 
					institutions like Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and so on had an 
					impact on the banking scenario. Banks became wary of lending 
					not knowing where the next default is going to come from.<br>
					<br>
					Says Badrinath, “The main job of banks is to lend, and 
					despite the problems local banks did support the local 
					companies during Q’4, 2008 and Q’1 and Q’2 of 2009. Being a 
					big conglomerate The Zubair Group has relations with 
					regional and international banks. This in turn affected 
					credit lines as these banks had liquidity issues.” There is 
					a subtle difference between banking with local and 
					international banks. With local banks there is a 
					relationship based approach as they are stakeholders in 
					operations, but with international banks the relationship in 
					more impersonal. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Business planning <br>
					</b><br>
					Talking about planning Badrinath says, the planning scenario 
					is determined by market conditions as business is a cycle in 
					which things move up and down. As and when the business goes 
					down, staff strength gets rationalised accordingly. The CFO 
					has an HR role as he has to do a lot of communication. 
					Looking at costs is a natural part of a CFO’s role, “We look 
					at the MIS on a monthly basis in management committee 
					meetings. We have a working capital cycle and the effort is 
					to ease the pressure on the cycle, this is done through 
					debate and discussions. <br>
					<br>
					It is a continuous process and we continued the process 
					during the downturn.” The group uses forecasting tools to 
					gauge future demand, but it is difficult to place a finger 
					on demand exactly in the short run.<br>
					<br>
					As a part of the corporate structure people are made aware 
					of the prevalent situation and they are a part of the joint 
					efforts to work on the situation. “As a CFO we do wave the 
					red flag whenever the need is felt for it. In the past also 
					we have had downturns but since this drop took place after 
					two years of robust growth, the impact felt was much 
					sterner. The speed and frequency of collapse of some global 
					players was a huge shock and the psychological impact 
					created by such events made sure that people who would 
					otherwise change cars every three to five years postponed 
					their decision.”<br>
					<br>
					Badrinath is not sure whether people will be more 
					intelligent to avoid a crisis next time around. “The Middle 
					East region is a different market compared to other parts of 
					the world as countries in the region are closed and inward 
					looking. Second, compared to international cross currents 
					more weightage is given to local factors like development 
					contracts, government spending etc.” With the oil outlook 
					looking positive, the airport project and other developments 
					in Duqm, he is confident that the positive effects will rub 
					off on business. The local liquidity has gone up and 
					corporates have come to a subnormal capital cycle, with the 
					situation becoming more comfortable.<br>
					<br>
					Getting decisions right in a crisis period becomes that much 
					more imperative. It becomes important to motivate the staff, 
					work together as a team and to win over adverse 
					circumstances to come out successful. The CFO’s role should 
					be to avoid knee-jerk reactions to economic swings. It all 
					goes down to getting the basics right – “The problems 
					started because someone wanted to gear their organisation 40 
					times. As long as you follow the standard norms things are 
					unlikely to go awry.”<br>

					</b>Omran is the government of Oman’s tourism development 
					and invest-ment arm. It was established in 2005 with a 
					mandate to develop the infrastructure and facilities 
					required to expand the country’s existing tourism industry 
					to support the Sultanate’s plan to develop tourism as a 
					major national industry by 2020. Strangely, Omran has lived 
					a double life through the crisis. Being a government 
					organisation, it has had no liquidity concerns of its own 
					thanks to its strong equity and asset base, but in some of 
					its joint ventures it has faced issues. <br>
					<br>
					Omran is developing the Oman Convention and Exhibition 
					Centre; the Asian Beach Games complex; Fort Hotel; Muscat 
					City Hotels; Duqum Beach Hotel; Khasab Hotel, and the Jabal 
					Akhdar Hotel on its own. In addition to these it has entered 
					into many joint ventures with various other partners to 
					develop ITC’s, resorts and hotels. For example, Yiti project 
					is being done in partnership with Sama Dubai; Ras Al Hadd 
					Resort is a joint venture with the Qatari Diar Real Estate 
					Investment Company; Saraya Bandar Jissah is being developed 
					with Saraya and Muriya Tourism Development a joint venture 
					between Omran and Orascom Hotels and Development is 
					developing Jebel Sifah and Salalah Beach, Al Sadah Island. 
					Omran owns 4 operational hotels InterContinental Muscat, 
					Swiss Belhotel Masirah, Golden Tulip Khasab and Diba and 
					also asset manage and supervise Al Bustan Hotel and Oman 
					Dive Center on behalf of Government. All Omran projects are 
					running on time and are at various stages. Asian Beach Games 
					is going ahead as per the schedule and will be delivered on 
					time. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Making a difference</b><br>
					<br>
					Says Prakash Gabra, CFO, Omran, “The government is keen on 
					not delaying any project.” Keeping this goal in mind the 
					company has initiated a slew of measures to mitigate 
					problems. We are building 12 hotels in Oman and have got 
					financing for all of them and most of these projects are 
					funded by 100 per cent equity. <br>
					<br>
					After banks started showing reluctance for financing real 
					estate projects, Omran and our joint venture partners 
					differentiated its real estate and tourism components of the 
					projects. Thus bank funding for hotel projects in Jebel 
					Sifah and Salalah Beach were secured easily. “Hotels have an 
					internal rate of return (IRR) of 8 to 15 per cent and are 
					seen as a secure option by banks for funding. <br>
					<br>
					In another big move, Omran infused its share of cash 
					immediately in all its joint ventures whenever our partners 
					brought in their share of equity holding. Says Gabra, “We 
					put up cash in line with our shareholding and our joint 
					venture partners were able to bring to the table their 
					commitment.” This move has ensured funding for most of 
					Omran’s joint ventures. In cases where the joint venture 
					partner has been impacted in a big way, the government is 
					looking at taking over projects completely. <br>
					<br>
					Gabra admits that despite such measures the speed of 
					projects has slowed down not because of cash shortages but 
					due to other problems like a slowdown in real estate sales. 
					“Given the situation we have little choice but to adopt a 
					wait and watch strategy. So while values and prices have 
					gone down, so have construction costs.” As construction 
					costs have fallen by 30-40 per cent, Omran is hopeful that 
					its joint venture partners will quicken the pace of their 
					projects, giving a jumpstart to the market. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Enviable state</b><br>
					<br>
					Omran has had a problem of plenty on its hand. Due to its 
					frenzied growth in the last two years the company has been 
					finding it difficult to find talent for its needs. The 
					strength of the organisation has gone up from 20 to 86 
					between 2008-2010. This has meant creating space for new 
					recruits forcing the company to shift from its old office 
					premises to a new building in Al Khywer. To cut costs it has 
					reduced entitlements like travelling allowances etc. <br>
					<br>
					Gabra who was the first employee to be recruited at Omran 
					has always been an important figure in the company. Looking 
					ahead he is unsure about the time that it is going to take 
					for the real estate market to pick up. “It depends on Dubai 
					and the rebound in the regional markets. The prices of real 
					estate properties though have stabilised.”<br>
					<br>
					In the initial phase Ministry of Tourism was targeting 
					European tourists, but with Europe being impacted by the 
					sub-prime crisis and the global liquidity situation, the 
					focus has now shifted to attracting Asian and GCC buyers 
					also. Recently an official represetative for Oman tourism 
					office has been appointed for the Indian market as well. 
					Oman as a destination is being promoted in Malaysia, 
					Thailand and other South East Asian countries. Oman Air is 
					backing these efforts by starting flight connectivity to 
					these places.” <br>
					<br>
					Though demand for properties from the GCC and Europe dried 
					up, Oman was able to withstand the impact because of the 
					limited size of the ITC market. Says Gabra, “If we put 
					together all ITC’s being developed in Oman they add up to 
					20,000 residential units. So whenever the market picks up 
					these properties will sell without much trouble.”<br>
					<br>
					The real estate market has kept people guessing and Gabra is 
					not ready to place his bets on the market in the short term. 
					“It is difficult to hazard a guess as to when the market 
					would recover fully. We were hopeful that 2010 would see a 
					robust recovery, but that has not materialised, to be on the 
					safer side I would say that things should get better by 
					2011,” <br>
					says Gabra.<br>
					<br>
					Despite such a scenario, Oman has not seen much of an impact 
					as almost all projects are going ahead without a hitch. 
					Construction, infrastructure and roadwork’s are proceeding 
					apace. Spending investment has gone up. My personal 
					learning’s from the crisis have been two-fold “One sell with 
					targeted profits during the boom time and be patient during 
					recession,” <br>
					he concludes.<br>

					</b>Says Venugopal Venkatesh, CFO, Oman Oil Company, “Being 
					a project development company we are uniquely placed as we 
					invest our surplus in projects. Fortunately we have not 
					invested in any major projects in the last two years. 
					Conversely, the crisis has given us a lot of opportunities 
					to pick up assets as valuations are cheap.” Oman Oil bought 
					a good stake in a company in Eastern Europe, when the market 
					was down by around 50 per cent. The share price of the 
					company has since recovered and is trading at 75 per cent of 
					its peak value. “We are on the look-out for more 
					opportunities. The share price on the market is not a price 
					for bulk trade but for small trade and whether the kind of 
					stake that we are looking for is available is an important 
					concern. We also need to analyse the targets that we are 
					looking at and what premiums we can earn.”<br>
					<br>
					<b>Good tidings</b><br>
					<br>
					Venkatesh feels that the worst is over and that the world 
					has recovered from its lows. India and China are driving 
					this recovery but people should avoid over heated markets 
					because if something goes wrong then everything will 
					collapse. <br>
					<br>
					Oman Oil is owned by the Ministry of Finance and therefore 
					it has never faced a cash constraint. But despite this the 
					company keeps a keen eye on its overheads. Says Venkatesh, 
					“We do not have any fat. We have a plan and every manpower 
					addition is carefully thought through.” In the last two 
					years the company’s strength has gone up from 55 to 75. 
					Venkatesh narrates an example, “I need two senior 
					accountants, but I have hired only one and have been 
					managing things with him for the last seven months. 
					Everytime we get arequest for manpower upgrades, we ask – if 
					there is enough pressure on the person. If not, then he may 
					be underutilised. Being an investment company Oman Oil 
					outsources its advisory work.”<br>
					<br>
					Many of the CFOs are driven by a herd mentality. If they see 
					others doing something they feel that there is money on the 
					table that they are foregoing. A big learning from 2008-09 
					is the fact that people learnt that they needed to have more 
					equity in their company. Earlier if they were using 70-80 
					per cent leverage, now they learnt that they needed to have 
					at least 40 per cent equity. <br>
					<br>
					“In the last ten years we saw two years of extraordinary 
					growth, and that is a blip or an aberration rather than a 
					rule. People need to get used to this new normal treating 
					the 2006-08 period a euphoria. One cannot expect a huge 
					bonus every year,” says Venkatesh.<br>

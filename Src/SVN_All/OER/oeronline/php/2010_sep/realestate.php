				The question being asked is will America experience a double dip 
				recession. As the largest economy in the world, what happens in 
				the US will have a bearing on the world economy. As far as the 
				GCC countries are concerned, US is the largest consumer of oil 
				and a weak American economy will mean weak demand for oil and 
				hence lower prices.<br>
				<br>
				In most of the post-war recessions in the US, housing led the 
				economy out of recession with the housing market improving a few 
				months before the recession ended. This has not been the case in 
				the latest recession of 2008/2009. Eminent economists including 
				former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan say that the housing market 
				is key to the US avoiding a double dip recession.<br>
				<br>
				It is important to understand what happened in the last decade 
				or so to foresee what is likely to happen. Home ownership 
				increased dramatically in the US and in other developed 
				countries as mortgages were made available to all and sundry 
				without any respect to the borrower’s capacity to repay. Home 
				prices kept rising and mortgage brokers convinced lenders and 
				borrowers that the rising values alone would enable the borrower 
				to repay. <br>
				<br>
				This looks a fantasy world now but looked plausible at that 
				time. This was aided by easy money policies followed by central 
				banks in many countries with interest rates kept artificially 
				low for extended periods. (Interest rates are even lower now, 
				and near zero in the US, but the difference is that credit is 
				scarce unlike in the past). Investment banks on Wall Street 
				acted recklessly by parceling these mortgages (called subprime) 
				and selling them to innocent investors who were unaware of the 
				underlying risks.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Length of bubble</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				In the long run, demand and supply determine real estate prices 
				and prices are related to nominal income growth. However, during 
				the long period of rising prices, supply increased dramatically 
				in many countries as lenders poured in money into mortgages. The 
				length of time that a real estate asset bubble lasts determines 
				how much oversupply there will be. In the US, the property 
				bubble lasted a decade or more during which a large amount of 
				oversupply was created and in real estate once supply comes on 
				it cannot be withdrawn. The oversupply is so huge that it will 
				take many years for it to be worked off. In fact, some 
				economists are advocating demolishing whole neighbourhoods to 
				take supply off the market.<br>
				<br>
				The bubble lasted a few years in Dubai but the increase in 
				supply was very rapid and considerable excess supply got built 
				up in a short period. It will take many years for Dubai to work 
				off the excess.<br>
				<br>
				In Oman, the bubble was too brief and supply did not get built 
				up. Many large projects that were announced could be shelved 
				before they got off the ground. Therefore, in Oman while prices 
				have receded from their peak in mid 2008, there is very little 
				excess supply and hence far less pain to property developers.<br>

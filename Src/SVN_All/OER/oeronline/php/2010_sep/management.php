				‘Treat your employees like customers’, said Tom Peters who was 
				recently in Muscat to conduct a day-long seminar and promote his 
				new book ‘The Little Big Things’. The acclaimed management guru 
				talked about what corporate leaders need to do during times of 
				economic turbulence in a candid conversation with Akshay 
				Bhatnagar. Excerpts of the chat:<br>

				<b>With CEOs under increased pressure to meet shareholders 
				expectations on profit generation in the short term, how do you 
				see them investing more on their people for long term gains?</b><br>
				<br>
				Some day, God willing, those people will be 67! When you are 
				going to look into the mirror, you are not going to see 
				quarterly profits. You are going to see the people you have 
				developed. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Would you like to be someone who met Wall Street expectations 
				for 40 quarters in a row? </b><br>
				I would like to quote Richard Branson. He fundamentally said 
				that if it was not great for employees, you would go out of 
				business. <br>
				<br>
				It is not about money alone. Most of the efforts don’t cost 
				money. I’m an old Navy man and I’ll share an experience from my 
				Navy days. When Lord Nelson would take over a new fleet he would 
				change the entire character of the fleet in a month. Because he 
				had, Mandela like energy. There was respect for his sailors and 
				it was contagious. People respond to respect and appreciation 
				presumably in any market in a pretty universal way.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Many US companies continue to outsource instead of investing 
				more in their own human resources. What do you have to say about 
				them?</b><br>
				<br>
				They are bad managers. There are two kinds of outsourcing. One 
				is outsourcing for the sole purpose of minimising cost. Then 
				there is outsourcing indeed with a labour cost component but for 
				the quality of work. If you do it to reduce cost and you think 
				you are smart as you can throw them out if required, you should 
				look at partnering with them. People in US have argued loudly 
				that corporates which are outsourcing should be penalised. I 
				think it is nonsense. I think the American goal requirement as 
				it stood for any other country is to develop our own towns and 
				educational resources so that we could hold on to the jobs. If 
				you are doing it to minimise the cost, your quality will go 
				down, customer service will be affected, that’s the case. But if 
				you look at partnering in opportunity, it changes.<br>
				<br>
				<b>China is taking over large MNCs in US and European markets. 
				How is it going to impact the business leadership in these 
				companies?</b><br>
				<br>
				I was in China for three days last year. They don’t want to be 
				the workshop of the world. They want to play the value added 
				game. I told them that a nation targeting to build up 
				intellectual capital has to have a different relationship with 
				its workforce first. Though US is not like France but we have 
				tough laws in place. I told them that Americans are easy to play 
				compared to the Europeans but we are not going to accept food 
				for babies that is poisoned. Though it is not my area of 
				expertise but when China gives aid, say, to African countries 
				with no strings attached, it is worrisome. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What is your advice to companies operating in a less 
				turbulent economic environment – aim for higher growth or focus 
				on stability?</b><br>
				<br>
				I would say first things first: Aim for a totally energised work 
				force. I’m in favour of aggressive competitiveness but not 
				terribly charmed when in the midst of a great recession somebody 
				takes advantage of a failing company. We should not behave like 
				sharks. People remember acts of good behaviour in a downturn 
				much longer than they do in an upturn. I wrote somewhere in my 
				new book: “Look if I’ve got a competitor who is going out of 
				business I’m not going to pay his bills that’s for sure but I’ll 
				not start stealing people from him. Behave decently for God 
				sake!”<br>
				<br>
				To answer your question, I think there has to be an emphasis on 
				growth in some form or another. Aiming to be static is not 
				exciting. If the company is in a good shape financially and 
				there are opportunities and things that can be acquired less 
				expensively and if you happen to be sitting on a pretty good 
				heap of cash in Oman, use it. But remember most big acquisitions 
				don’t work. <br>
				<br>
				The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too 
				high and we may miss it but that it is too low and we will reach 
				it. Excellence can be obtained if you expect more than you think 
				is possible. Dream more than others think is practical. Care 
				more than others think is wise. Risk more than others think is 
				safe.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How has Tom Peters changed from In Search of Excellence to 
				The Little Big Things?</b><br>
				<br>
				One of the things I’m trying to do in my new book compared to 
				the first one I wrote long time back is to go back to human 
				basics. In this age of Internet and social networking, the world 
				has changed. But it is still about people. The fundamentals of 
				relationships with people have not changed probably since we 
				started evolving thousands of years ago.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;We are what we are not due to our analytical abilities but due to our 
				social networking ability. The magic of humans differentiating 
				from the rest was that we could form communities. That was good 
				management. You and I can’t beat a tiger individually but if we 
				form a group of people, we can. That’s what scientists term as 
				social grooming. It’s the social glue and it is important. 
				Despite being primitive they could build communities. It has 
				always been about relationships.<br>
				I’ll quote Donald Trump who said that if the relationship with 
				company A is better than company B I would rather do business 
				with company A. That’s the real world. <br>
				<br>
				I’m a regular user of Twitter. I got a blog site that’s among 
				the top 10 management leadership blogs. It is all about people 
				and people. I may sound Darwanian but we have not changed much 
				from what we were 50,000 years ago.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What made you write The Little Big Things?<br>
				</b><br>
				It just happened by chance. In my blog, I had been giving tips 
				on achieving excellence. It was all about tiny little things 
				that leads to an enormous impact on the business. Over the 
				years, the number of tips touched 176 mark. Then one day a 
				publisher sent an email to me – “You have inadvertently written 
				your new book”. That was the trigger and I started working on 
				the book. <br>

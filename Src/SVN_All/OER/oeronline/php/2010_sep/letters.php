				I read your cover story ‘Leadership in times of turbulence’ of 
				the August edition with great interest. There is something to 
				learn from the thought-provoking and interesting insights shared 
				by leaders of various industries in Oman. It was a good learning 
				opportunity, I must say.<br>
				<br>
				To me, business is basically managing other people’s money. 
				There is a great leadership role to make this happen in a 
				professional way, for which everyone involved in the trade 
				should be brought into confidence – top management, stake 
				holders, employees and customers. <br>
				<br>
				Since recession was quite unforeseen as it was never experienced 
				in the recent past, it was the perfect time for many individuals 
				in the business to showcase their leadership ability at a 
				crucial situation like this. The wisdom and insights are paid 
				off genuinely if the actions are planned and implemented 
				appropriately.<br>
				<br>
				One of the most difficult tasks for any leader is managing its 
				workforce. A full-fledged action plan is required to achieve 
				this task, especially when the world economy became a victim of 
				the downturn. This requires support from all corners. A strong 
				resource management would cater to the requirements of any 
				organisation at any given point of time. Recognising and 
				rewarding employees during crisis would also help retaining the 
				morale within. <br>
				<br>
				Customers should be the next focus, as they greatly depend on 
				organisations to run their business. Some of the experiences 
				shared in the article have clearly endorsed this fact. <br>
				<br>
				Leadership should also have the ability to observe things 
				happening outside the organisation and could learn from 
				examples. Since recession has not seriously affected business in 
				Oman, it clearly proves that good leadership can make difference 
				at critical occasions. <br>
				<br>
				Taking good decision is one of the best qualities of a matured 
				leader. <br>

				<b>Informative reporting</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				The cover story ‘Leadership in times of turbulence’ in the 
				August 2010 issue of Oman Economic Review was timely and 
				informative. It was really interesting to read how captains of 
				different industrial houses in Oman managed to stay on course 
				during turbulent times. While many of the industrial behemoths 
				all over the world laid-off workers following the global 
				economic slowdown, industrial houses in Oman did not sack many 
				employees. It was really inspiring to read that Omani companies 
				like the Al Sulaimi Group actually recruited workers.<br>
				<br>
				This definitely shows the strength of Oman’s economy and 
				professionalism of Omani companies. Some of them like Vision 
				Investment Services took steps to boost the morale of employees 
				by being transparent on the company’s performance, creating a 
				fun environment and helping workers to focus on opportunities. 
				There is no doubt that leaders of industry in Oman showed the 
				vision and ability to assess the crisis with an open mind and 
				find ways to come out of it. Congratulations to OER for 
				publishing such stories which are sure to inspire Omani 
				entrepreneurs to do better in the coming days.<br>

				<b>Misleading<br>
				</b><br>
				I am regular reader of your magazine. But, of late, the quality 
				of the articles is coming down. For instance, the cover story 
				‘Leadership in times of turbulence’ is misleading. In Oman, we 
				are yet to fully tap the potentials of our executives. A 
				leader’s skills depend on a variety of factors such as the 
				ability to work under stress, overcome complex situation, 
				inculcate team spirit etc.<br>
				My suggestion is to give a questionnaire to industry chiefs. It 
				will be better to develop three or four models and ask them 
				which is ideal for them. Besides informal interviews with 
				employees, customers, bankers etc will also add to the quality 
				of the discussion.<br>

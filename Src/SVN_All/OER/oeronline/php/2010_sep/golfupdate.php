					Nelson’s is a remarkable story. He grew up close to Ben 
					Hogan and both men caddied at the same golf club. Where it 
					was said they squared off for the club’s caddie championship 
					in 1927, with Nelson winning.<br>
					<br>
					Although Nelson turned professional in 1932, it would be 
					five years before he won his first Major, the US Masters 
					Championship. To confirm his arrival, he was selected for 
					that year’s Ryder Cup squad.<br>
					While the pre-war period was good to Nelson, his career 
					really took off during the war. While Hogan and many of the 
					other top professionals were sent off to war, Nelson was 
					forced to stay home because it took his blood 13 minutes 
					instead of two to congeal. During the 1940s, he played in 
					133 tournaments and was in the money list in every one of 
					them. At that time that meant the top 10. He had 11 
					consecutive wins in 1945 and won the PGA Championship. He 
					was also that year’s leading money earner.<br>
					<br>
					Starting in 1942 and ending in 1946, Byron Nelson finished 
					in the Top 10 in 65 consecutive tournaments. Over that full 
					time period, Nelson finished out of the Top 10 only once, 
					winning 34 times and finishing second 16 more times. 
					Nelson’s 1945 season is the best ever by a male golfer. He 
					won 18 times, including 11 tournaments in a row. He did it 
					with a 68.33 stroke average that was not bested for another 
					55 years.<br>
					<br>
					Nelson was among the first of a new generation of players 
					who developed a full swing with increased leg drive leading 
					the downswing; this is the forerunner of modern golf 
					technique as practiced by top players, right to the present 
					day. Nelson is sometimes credited as being the father of 
					modern golf swing. He refined the changes for a couple of 
					years, and then took his game to the highest level of 
					competition, the PGA Tour.<br>
					<br>
					The story goes that his wife suggested that he played goal 
					in order to raise the money to buy their own ranch rather 
					than touch their savings. Nelson achieved that goal in 1946. 
					He played his last tournament in 1955 to be a rancher, later 
					becoming a commentator and lending his name to the HP Byron 
					Nelson Championship, the first PGA Tour event to be named 
					for a professional golfer.<br>
					<br>
					In 1974, Byron Nelson received the Bob Jones Award, the 
					highest honour given by the United States Golf Association 
					in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf.</font></p>

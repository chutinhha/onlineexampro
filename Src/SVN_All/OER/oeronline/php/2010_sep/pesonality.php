				<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eric Kerboriou, Marketing 
				Director, Nawras live a diverse and colourful life both 
				personally and professionally, reports Visvas Paul D Karra</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				When acclaimed French make-up artist Fred Farrugia decided to go 
				solo and launch his own makeup line, he was not afraid to break 
				classic makeup fundamentals by designing totally personal and 
				adaptable make-up. The result: The Swiss army knife of make-up, 
				boasting of a very contemporary, practical, pretty and simple 
				packaging all in one. The designs, sold in white plastic 
				containers, include eye shadows, foundations, blush, lipstick 
				and concealer. The year was 2005 and Farrugia’s make-up line 
				went on to become world-renowned.<br>
				<br>
				The notable part of this success story is that Eric Kerboriou, 
				the marketing director of Nawras, had been the business 
				consultant for Farrugia when the latter decided to go solo. 
				Before anyone’s eyes begin to open wide in amazement, let it be 
				also known that the multifarious skills of Kerboriou also led 
				him to work for French automotive giant Renault before he got 
				into the telecom sector.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
				Living the brand</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Having seen and worked in industries as diverse as chalk and 
				cheese, Kerboriou, however, draws a parallel between the telecom 
				sector and the wellness and beauty industry. Both are about 
				brand life and passion. Both need extensive media publicity to 
				hold the brand and both need people who are passionate about 
				their brands. Holding Nawras CEO Ross Cormack in high esteem, 
				Kerboriou opines that Cormack lives and breathes Nawras just 
				like Farrugia who is passionate about his brand.<br>
				<br>
				The key elements to the success of a brand are the right 
				positioning, the harmony of the logo with the visuals along with 
				good financing and marketing. These coupled with good publicity 
				build a brand and ensure that it stays on top for a long time.<br>
				<br>
				Kerboriou, with a Franco-Italian parental lineage, lived his 
				life all over the world. He obtained a masters degree in 
				economics from the University Paris IX Dauphine and worked with 
				Renault in France where he developed a strong financial and 
				commercial background. He did his MBA at the Business School of 
				HEC Paris and finished it at Wharton School, in Philadelphia, 
				US. The 42-year-old Kerboriou says that more than 25 years of 
				his life have been spent outside of France, much of which was in 
				the so-called Black African countries like Nigeria, Senegal etc.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Telecom stint</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Kerboriou worked with American startup FusionOne and French 
				startup Bouygues Telecom in the period between 2003 and 2006. 
				During his time with the latter, his responsibilities included 
				sales, marketing, communication, e-commerce, advertising and 
				business development with the creation of two subsidiaries 
				Mobile Direct and Bouygues Telecom Caraibes. The period in 
				telecom startups and companies took him to the Caribbean as well 
				as the Black African countries.<br>
				Many companies, including telcos, which flourished during the 
				dotcom boom later went bust as they had difficulties in managing 
				cash, due to which overseas operations of many US telcos had to 
				be shut down. When this began to happen, Kerboriou moved away 
				from the telcos and went into the consulting business. It was 
				during this time that he was the consultant for launching the 
				famed Fred Farrugia make-up line.<br>
				<br>
				From 2006 to 2009, Kerboriou worked with Tunisiana 
				telecommunications company, a 50-50 subsidiary of Qatar’s Qtel 
				and Egypt’s Orascom. While there, he participated in the 
				development of the company’s marketshare and profitability also 
				contributing to its market leading position in Tunisia. 
				Kerboriou joined Nawras in 2009 to further strengthen the Nawras 
				brand and lead the team focusing on the company’s pleasingly 
				different marketing objectives.<br>
				<br>
				Talking about his experience in such diverse markets, Kerboriou 
				says that it is a difficult process to build a brand but it is 
				easy to kill it. Moreover, talking about living the customer’s 
				experience is an easy thing to say but difficult to apply. In 
				this regard, he is full of appreciation for all of the Nawras 
				staff who is able to carry the brand so well.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sure-fire projects</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Kerboriou has an enviable educational background in finance and 
				marketing. This heady combination gives him an edge while 
				proposing new projects for his company. With number crunching 
				coming easily to him, whenever he proposes a new marketing 
				strategy for Nawras, there is a higher chance that it will be 
				accepted quickly because the management is aware that Kerboriou 
				would have worked out the financials as well. In this way, he 
				has been able to get approval for more than 100 projects in the 
				last one and a half year he has been with Nawras. Some of these 
				projects are not visible to the public but most of them have 
				been instrumental in increasing the goodwill of the brand.<br>
				<br>
				By the end of 2009, Nawras had achieved 47 per cent market share 
				and received the ‘Brand Leadership’ award at the global awards 
				for brand excellence as well as ‘Customer Service Provider of 
				the Year’ from CommsMEA and Middle East Call Centre of the Year 
				from Insights. Towards the end of 2009 itself, Nawras gained the 
				Superbrand status.<br>
				<br>
				Kerboriou’s mantra of success consists of two elements: Good 
				interpersonal skills and creativity which includes a vision 
				along with analytical and financial skills. These will help you 
				to understand the job better and help you to bridge any gap and 
				enable the company to grow translating into better margins and 
				cash flows.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sportive life</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				If the professional life of Kerboriou is remarkable, then his 
				passions in life are impressive as well. This father of two 
				children, at age 42, has mastered two martial arts – karate and 
				kung fu. Actually, he is learning a third one, Brazilian 
				jujitsu, thanks to sensei Steve Deltoro, former MMA (Mixed 
				Martial Art) competition fighter, whom he met in Muscat. Besides 
				this, he is a great lover of outdoor sports activities like 
				sailing, water skiing, tennis etc. He does not just love these 
				sports, but also teaches some of them.<br>
				<br>
				As a tennis coach, he coached European wheelchair tennis 
				champion Frenchman Laurent Giammartini for three years. 
				Giammartini was the European wheelchair champion for 10 years 
				and won a medal at the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics where 
				wheelchair tennis was introduced for the first time as a full 
				medal sport.<br>
				<br>
				Kerboriou also has great affinity for water sports like sailing 
				and water skiing. He was the Senegalese sailing champion in two 
				categories – the optimist and wind surfing, and was involved in 
				the sport as an instructor. Here in Oman, jet skiing is amongst 
				his favourite activities. He has many friends in Muscat who love 
				the exhilarating rides and he has bought two jet skis for 
				himself – magnificent beasts as he calls them. At other times, 
				he also goes scuba diving to seek underwater thrills.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Set goals in life</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				</font>
				<img border="1" src="images/sep_personality2.jpg" hspace="7" vspace="7" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Psychological books are part of Kerboriou’s reading habits and 
				he has consumed most of Dale Carnegie’s writings. Currently, he 
				is studying Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), which he says is 
				good for human resources development. NLP is considered as a 
				controversial approach to psychotherapy and organisational 
				change. NLP is based on ‘a model of interpersonal communication 
				chiefly concerned with the relationship between successful 
				patterns of behaviour and the subjective experiences (especially 
				patterns of thought) underlying them”. This system of 
				alternative therapy seeks to educate people in self-awareness 
				and effective communication, and to change their patterns of 
				mental and emotional behaviour in order to help them achieve 
				specific goals in life.<br>
				<br>
				Everyone should have some goals in life and a personal drive to 
				achieve them, says Kerboriou when asked what his plans are for 
				the future. If you want to attain your goals, you should 
				announce them to your friends and family as this will make you 
				to remain committed until you reach that goal. There are 
				numerous examples of this, says Kerboriou. He cites the example 
				of Bruce Lee who was noticed as a karate champion at a very 
				young age. When journalists asked what he wanted to become in 
				life, Bruce Lee had said he wanted to be a star and he did 
				become a movie star.<br>
				<br>
				On a philosophical note, Kerboriou believes that every person 
				should programme themselves to live the present moment to the 
				fullest because if you wait to do or achieve something later on 
				in life, the body and mind may not be functioning at the same 
				optimum level as before.<br>
				<br>
				Having worked in diverse professional capacities of marketing, 
				sales and finance, Kerboriou says that one day he would like to 
				start his own company or become the head of a telecom company. 
				For a multi-faceted personality like Kerboriou, we can be sure 
				that opportunities would come knocking at his door because 
				excelling in what he does and living life to the maximum are 
				part of his nature.<br>

            and using a treadmill can be one of the most sensible health 
            decisions you can make. Fitness professionals recommend treadmills 
            more than any other piece of home exercise equipment. They are 
            functional, easy to use, and when used correctly, provide an ideal 
            way to burn calories, manage weight and strengthen, and enhance the 
            cardiovascular system. But buyers beware! Since treadmills are the 
            most extensive category in the fitness industry, there are more 
            choices than any other fitness equipment. OER sifted through a 
            number of treadmills available in the global mart to put together

                    <br>
                    Gaming is big business - recent figures confirm that the 
                    worldwide gaming market is valued at between US$30 and US$35 
                    billion. To put those figures into context, the size of the 
                    gaming industry is now approaching the music industry, which 
                    is worth around US$38 billion and has already surpassed the 
                    motion picture industry in terms of box office revenue. In 
                    brief, gaming has emerged as a critical form of 
                    entertainment and leisure for the majority of 15 - 30 
                    year-olds across the globe. <br>
                    <br>
                    Hundreds of millions of consumer gamers use a variety of 
                    gaming platforms: more than 200 million play PC games, more 
                    than 140 million play console games, another 100 million 
                    play handheld games. Mobile and online gaming is now 
                    emerging, mainly through PCs, console devices and mobile 
                    phones. In addition, more than 60% of gamers are now over 
                    the age of 18. This widening age distribution means that 
                    gaming is not, as some may perceive, for Gen Y’ers only. 
                    Indeed, analysts predict that games will move very much into 
                    the mainstream - something that will see ordinary people 
                    playing games much more, particularly using mobile phones 
                    and TV sets. <br>

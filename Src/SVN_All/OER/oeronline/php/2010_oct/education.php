					<br>
					</b>Muhammed Nafie reports</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>

					Since ELS Language Centres (ELS) has emerged as the industry 
					leader in English language instruction in the Sultanate, 
					offering first class experience in English language 
					proficiency for academic, professional and everyday 
					purposes. One of the world’s most respected English language 
					providers and training institutes, ELS was introduced in 
					Oman under joint-venture control and guidance of the 
					International Training and Educational Services (ITES) 
					company. With five centres situated in main urban areas of 
					the country and equipped with highly qualified on and off 
					centre teachers comprising native English speakers from the 
					US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand, ELS offers a 
					wide range of English as a Second Language (ESL) programmes 
					designed to help students reach their personal, academic and 
					career goals.<br>
					<br>
					“We are purely business-oriented and academic-oriented. ELS 
					specialises in English language, unlike many other 
					institutes and cultural centres that offer such courses,” 
					says Hussein Hassnaoui, corporate managing director, Muscat 
					Branch, ELS. “We are not part of any organisation and ours 
					is not a non-profit organisation or a cultural arm. ELS is 
					an international brand name and we have gained the trust of 
					a large number of people, institutions, organisations, and 
					ministries. We know the requirements and the scope of the 
					industry.”<br>
					<br>
					“We do not belong to any other cultural or non-profit 
					centres in the world. We take our own independent decisions 
					based on our requirements. We specialise only in English. We 
					do not provide English with other things. There are 
					institutes that provide English with IT, accounting etc. But 
					we are not providing any other thing along with English.”<br>
					<br>

					<br>
					Although ELS language centres came into existence as the US 
					State Department-affiliated English Education Institute in 
					the 1950s, it became a private centre in 1961. Nearly three 
					million people from over 140 different countries acquired 
					English language skills suitable for everyday communication 
					and for academic study in foreign colleges and universities.<br>
					<br>
					With more than 600 US universities, colleges and career 
					schools recognising ELS graduation as an enrollment 
					alternative to the TOEFL test, ELS helps a large number of 
					foreign students every year to embark on academic studies 
					around the world. “Currently, we have roughly 100 centres 
					all over the world – including 50 in the US and 18 in the 
					Middle East,” says Hassnaoui.<br>
					<br>
					ELS became a part of the Berlitz International group of 
					companies in 1997. ELS recognition was acknowledged by 
					numerous national governments and multinational companies. 
					US educational institutions enrol ELS graduates with ToEFL 
					requirement and leading companies such as American Express, 
					Bank of America, Citibank, Coca-Cola, DuPont SA, General 
					Electric, IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mobil Oil, Nestle, Price 
					Waterhouse, UNICEF and Xerox have employed ELS programmes.<br>
					<br>
					ELS Language Centres is fully accredited by the government-recognised 
					body responsible for oversight of ESL schools (ACCET) and is 
					affiliated with a number of US organisations such as 
					Accrediting Council for Continuing Education &amp; Training (ACCET), 
					American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions 
					Officers (AACRAO), Teachers of English to Speakers of Other 
					Languages (TESOL) American Association of Intensive English 
					Language Programs (AAIEP) and Association of International 
					Educators.<br>

					<br>
					ELS Oman has carefully designed curricula and courses of 
					study to help students develop the language skills and 
					test-taking techniques needed to succeed in TOEFL iBT, the 
					GMAT, SAT, GRE, TOEIC, IELTS or any other English language 
					proficiency exam.<br>
					<br>
					Intensive English Programme (IEP), ELS’ most popular 
					programme of study, prepares the students for university 
					study in America and other English speaking countries. A 
					popular course among young Omanis aspiring to improve the 
					chances of a better career and education in Oman, IEP 
					focuses on the communicative approach to teach all key 
					language skills- speaking, listening, pronunciation, 
					vocabulary, reading and writing.<br>
					<br>
					ELS has also designed various business and legal English 
					courses catering to the new professional and industrial 
					requirements. English for Special Purposes (ESP) is a 
					special programme for industry professionals. It offers the 
					employers an opportunity to provide their staff with a 
					customised English programme that focuses on the vocabulary 
					and real-life experiences specific to their industry and 
					specialisation.<br>
					<br>
					A multi-level conversation programme and conversation club 
					of ELS gives an opportunity for the students to participate 
					in informal discussions on current events and interesting 
					topics designed to develop spoken English strengths and 
					combat fluency and pronunciation weaknesses. Beside, ELS 
					offers a fun and exciting Children’s and Young Adult English 
					Language programme during the winter and summer months. <br>
					<br>

					Strategic programmes</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Oman ELS has a tie-up with many universities and government 
					and private companies. “We have prepared foundation courses 
					for many universities. We have a tie-up with Buraimi 
					University and Al Sharqiyah University,” says Hassnaoui.<br>
					“Apart from General English programmes, ELS has prepared 
					university foundation year programmes for the Tourism 
					College and Nizwa University. Besides, we have implemented a 
					joint project with the Arab Open University (AOU) in Muscat 
					which has given us the opportunity to run the AOU foundation 
					English classes in remote areas such as Nizwa, Sohar, and 
					Salalah.”<br>
					<br>
					Moreover, ELS programmes have been employed by Nawras, Oman 
					Mobile, Bank Dhofar, Oman Development Bank, Royal Oman 
					Police and several ministries in the Sultanate.<br>
					<br>
					In another major development, ELS Oman became a testing 
					partner with the world’s largest language assessment 
					company, ETS, to deliver the new TOEFL iBT exam. ELS has 
					expanded its portfolio to include a stream of academic 
					programmes to guide students through a multi-level course in 
					order to achieve successful results on this difficult and 
					important exam.<br>

					<br>
					Elaborating on the interest of Omani students in and their 
					enrollment to various proficiency courses in ELS centres, 
					Hassnoui says, “Almost 90 per cent of our students are 
					Omanis, though we have students of other nationalities. They 
					are very eager to learn. We are getting a lot of new 
					requests. They believe in the importance of continuous 
					training updating skills and give a lot of priority to 
					improving themselves.<br>
					<br>
					“We inculcate in the students the values of open-mindedness 
					and encourage them to adopt and adapt which is very 
					essential in the communication. We also encourage them to 
					learn by themselves,” he adds.<br>
					<br>
					Headquartered in Azaiba, Muscat, ELS Oman has an annex in 
					Al-Hail and branches in Salalah, Sohar and Sur.<br>

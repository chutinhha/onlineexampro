gets better</b><br>
The Playstation has just got better and handier. Sony’s PSP, which was launched 
last month, takes gaming notches higher. This portable and sleek new gaming 
device comes with extra features compared to its older siblings. <br>
<br>
The PSP Value Pack comprises an added-value package of accessories and 
entertainment content that includes the PSP system with a pouch, 32MB Memory 
Stick Duo, Battery Pack, Headphones with Remote Control, AC Adaptor, Wrist 
Strap, cloth and a video/music/game sampler Universal Media Disc (UMD™) 
including several game demos.<br>
<br>
PSP features a 4.3-inch, 16:9 widescreen TFT LCD that displays full colour 
(16.77 million colours) on a 480 x 272 pixel high-resolution screen. PSP also 
boasts of built-in stereo speakers, exterior headphone connector and a range of 
input/output connectors such as USB 2.0 and 802.11b Wireless LAN, enabling users 
to connect to the Internet and play online via a Wireless Network. <br>
<br>
That’s not all. Up to 16 PSP systems in the vicinity can be connected to each 
other directly in Ad Hoc Mode, allowing for Wireless head-to-head competition. 
In addition, Wireless capabilities will allow software and data to be downloaded 
to PSP and saved onto a Memory Stick Duo.<br>
<br>
PSP uses a newly-developed proprietary storage medium named Universal Media 
Disc™ (UMD‘). This high-capacity optical disc is the next-generation compact 
storage media, and although only 60mm in diameter, a UMD can store up to 1.8GB 
of digital data – more than three times the data held on a CD-ROM. <br>
<br>
A broad range of digital entertainment content such as high quality 3D games, 
music, movies, video clips and other media can be distributed on UMD. PSP will 
support around 20 game titles and in addition there will also be over 30 movie 
titles available at launch on UMD Video (Region Code 2) including such 
blockbusters as: Spider-Man 2, Hitch, Charlie’s Angels and xXx.</font></p>

            It's a wee bit larger than an iPod mini and also lighter than a 
            Motorola Razr phone. Nintendo means serious business when they say 
            micro. It’s the Game Boy Micro in discussion here, Nintendo’s 
            smallest gaming console and one of the hottest gizmos around. <br>
            <br>
            The Game Boy Micro comes in both silver and black versions, each 
            with three removable, fun faceplates that enable users to 
            personalise their Micro depending on their mood. <br>
            <br>
            Game Boy Micro measures just 4 inches wide, 2 inches long and 0.7 
            inches thin. As far as the weight is weighs only 2.8 ounces. Size 
            has in no way deterred the power of the concole. It’s as powerful as 
            the previous Game Boy Advance models, with the ability to play all 
            Game Boy Advance games, which includes a library of more than 700 
            titles. Game Boy Micro features a 2-inch, crystal-clear screen, and 
            Start/Select buttons that glow with the cool, neon-like blue found 
            on many cell phones. The Game Boy Micro's 2-inch screen sports a 
            backlight with five levels of brightness, which is the first such<img border="0" src="giz3.jpg" width="180" height="109" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="1"> 
            display on a Game Boy.<br>
            <br>
            The black Game Boy Micro includes one faceplate with a ‘Flame’ 
            design of fiery yellow double helixes on an orange background. It 
            also comes with a green ‘Camouflage’ faceplate and a chic silver 
            faceplate. The silver Game Boy Micro includes an ‘Ammonite’ 
            faceplate with a dark blue swirling pattern, a ‘Ladybug’ faceplate 
            and a slick black faceplate. The Micro also has a standard headphone 
            jack.<br>
            <br>
            And in case we forget to mention, the Game Boy Micro coolly fits in 
            your jeans pocket!</font></p>

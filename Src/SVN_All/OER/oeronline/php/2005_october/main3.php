the wake of Free Trade Agreement talks between Western US and Australia and 
Middle Eastern UAE and Oman, local and regional companies are in a race to build 
and strengthen their brands before the onslaught of cheaper, better known global 
brands. <br>
<br>
When the trade barriers that have protected local and regional organisations for 
so long begin to crumble, the renowned global brands will have free access to 
Middle Eastern markets, competing head on with regional brands. Even regional 
distributors and agents will not be immune, they too will have to protect and 
enhance the value of the brands they promote.<br>
<br>
Organisations will no longer be able to compete on price alone. They will need 
to build their brands and develop corporate identities – vital for reinforcing 
awareness and preference among stakeholders and customers alike. In this fast 
developing market the success of the brand will directly pave the way for 
marketing and sales growth.<br>
Names, logos, tag lines and competitive pricing are no longer enough to protect 
brand value. It is increasingly company reputation, image and policies regarding 
corporate social responsibility that will drive brand value in the future.<br>
<br>
In September the marketing who’s who of the Middle East will come together in a 
veritable think-tank to address this issue. They will celebrate and examine 
brands that have excelled in the market and plot the way for the success of 
emerging Multi-National and Regional organisations. The focus will be on 
managing brand excellence through strategy and performance.<br>
<br>
The 2nd Middle East Brand Manager Forum will see a meeting of some of the 
leading regional and international brands – with cutting-edge presentations by 
experts in the field from leading organisations including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, 
Procter &amp; Gamble, Aston Martin, LG Electronics, HSBC bank, Standard Chartered 
Bank and many more.<br>
<br>
Superbrands Director, Mike English, will be addressing the issue at hand in a 
session entitled “The Importance Of Brand Excellence In The Middle East”. The 
Superbrands organisation is acclaimed worldwide as being an independent 
authority and arbiter of branding excellence and is committed to paying tribute 
to exceptional brands and promoting the discipline of branding. They are a 
fighting force for local and regional brands in the Middle East and are working 
to promote brand building and brand excellence within local and regional 
organisations. <br>
<br>
It’s time for Middle Eastern organisations to take the next step to growing 
truly global-worthy brands. With great companies and great local and regional 
brands the potential is vast! <br>

                    <b>Oman to develop The Blue City</b><br>
                    The Al Sawadi Development project—The Blue City—is poised to 
                    take off with a new group of investors and developers. 
                    Formed eight months ago, the company that will be in charge 
                    of this massive tourism development opportunity is called Al 
                    Sawadi Investment &amp; Tourism Company (ASIT). Besides the 
                    Omani company Cyclone LLC, the consortium now includes Ahmed 
                    Abubaker Janahi Holdings (AAJ Holdings), an 
                    Investor/Developer from Bahrain, and OASIS Middle East 
                    Holding, an investment company. <br>
                    <br>
                    ASIT and its development consultants have worked intensively 
                    over the last eight months to prepare a whole new concept 
                    for the development. The consultants of previous schemes are 
                    no longer involved. To be developed over several phases in 
                    the next 10–15 years, the Blue City will include many 
                    tourism components – eventually, several hotels and tourism 
                    attractions, as well as strategic economic development 
                    clusters that are aligned with the national interests of 
                    Oman and more particular in the education, healthcare, 
                    sports and marine sectors. One of the largest urban economic 
                    development projects of the Gulf region, The Blue City is 
                    anticipated to become home for more than 200,000 people. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Government of the Sultanate is backing the development 
                    and giving it substantial support on many levels. 
                    Specifically, it will encourage foreign investment in the 
                    country and boost the nation’s tourism potential. As such, 
                    the development is expected to help the economic growth of 
                    the country significantly. It will also create education, 
                    professional training and employment opportunities for many 
                    thousands of Omanis, right from the initial phases, through 
                    to its completion as a viable, working city.</font></span></p>

                    in the future</b><br>
                    Rational AG recently commissioned its new research 
                    laboratory at its Landsberg am Lech head office in Germany. 
                    The new laboratory provides over 30 per cent more space for 
                    the development of innovative new products in the thermal 
                    preparation of food for professional catering. Work on 
                    product optimisation and new development is carried out 
                    continuously at a total 25 testing positions. Over 50 
                    development engineers, including home economists, chemists, 
                    physicists, engineers and chefs, collaborate on developing 
                    ever better solutions for the professional kitchen. This 
                    uses up around 18 tonnes of food a year. <br>
                    <br>
                    The only way of adequately checking the functionality of new 
                    developments is to test them on the latest international 
                    dishes in a real kitchen environment. So Rational continues 
                    to put its money on the concentration of know-how. Core 
                    competence is subordinated exclusively to the corporate 
                    objective of providing the maximum possible benefit to 
                    people engaged in the thermal preparation of food in 
                    commercial and catering establishments. Rational therefore 
                    sees its investment in the new laboratory as an investment 
                    in the future. <br>
                    <br>
                    Barely seven years have passed between the market launch of 
                    the Rational CPC in 1997 and the introduction of the world’s 
                    first SelfCooking Center this year. But even during this 
                    period, there have been numerous new developments 
                    demonstrating Rational’s claim to innovation. Starting with 
                    the CleanJet self-cleaning function through CombiCheck to 
                    CombiFry, CombiGrill and CombiLink. To enable Rational to

                    <b>SOMC AGM approves further dividend</b><br>
                    Shell Oman Marketing Company (SOMC) held its eighth Annual 
                    General Meeting last month, where the company’s shareholders 
                    approved the recommended dividend of 530 baisa per share for 
                    the financial year ended December 31, 2004. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‘‘The company has recorded a notable achievement in terms of 
                    working capital efficiency. For the first time ever, an 
                    interim dividend was paid to shareholders in 2004. The 
                    company recorded a dividend yield of 18.2 per cent on the 
                    share prices as at 30 December, 2004, making it 111 per cent 
                    higher than the dividend yield for 2003’’, announced Dr 
                    Andrew Wood, Chairman, SOMC. The company has delivered RO5.3 
                    million net income after tax for the year. <br>
                    <br>
                    Efficiency has been the point of focus for the retail 
                    business, with rigorous marketing activities to improve the 
                    customer value proposition, targeting full customer 
                    satisfaction. As far as the commercial business is 
                    concerned, a combination of proper portfolio management and 
                    profitable growth has been the major criteria. Effective 
                    market coverage and timely responsiveness to developments in 
                    the market has enabled conversion of prevailing 
                    opportunities into cash. Outstanding performance has been 
                    achieved, despite tough competitive hurdles on price 
                    discounts and trade terms. <br>
                    <br>
                    The aviation business has had a relatively good performance 
                    despite being affected by competition at the beginning of 
                    the year. Overall, aviation volumes have been healthier, for 
                    the full year, than originally expected. ‘‘Today, with an 
                    Omani firmly at helm of management, the company has recorded 
                    a new achievement, consistent with its progressive 
                    Omanisation of the senior management over the past few 
                    years’’, Dr Wood added.</span></font></p>

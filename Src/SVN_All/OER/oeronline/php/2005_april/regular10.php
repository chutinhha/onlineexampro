            East leads Infiniti’s drive into global luxury markets</b><br>
            The Infiniti chose the Middle East as the first market outside North 
            America to launch its latest luxury vehicle line-up. Since early 
            2005, a new range of Infiniti cars and luxury sport utility vehicles 
            has been available to customers in the Middle East. This includes 
            the FX crossover and G35 sports sedan and coupe. The Infiniti brand 
            has been represented in the Middle East since 2002 through the 
            limited import of the Q45 luxury sedan. The new range of Infiniti 
            vehicles will make the Middle East the second region outside of 
            North America to sell a complete range of Infiniti vehicles, 
            supported by eight dealers across the region.<br>
            <br>
            “We are convinced that Infiniti, following its success in the 
            fiercely competitive US market, will strongly appeal to Middle East 
            luxury vehicle customers,” said Carlos Ghosn, president and CEO of 
            Nissan Motor Co. “A $2 billion automotive luxury market, the Middle 
            East is one of the world’s most important markets for luxury 
            vehicles. We are confident that Infiniti will make an immediate 
            impact and quickly establish a significant presence in the Middle 
            East luxury market.” <br>
            <br>
            Since its initial North American launch in November 1989, Infiniti 
            has been an award-winning leader in customer satisfaction, 
            cutting-edge design and high performance. Following the introduction 
            of the G35 sports sedan and coupe in 2001, Infiniti has expanded its 
            vehicle line-up constantly and become the fastest-growing luxury 
            brand in the US for the past two years. Launching Infiniti in the 
            Middle East is part of a long-term global growth strategy for 
            Infiniti. In 2005, Infiniti will launch in Korea followed by planned 
            introductions in other major global luxury markets over the course 
            of the next three-to-five years.<br>
            <br>
            Five new Infiniti models will be sold in the Middle East starting in 
            the first half of 2005. These include the 2005 Q45 luxury sedan, 
            QX56 full-size SUV, G35 sports sedan, G35 sports coupe and the FX35 
            premium crossover SUV. ‘‘We expect the five vehicles being launched 
            to mark an exciting chapter in the history of Infiniti brand, both 
            here and across the globe. We are committed to keeping our product 
            line fresh and invigorating… our sales growth strong… and our future 
            wide open to new opportunities and new, higher levels of dynamic 
            luxury performance,’’ said Ghosn at a ceremony held in Dubai to mark 
            the launch of the five vehicles late last year.</font></p>

            <br>
            “The new BMW 3 Series is more dynamic and more spacious than ever – 
            the car is both a mid-range saloon and a sports driving machine. 
            Coming with a host of new first-time features in the mid-range 
            segment such as iDrive, active steering and the engine start button,

            Engineered to deliver exhilarating performance, the top-of-the-range 
            BMW 330i boasts a six-cylinder, 258 brake horsepower (bhp) engine 
            and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.3 seconds. This makes this 
            new three-litre, the most powerful and lightest six-cylinder in its 
            segment. The new BMW 325i has a maximum engine output of 218bhp at 
            6500rpm and acceleration to 100km/h in 7.1 seconds. Rounding off the 
            line-up, the BMW 320i is the most powerful four-cylinder in the 
            range. All models come with a six-speed manual or automatic 
            transmission gearbox making the new 3 Series even more dynamic on 
            the road; accelerating even faster than before and achieving a 
            higher top speed. <br>
            <br>
            All this comes on even less fuel and a higher standard of all-round 
            economy. Reflecting BMW’s great heritage, the new BMW 3 Series comes 
            with all the characteristic features of the brand, that is, with the 
            engine fitted longitudinally, drive power going to the rear wheels, 
            and perfect axle distribution of 50:50. Clearly, such features are

                    The boards of directors of Renaissance Services and Topaz 
                    Energy &amp; Marine (TEAM) have proposed to merge the operations 
                    of the two companies. If talks fructify, the merged entity 
                    will have a net worth of approximately RO50 million ($130 
                    million). As per the tentative deal, the swap ratio will 
                    range between 3.6 to 4.1 shares of TEAM for every one share 
                    of Renaissance Services. The final exchange ratio will 
                    depend on the report of an independent audit. <br>
                    <br>
                    The proposal will be subject to the final approval of the 
                    boards and shareholders of the two companies and the 
                    regulatory bodies. The merged entity will have net fixed 
                    assets of RO40 million and net estimated earnings of between 
                    RO9 million and RO11 million in 2005. If the merger does go 
                    through, Renaissance plans to issue additional shares by way 
                    of a stock dividend to all shareholders. TEAM has proposed a 
                    cash dividend of 10 per cent.<br>
                    <br>
                    ‘‘The consolidation will allow both companies to explore 
                    fresh growth opportunities of greater magnitude than the 
                    standalone resources,’’ said the two companies. The combined 
                    net profit of two companies for the year 2004 stood at RO16 
                    million. TEAM is into ship-owning and repair business, oil 
                    and gas sector fabrication and stainless steel products 
                    whereas Renaissance Services is in contract services, 
                    technology and healthcare, education and training and media 
                    communications (including United Press &amp; Publishing, the 
                    publishers of Oman Economic Review). <br>
                    <br>
                    Renaissance Services announced a 176 per cent growth in net 
                    profit at RO13.46 million for 2004 as compared to RO4.87 
                    million posted in the previous year. The company’s revenues 
                    jumped to RO62.58 million from RO45.97 million during the 
                    period. It has proposed a total 45 per cent dividend (35 per 
                    cent cash and 10 per cent stock) for the year 2004. The 
                    company successfully brought down borrowings by RO 11.7 
                    million last year, which was more than expected.</font></p>

                    The plant, which took just four years from the concept 
                    definition to commissioning, will be needed to feed gas to 
                    the nation's third LNG train, which is currently under 
                    construction at Qalhat. Until the third liquefaction train 
                    is commissioned later this year, the Saih Nihayda plant will 
                    be supplying gas to the two existing liquefaction trains of 
                    the Oman Liquefied Natural Gas plant, also at Qalhat, and to 
                    other costumers via the existing 48-inch pipeline. To ensure 
                    an adequate future supply for all costumers, the capacity of 
                    the 48-inch pipeline is also being expanded by PDO in 
                    another major project that is currently underway.</font></p>

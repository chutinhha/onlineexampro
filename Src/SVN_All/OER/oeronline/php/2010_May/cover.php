					<b><br>
                    The year 2009 will be remembered as a challenging year for 
					the world economies due to the recession caused by the 
					global financial crisis which started half way through 2008. 
					During 2009, an increasing number of countries registered 
					positive quarterly growth of gross domestic product (GDP), 
					along with a notable recovery in international trade and 
					global industrial production. World equity markets have also 
					rebounded and risk premiums on borrowing have fallen. Oman’s 
					consistent policy of economic diversification, with a 
					developing economy together with continued government 
					spending for major projects, assisted Oman in riding through 
					this storm quite successfully. <br>
					<br>
                    </b>The price of oil declined substantially during the year 
					2009. Oman crude realised an average price of $56.7 per 
					barrel in 2009 compared with an average price of $101 for 
					2008 and the budgeted price of $45 per barrel for 2009. Due 
					to higher oil prices than what was budgeted it is expected 
					that most of the estimated fiscal deficit of RO810mn would 
					be covered.<b><br>
                    </b><br>
					<b>Market performance</b><br>
					For the year 2009, the MSM index has advanced by 17.05 per 
					cent. This is compared to a negative performance of (39.12 
					per cent) in the previous fiscal year. The industry sector 
					was the outperformer of the year as the sector advanced by 
					72.31 per cent for the year 2009. Next was the banking and 
					investment index which appreciated by 41.59 per cent for the 
					year. The service and insurance index closed the year with a 
					total gain of 6.89 per cent. A total of 6.09 bn shares got 
					traded during the year amounting to an aggregate turnover of 
					RO2.28bn. The MSM30 index hit a low of 4,187.81 points 
					during the year while the high of the year was 6,785.92 
					points. With a return of 17.05 per cent for the year, the 
					MSM has been the second best performing market in the GCC 
					region after Saudi Arabia which advanced by 27.46 per cent 
					for the year. UAE (DFM) ended the year up by 10.22 per cent 
					and Qatar ended up by 1.06 per cent. Kuwait and Bahrain 
					ended the year down by 9.99 per cent and 19.17 per cent 
					respectively.<br>
					<br>
					The substantial decline in oil prices during the year was 
					overcome partly by increased oil production and increased 
					non-oil exports which resulted in a GDP growth rate of 3.7 
					per cent in 2009. Oil production increased during the year 
					by about of 7.7 per cent to 810,000 barrels per day. The 
					government’s continued emphasis on diversifying the economy 
					away from dependence on oil gained further momentum during 
					2009. Non oil exports grew by 2.9 per cent. The government 
					launched several major projects including extension of the 
					Seeb and Salalah airports, roads and highways.<br>
					<br>
					Performance of world financial markets after a scary 2008 
					revived thanks in part to aggressive central bank policies. 
					Emerging market equities, which led 2008 equity markets down 
					(-45.7 per cent), also led global equities back up in 2009 
					(62.8 per cent) as risk came back into vogue and US 
					investors deployed funds abroad. The MSCI AC World index was 
					up 58.7 per cent in 2009. Global equity markets finished 
					2009 up 62.8 per cent. Emerging Markets were the best 
					performing region (index) followed by Asia Pacific at 58.7 
					per cent, US 26.5 per cent, Europe 25.6 per cent and Japan 
					17.3 per cent.<br>
					<br>
					During the year 2009, the revenues of Oman’s 20 largest 
					companies showed a modest decline. Total revenues of the OER 
					Top 20 went down by two per cent to RO3,126mn. Corporate 
					performance of the year 2009, overall, was also down 
					primarily due to the global recession. The profits for the 
					year 2009 decreased by 12 per cent to RO425mn from the 
					RO480mn last year. The total market cap of the OER Top 20 on 
					December 31, 2009 was RO4,514mn, which was up by 11 per cent 
					compared to 2008. On March 31, 2010, the market cap of the 
					top twenty has once again gone up to RO4,684mn. The OER Top 
					20 companies represent 72 per cent of the total market cap 
					of the MSM of RO6,303mn at the end of 2009. The average P/E 
					ratio of the OER Top 20 based on the profits of the year 
					2009 and the share price on March 31, 2010 is 11.03 times 
					earnings.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 5"> <font face="Verdana" size="1">

					have two newcomers on the list this year. Sohar Ports 
					Services Company comes at the number 19 spot and Sohar Power 
					Company is in the number 20 slot. These companies have made 
					it to the OER Top 20 this year at the expense of Al Jazeera 
					Steel Mills and Al Anwar Holdings.<br>
					<br>
					The ranking of Oman’s twenty largest companies in order of 
					revenue produces a list, which includes the six companies 
					from the banking and investment sector, eight from the 
					services sector and six from the industrial sector.<br>
					<br>
					There has been one change in the top five companies in Oman. 
					Renaissance Services has climbed from number six to five 
					this year, replacing Oman Cables which was at number five 
					last year. Omantel continues to be the largest public 
					company in Oman with a growth in revenue of 0.19 per cent 
					compared to last year.<br>
					<br>
					The chairman of Omantel Eng. Sultan Bin Hamdoon al Harthi in 
					his report to the shareholders explains that the main reason 
					for growth in turnover is because of the consolidation of 
					its subsidiary Worldcall Telecommunications (WTL) revenues. 
					The revenue from the domestic market was lower by four per 
					cent. One of the main reasons for the decline was lower 
					consumer spending resulting from the economic downturn. Al 
					Harthi states that the total group net profit after tax rose 
					by 5.5 per cent to RO125.2mn, the highest net profit ever 
					recorded by Omantel. Al Harthi adds that the total 
					subscriber base has recorded a growth of 46 per cent. The 
					total number of subscribers has increased to 3.03mn compared 
					to 2.08mn last year. He goes on to state that to enhance the 
					internal efficiency and achieve right sizing of the group, 
					Omantel has implemented a Voluntary End of Service programme 
					covering 134 employees amounting to RO9.5mn.<br>

					Harthi states that the sign of gradual economic recovery has 
					started reflecting in the Omani economy. With Oman set to 
					grow at 6.1 per cent in 2010 and government commitment on 
					increased spending on infrastructure projects, it is 
					expected to stimulate the telecom sector well. He however 
					cautions that commencement of operations by the second fixed 
					line operator, five mobile resellers and other new service 
					providers for internet services will increase the 
					competitive landscape in the telecom sector. Al Harthi is 
					confident that with the integration of Omantel and Oman 
					Mobile as a single operating entity and the enhancement of 
					operational synergy, branding and other programmes, Omantel 
					would continue to retain its leading position among the 
					telecom service providers in the Sultanate.<br>
					<br>
					</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Unlike last year, only 
					two of the top five most profitable companies in Oman are 
					banks. As expected in the current economic climate four of 
					the five companies are showing single digit growth in 
					profits for the year whereas one is showing a decline. There 
					are three changes in the top five companies by profit. 
					Raysut Cement, which was in fifth place last year, has moved 
					up to the number three position, Renaissance comes into the 
					number four position from six last year and BankDhofar comes 
					in at number five from number eight last year. NBO and OIB 
					are out of the list of the top five. Omantel continues to 
					remain at the number one spot, Bank Muscat at the number two 
					spot. <br>
					<br>
					Bank Muscat is the second most profitable company in Oman as 
					well as the third largest company in Oman based on turnover 
					for the year 2009. Although Bank Muscat has retained this 
					position from last year, it has recorded a decline in profit 
					for the year of about 21.35 per cent. <br>
					<br>
					</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">The chairman Abdul 
					Malik bin Abdullah al Khalili states in his yearend report 
					to the shareholders that despite the global financial crisis 
					the bank’s core business income during the year 2009 was 
					strong and stable. He explains that the bank achieved a net 
					profit of RO73.7mn as against a net profit of RO93.7mn in 
					2008. The impairment charge of RO98.2 mn was substantially 
					higher than last year as the bank decided to consider full 
					provision for certain large exposures in its overseas 
					branch. <br>

					adds that during 2009, the return on average assets was at 
					1.2 per cent compared to 1.8 per cent in 2008. </font>
					<font face="Verdana" size="1">The return on average equity 
					was 10.8 per cent in 2009 compared to 14.8 per cent in 2008 
					and the basic earnings per share was RO0.068 as against 
					RO0.087 in 2008. <br>
					<br>
					Khalili explains that since the bank is not participating in 
					the rights issue of Silkbank and thereby substantially 
					diluting its stake from an associate status to non-strategic 
					available for sale investment, the Silkbank investment was 
					marked to market in the bank’s books as on December 31, 
					2009. This resulted in impairment losses of RO20.3mn 
					including the loss on depreciation of the Pakistan rupee 
					amounting to RO9.6mn which was earlier adjusted in equity.
					<br>
					<br>
					Khalili goes on to say that the Board has proposed a 
					dividend of 45 per cent, 20 per cent in the form of cash and 
					25 per cent in the form of stock. Khalili advises that the 
					year 2010 with the Sultanate’s strategic economic policies, 
					anticipated increase of oil prices and favourable financial, 
					economic and monetary policies augur well for the national 
					economy which is expected to record a growth rate of 6.1 per 
					cent at constant prices and 18.4 per cent at current prices.
					<br>
					<br>
					Oman Cement has shown the highest growth in profits by an 
					enormous 93.22 per cent and comes into the number one spot 
					from number six last year. Four of the top five companies 
					showing highest growth of profit from last year being Oman 
					Cement, Sohar Power, Al Hassan and Ominvest are new on the 
					list. Al Anwar, Oman Flour, OHI and Renaissance have all 
					dropped off this list. <br>
					<br>
					The chairman of Oman Cement, Qahtan bin Yarub Al Busaidi in 
					his report to the shareholders for the year ended December 
					31, 2009 has stated that the increase in profit of 93.2 per 
					cent is mainly due to improvement in the average selling 
					price, lower procurement cost of imported clinker, 
					discontinuation of import of cement and increased investment 
					income. He points out that the company continues to be a ISO 
					9001-2000 and ISO 14001-2004 certified company. It has also 
					API-SPEC 10A quality monogram certification for 
					manufacturing and sale of oil well cement. The Board has 
					recommended a cash dividend of 37 per cent. <br>

					Busaidi cautions that major increase in supply of cement at 
					low prices from neighboring countries is likely to put the 
					prices under strain in the coming year. He adds that the 
					demand for cement in Oman for the year 2010 as per report of 
					a study done for the company indicates a marginal decline 
					over the 2009 level. Al Busaidi also states that the new 
					production line which is expected to be in operation in the 
					second quarter of 2010 will help the company to reduce the 
					procurement level of imported clinker thereby resulting in a 
					major cost reduction. <br>
					<br>
					Four of the top five companies that have the highest amount 
					of equity employed are banks. All five of the companies in 
					this category remain the same as last year in exactly the 
					same positions. <br>
					<br>
					The chairman of NBO, Omar Al Fardan in his report to the 
					shareholders states that the bank achieved a net profit of 
					RO21.1mn for the year compared to RO45.4mn for 2008 however, 
					on a like-to-like basis the operating income was broadly 
					flat. Al Fardan states that the results have been negatively 
					impacted by factors relating to the global economic crisis. 
					The bank has taken impairment provisions against the 
					investment portfolio of RO4.1mn and provisions of eight 
					million rials against three specific bank exposures. He adds 
					that since the publication on the draft audited financials 
					on January 26, an additional provision of five million rials 
					has been made against two specific distressed real estate 
					exposures. <br>
					<br>
					Al Fardan goes on to say that 2010 will continue to pose 
					challenges in global, regional and local markets. It is 
					possible that the global economy has avoided a prolonged 
					recession but recovery is likely to remain weak and prone to 
					further sharp corrections. However, given the significant 
					progress that has been made globally to avoid a prolonged 
					recession, Al Fardan remains cautiously optimistic about 
					prospects for 2010.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Market performance<br>
					</b>This year, two of the top five companies that have the 
					highest market capitalisation on the MSM are not banks. 
					Omantel remains as the number one this year; BankMuscat 
					remains in the number two spot in this category. BankDhofar 
					has moved up one place to the number three spot. Raysut 
					Cement is back in the number four slot and OIB continues to

					chairman of BankDhofar, Eng. Abdul Hafidh Salim Rajab Al 
					Aujaili in his annual report to the shareholders states that 
					the bank has been prudent with a clear and focused strategy 
					to develop core activities coupled with cautious 
					diversification and striking a healthy balance between risk 
					and return. This simple approach has enabled the bank to 
					achieve better results in 2009 than the previous year in 
					spite of regional and global economic and financial turmoil.
					<br>
					<br>
					Al Aujaili explains that the bank achieved a net profit of 
					RO25.39mn for the year 2009 compared to RO23.69mn for 2008, 
					an increase of 7.18 per cent. In the light of these results 
					the board of directors has proposed a cash dividend of 15 
					per cent and a bonus share issue of 10 per cent. Al Aujaili 
					states that in line with the strategic plan, the bank has 
					made significant investment on a new core banking solution, 
					ATM and internet banking systems to further enrich the 
					services provided to the customers. The implementation of 
					the new core banking solution by the third quarter of 2010 
					with advanced banking features would elevate customer 
					services to a new level and further enhance the bank to be 
					more competitive in the local market. <br>
					<br>
					Interestingly, only one of the top five companies showing 
					the best return on equity employed come from the banking 
					sector. Two of the companies in the top five are newcomers 
					to the list. Shell remains at the number one spot and 
					Omantel continues to remain in the number two slot. Ominvest 
					jumps to the number three slot from being five last year. 
					Raysut Cement at the number four position and Areej 
					Vegetable at the number five position are the two new comers 
					on the list knocking out Oman Oil from the number three slot 
					and Al Anwar Holdings from the number four slot last year.<br>
					<br>
					John Blascos, chairman of Shell Oman Marketing, in his 
					report to the shareholders states that amidst a still 
					unsettled global economic environment the company continued 
					to deliver outstanding results in 2009. During the year the 
					company focused on cost cutting initiatives that included 
					areas such as distribution, lubricants blending as well as 
					administrative and other operating expenses. Blascos adds 
					that the company achieved unprecedented financial results 
					recording a historically highest ever net profit of 
					RO13.02mn compared to previous year’s net profit of 
					RO12.5mn. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the major 
					economies, proactive management as well as sound operational 
					performance were the principal drivers of the commendable 
					financial performance in 2009. Blascos explains that the 
					retail business remains the most important segment for the 
					company. Total retail volumes sold was in line with 2008. 
					The aviation business continues to be highly competitive and 
					the company continued its presence at both the major 
					airports in the country in addition to customers’ owned 
					fields. The market in lubricants also achieved higher 
					penetration. The board has recommended a final dividend of 
					120 per cent for the year continuing the recent trend of 
					year on year dividend growth. <br>
					<br>
					Blascos adds that the fuels market normally follows the 
					economic trend of the country and is thus expected to be 
					stable, growing in tandem with the economic activities. New 
					development in road network and residential area will open 
					up opportunities for addition of new retail sites. Major 
					infrastructure projects announced by the government will see 
					some activities in 2010, and the company will ensure that it 
					is ready to handle stiff competition to get its share of the 
					new business by investing in new systems and business 
					redesign.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Focus is the key<br>
					</b>All of the top five earnings per share growth companies 
					are newcomers on this list. Oman Cement jumps straight into 
					the number one spot. Ominvest comes in at the number two 
					position, Al Hassan at number three, Areej Vegetable at 
					number four and Oman Cable at number five. Oman Flour Mills, 
					Al Anwar, Renaissance, OHI and Shell who were on this list 
					last year have all disappeared from this list. <br>
					<br>
					Hani bin Muhammad Al Zubair, Chairman of Ominvest, in his 
					report to the shareholders states that the company has an 
					enviable track record of 25 years of uninterrupted profits 
					and dividends. Established in 1983 with a paid up capital of 
					RO8mn the company has achieved an IRR of 16.45 per cent 
					since inception. Market capitalisation on December 31, 2009 
					was RO99mn. Al Zubair advises that the group recorded a 
					consolidated profit of RO22.72mn for 2009 compared to 
					RO20.38mn in 2008, an increase of 11.48 per cent. For the 
					current fiscal year the board has recommended a cash 
					dividend of 10 per cent and a stock dividend of 15 per cent.<br>

					share in spite of the economic turmoil of 2008 continuing 
					into 2009. Contract income increased in 2009 by RO8.9mn (20 
					per cent) when compared to 2008. This increase was mainly 
					due to the healthy order backlog from 2008 and the timely 
					and successful completion of a number of major projects. As 
					a result the company’s profit after tax rose to RO2.64mn.
					<br>
					<br>
					The board of directors recommended a final dividend of 14 
					per cent for the financial year December 31, 2009. Salman 
					states that in order to sustain the production level both 
					for oil and gas, the industry is expected to continue to 
					make significant investments. The company is well positioned 
					to acquire a significant share of this market in the future. 
					Salman adds that due to increased activity in the oil and 
					gas sector in the UAE the company is confident of securing 
					more such jobs in this market as well. Three new companies 
					have entered the ranking of the best five dividend yield 
					companies. Areej Vegetable Oils, Omantel and Sohar Power are 
					newcomers in number one, two and four slots. OIB remains in 
					the number three spot and Raysut Cement remains at number 
					five as last year. <br>
					<br>
					Nasser Bin Muhammed Bin Nasser Al Hadhramy, chairman of 
					Areej Vegetable Oils in his report to the shareholders for 
					the year ended December 31, 2009 states that the company’s 
					new premier brand Khafeef – the lightest frying oil is doing 
					well in Oman and the company has started to tap export 
					markets in 2009. Sales have been stable in 2009 but turnover 
					dropped by 27 per cent due to the impact of lower input cost 
					and consequent lower sales realizations. Al Hadhramy adds 
					that the company managed the price fluctuations in the 
					international vegetable oil market very well and has earned 
					a record net profit after tax of RO1.937mn.<br>
					<br>
					Based on the good results achieved, the board has 
					recommended a dividend of 25 per cent for the year. Al 
					Hadhramy explains that the company has modernised and 
					expanded its oil processing facilities to meet market 
					requirements. The company has also set up a subsidiary in 
					the UAE to handle its direct distribution operations. In 
					addition with increasing market requirements in the related 
					fields of mayonnaise, sauces and dressings, the company 
					plans to diversify its product range and cater this growing 
					market segment. Overall corporate Oman has put up a 
					commendable performance in a difficult year and this holds 
					promise for 2010.</font></td>

					</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In February this 
					year, Omantel, the largest company on the MSM, unveiled its 
					new enhanced brand with new colours and a new tagline, 
					‘Together’. Dr Amer Rawas, CEO, Omantel says it is an 
					important step in the transformation of their unified 
					business and reflects the new vision, mission and values of 
					the corporation. In a candid interview with Visvas Paul D 
					Karra, Dr Rawas talks about Omantel’s evolution in a 
					competitive environment. Excerpts:<br>
					</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					<b>What is the secret behind Omantel’s good performance in 
					the past year despite tough economic conditions?<br>
					</b>I think the rule is that the ability of large companies 
					to respond to disruptive phenomena or technologies becomes 
					slim and I am very proud to say that as a large company we 
					were still able to respond quite rapidly and with some 
					agility to the global slowdown in 2009.<br>
					<br>
					When consumer’s confidence declines their behaviour also 
					gets affected. Therefore, when they are not sure of the 
					future they call less and spend less. Therefore, we have 
					seen the consumer’s trend of fewer calls and more SMS, which 
					costs less but is a more efficient method of communication. 
					We were able to recognise this very early in the game and 
					were able to respond through a number of promotions to 
					stimulate the market.<br>
					<br>
					We believe that internal efficiency measures and cost 
					rationalisation combined with promotional offers to 
					stimulate the usage are the reasons why we were able to 
					arrest the declining trend and increase our profit margins 
					by 5.5 per cent unlike many other companies around. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Can you tell us more about the Omantel-Oman Mobile 
					integration process?<br>
					</b>As a result of the operational and management behaviour 
					that was acquired over the last 40 years, there were some 
					operating inefficiencies in the way we worked. The new 
					operating model eliminated all that with some emphasis on 
					culture change and that has added to our efficiencies.<br>
					<br>
					The merger process has been built into the internal 
					efficiency and cost rationalisation measures that I spoke 
					about. Instead of two companies and two operating models, we 
					joined resources to work as one. Like for example, sales 
					people will now sell both Omantel and Oman Mobile products. 
					This is by far the single biggest contributor to the 
					efficiency and there are other procedures that have been 
					simplified.<br>
					<br>
					We did cost cutting in the area of operational maintenance 
					of the older network. Of course, in 2009, we added a 
					completely new network of 3G and that has introduced new 
					costs. The new network will bring in depreciation and 
					operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs but its like an oil 
					well exploration. It is costly in the short term but your 
					future is secured.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How did people react to the integration process?<br>
					</b>Like any organisation, which is undergoing an 
					integration, there will be people who will support the move 
					and those who will resist. This is why such programmes take 
					a long time. We have taken steps through a programme called 
					‘waiana’ (together with us) cutting across the whole 
					organisation. Basically, it meant listening to the views and 
					ideas of the staff and their aspirations and criticism about 
					the merger process. This has increased the acceptance of the 
					process.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Did the company face challenges in the form of employees 
					who felt they were not given a fair deal and decided to move 
					on?<br>
					</b>If that was the case, one would be defeating the whole 
					purpose of integration. Every company has a normal attrition 
					process and the rate of attrition increased marginally 
					because of the merger process. However, it was fuelled by 
					the sudden increase in the number of new telecom companies, 
					which went up from two to seven. This created new job 
					opportunities.<br>
					<br>
					The attrition process affected both companies but because 
					most of the new operators were mobile companies, Oman Mobile 
					got affected more. This is something we were expecting and 
					we had planned for, which in turn limited the damage.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Please explain about the new hierarchy after the 
					restructuring process.<br>
					</b>As per international norms, telecom companies have 
					vicepresidents managing various verticals of the company. 
					However, where telecom companies differ around the world is 
					on the type of verticals and how you divide them. Some 
					companies divide their verticals functionally, while some 
					divide it based on products. Our verticals centred around 
					our customers are known as customer centric hierarchy. So we 
					have three different VPs managing different verticals like 
					corporate, consumers and wholesale consumers.<br>
					<br>
					It takes time to show the desired fruit but we are further 
					consolidating the operating model with resources, process 
					and tools to get more results out of this.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Omantel is the largest listed company. Is the size of a 
					company a benchmark for its performance?<br>
					</b>I would always link size to revenues and I think that is 
					perhaps the best judge. And large companies around the world 
					have gone through various cycles of splits and mergers to 
					control size and grow their bottom line and top line.<br>
					<br>
					Omantel has gone through two cycles and both were timely and 
					came at a time when the dynamics of the market demanded 
					these moves. This reflects the ability of the organisation 
					to respond to the environment around it. And I do not think 
					the size in terms of the revenues or the capitalisation has 
					been a problem for us. The size in terms of the number of 
					staff who were hired over the last 40 years remains a 
					challenge for us. We are working on an option wherein we are 
					going to increase our productivity to offset any 
					inefficiencies due to the size.<br>
					<br>
					<b>How do you critically evaluate your company?<br>
					</b>Considering the level of market liberalisation that has 
					has happened in a short span of time, I think the company 
					has done well. In the last ten years, we have moved from 
					being a government organisation (GTO) to Omantel, which is a 
					government owned closed company. Then it became two 
					companies, a public company; and now it is a unified 
					organisation again. Six major transformations and all were 
					necessary because of the changing environment and because of 
					the government policy to first privatise and then to 
					liberalise. But that is all compounded by a very fast 
					liberalisation process. So within the same ten years we have 
					seen how the market has changed from a monopoly operator six 
					years ago to three operators and now seven telecom 
					operators. For any company this is a tough journey within 
					ten years but I think we have done well.<br>
					<br>
					<b>The criticism against Omantel is that it wer unable to 
					serve its customers better than its competition<br>
					</b>Omantel was a monopoly company until Nawras came along 
					in 2004. And all monopolies around the world act alike. 
					Right? Then when competition came up, Omantel was able to 
					spring up with its mobile arm – Oman Mobile, which was able 
					to deal with its customers in line with competition. That is 
					why they were able to protect our market. Meanwhile, the 
					other part of the company (Omantel) started to transform 
					itself anticipating enhanced competition.<br>
					One of the most important driver for our transformation 
					stems from the recognition that for a monopoly to transform 
					into a competitive environment, you need to transform into a 
					customer-centric organisation. And that’s what we have been 
					doing over the last one year.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Perhaps with the status of a monopoly and the fact that 
					you have to deal with competition, the victim has been 
					customer service<br>
					</b>When Nawras was awarded the second fixed line licence in 
					September 2008, we stopped being a monopoly. By then, the 
					company had merged its operating model into a customer 
					centric model with a view to offset its perceived weakness. 
					But that is not a weakness that is peculiar to Omantel. It 
					is something that all monopolies suffer from. But the good 
					monopolies are those who transform themselves and we have 
					done that successfully in Omantel and I have no doubt that 
					we will succeed in the fixed line area as well.<br>
					<br>
					The customer service challenges in the fixed line area are 
					more to do with the topography of the country. You have an 
					urban development philosophy that is based on villas than 
					high-rise buildings so if you get to the foot of high-rise 
					building you would get 600 accounts. But here in the villas 
					you have a 50-50 chance of getting a customer.<br>
					<br>
					But what we have done during the last one year is we have 
					come closer to customers to basically improve our return on 
					investments by expanding our fixed network through what is 
					called MSANs – a neighbourhood exchange centre where you 
					bring the capacity closer to the customer.<br>
					<br>
					<b>As a CEO, how did you keep up the morale of your staff in 
					the troubling days of the past year?<br>
					</b>One of the main characteristic of a leader is to 
					understand the situation, recognise its challenges, 
					communicate it well to the team and then work with them on a 
					mitigation or a solution policy. And that is what I did. 
					This is a new form of engagement. By intensifying the 
					engagement with the stakeholders, namely the board, the 
					management, staff and key customers, we were able to win 
					their confidence. This worked well for me.<br>
					<br>
					<b>You were an academician earlier in your career. Has that 
					grounding helped you in Omantel?<br>
					</b>There are two types of academicians. Those who are 
					teaching and those involved in management. I have been 
					involved in leading teams. I had a dean and director’s role. 
					As a dean I was managing six centres, which means a large 
					population of staff. <br>
					<br>
					I brought in leadership and managerial skills from the 
					academia. I also brought in my technical expertise from 
					teaching and supervising projects. If you are a teacher of 
					three subjects, which I was, I had hundred per cent 
					attrition every three months. And every time they come with 
					a new set of challenges, thinking, and attitudes. A lot of 
					people management is required and most often a teacher’s 
					role in managing people is not recognised. All this helped 
					me.<br>
					<br>
					<b>With over 140 per cent market penetration, the telecom 
					market has become highly competitive. How do you look at the 
					future?<br>
					</b>In a market that is fully saturated with more than 140 
					per cent penetration it is challenging for all players. You 
					can continue to fight the game of adding subscribers, 
					announcing new market shares etc. Or you can do what we are 
					trying to do and that is to give better service to our 
					customers. It is very important for us to remain the market 
					leader therefore we are not going to withdraw from the 
					competition for new subscribers.<br>
					<br>
					<b>However we are laying more emphasis on satisfying our 
					existing customers <br>
					</b>who are our bread and butter. But it is going to be very 
					challenging for everyone, and not just Omantel. </font></td>

					full of challenges but Shell Oman Marketing Company found 
					opportunities in this environment by focussing on cost 
					reduction, delivering its plans and fostering a performance 
					driven culture. All these helped the company to achieve good 
					results, writes Visvas Paul D Karra<br>
					</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Shell Oman Marketing Company (SOMC) achieved unprecedented 
					financial results amidst an unsettled global economic 
					environment and recorded the highest-ever net profit in its 
					history after tax of RO13.02mn compared to the previous 
					year’s net profit after tax of RO12.5mn. Despite the 
					uncertainty surrounding major global economies, the 
					company’s proactive management, as well as sound operational 
					performance were the principal drivers of SOMC’s commendable 
					financial performance in 2009.<br>
					<br>
					As a result of higher net income, the earnings per share for 
					2009 moved upwards to 130 bzs, compared to 125 bzs in 2008. 
					The final dividend of RO12mn i.e. 120 bzs per share 
					represents an increase of 4.4 per cent over the previous 
					year’s total final dividend of RO11.5mn.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Effective initiatives<br>
					</b>Such outstanding results have stemmed from the company’s 
					focus on cost-cutting initiatives that included all areas of 
					its business, in areas such as distribution, lubricants 
					blending as well as administrative and operating expenses. 
					The credit position has been monitored with more stringent 
					policies in place to manage any credit exposure and this has 
					further improved SOMC’s cash flow positions while minimising 
					any credit issues. SOMC’s turnover comes mainly from its 
					retail business, which contributes 53 per cent, while the 
					rest is from commercial fuels (21 per cent); lubricants (14 
					per cent); and aviation (12 per cent).<br>
					<br>
					An upbeat Faisal Al Hashar, managing director, SOMC says 
					that the script for this success story was planned much 
					before the actual impact of the global economic crisis. “In 
					a team of both Senior and middle management, we began by 
					working on the Vision 55 goal in which the company 
					envisioned two different scenarios in the middle of 2008 
					itself. One is what if oil prices collapse and the other was 
					what if the oil prices went up. And where would the 
					organisation be in these two situations and how to manage 
					the situations,” says Al Hashar.<br>
					<br>
					Continuing further he says, “I believe as an organisation, 
					we have once again exceeded our targets and in a number of 
					areas too. First, the team had delivered on a massive cost 
					reduction that covered all the areas of our businesses. This 
					has greatly influenced our ability to compete in an ever 
					increasingly competitive market but also allowed us the 
					flexibility to manoeuvre our business in accordance to the 
					prevailing market.”<br>
					<br>
					<b>Anticipatory measures<br>
					</b>This has been more specific to SOMC’s lubricants 
					blending plant where the exports were around 80 per cent. 
					For example, in 2008 the plant achieved a production of 
					around 100 million litres of lubricants while in 2009, the 
					plant production was scaled down to near 77 million litres. 
					The cost base required to service a 100 million is far 
					greater than 77 million and at the same time it was easier 
					to build and invest to meet increased demand rather than 
					having to adjust costs in a market that is shrinking.<br>
					<br>
					The reputation for high quality lubricants has enabled the 
					company to achieve higher penetration in both the local and 
					export markets despite the volatile economic conditions. A 
					project to repackage lubricants to attract both existing and 
					new customers was completed by the end of Q3, 2009. In 
					addition, the inland lubricants team has managed to renew 
					key contracts as well as gain new ones that have greatly 
					contributed to business growth.<br>
					<br>
					The company also initiated cost-cutting measures, and as Al 
					Hashar mentions, it was fantastic how the people reacted and 
					began to contribute to these measures. First of all, while 
					other organisations cut down on salaries, SOMC did not cut 
					down on HR benefits as it believes that people are its most 
					important assets.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Sound credit management<br>
					</b>“Another important thing which I also mentioned in last 
					year’s top OER Top 20 Debate and Awards Presentation 
					function in 2009, at CMA, is that our company will be 
					focusing on the generation of cash from its balance sheet, 
					will focus on costs reduction and will further focus on 
					enhancing our services to our customers.. We tightened the 
					belt by reducing the credit days, and it was amazing to see 
					how much cash was there in our hands. Moving forward, we 
					want to maintain these measures because the efficiency was 
					so great like for example we realised how fast an invoice 
					can be prepared. So our credit management showed a major 
					improvement with significant reduction in sales 
					outstanding,” adds Al Hashar. <br>
					<br>
					On the retail business side, SOMC focussed on three areas – 
					network development, operational excellence and marketing – 
					which produced the desired results. The growth initiatives 
					were led by investments in new-to-industry (NTI) sites; 
					rebuilding of old sites, focussing on consistently 
					delivering excellence in site operations and sustained 
					marketing efforts.<br>
					<br>
					Four old sites were rebuilt while six NTI sites were 
					commissioned taking the network number to 139 till date. 
					Here again, the company wisely took advantage of the decline 
					in construction costs to build the sites and was able to 
					reduce costs. The retail marketshare remains the highest and 
					is fairly stable in the face of an ever-growing number of 
					new sites introduced in the market. The average throughput 
					per site (ATP) stands at 9.72 million litres in 2009 and the 
					company’s retail sales grew by one per cent year-on-year. 
					August 2009 saw the highest-ever Shell Oman monthly sale of 
					122 million litres.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Reliability pays<br>
					</b>Many business factors changed in the aviation market in 
					the year 2009, and in early 2010 SOMC lost Oman Air contract 
					to its competitor. “We offer value to our customers that is 
					supported by outstanding service “end-to-end” and we try to 
					avoid offers that are based on price undercutting” says Al 
					Hashar.<br>
					<br>
					Nevertheless, he adds the company has important customers 
					like Royal Air Force of Oman (RAFO); Ministry of Defence etc 
					who want a company like SOMC that delivers on its promise 
					with reliability and enhanced customer value proposition. 
					The company continues to supply its fuel and services to 
					RAFO four bases in Masirah, Thumrait, Musandam and Salalah. 
					Further, in 2009, SOMC also bagged a contract to supply fuel 
					to all airlines that fly from India into Muscat 
					International Airport till April 2012.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Drawing customers<br>
					</b>Al Hashar says that the company enhanced its customer 
					service like efficiencies in delivery, invoicing and filling 
					on time etc which helped Shell Oman to gain more customers. 
					That created a barrier for customers to move out and in fact 
					the company gained more customers. “If you look at our 
					toplines the reductions in sales were not that big, whereas 
					if you look at the bottom lines we had huge growth in terms 
					of NIAT (net income after taxes) because of all the 
					processes that were put in place to manage and serve the 
					customers better.”<br>
					<br>
					All the sites have also been modernised, involving 
					significant investments, right from the underground tanks, 
					to toilets and all the way to the canopy to make sure that 
					customers see Shell Oman as the best. At the time of filling 
					also, we enhanced the customer experience in simple ways 
					like how the customer is greeted, cleaning the windshield 
					etc.<br>
					<br>
					All of this helped in drawing a lot of motorists to Shell 
					sites. There was an acceptable volume of increase at the 
					sites and this way the retail business has contributed 
					significantly to the results of the company.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Downstream One<br>
					</b>Shell Oman is excited about a new project, Downstream 
					One, which has been supported by the Board and approved by 
					the company’s shareholders at the last AGM. The project will 
					be costing around RO6mn over a 2 year period. Downstream One 
					works through a process known as ESSA, which in other words 
					means eliminate, standardise, simplify and automate.<br>
					<br>
					The strategy is to differentiate itself from the competitors 
					right from the fuel the company offers, to a whole new 
					customer experience. This would put the company in a 
					different league altogether. Although this programme may 
					affect the company’s bottomline in the short term, it will 
					deliver more value to shareholders in the long run. <br>

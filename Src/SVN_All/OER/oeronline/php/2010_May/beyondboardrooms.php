					Suleym Al Junaibi, now aged 41, hails from the Wilayat of 
					Duqm in the Al Wusta Region. In his early years he aspired 
					to be a police officer.
					</b>Despite such aspirations, his first job opportunity came 
					in the form of an administrative clerk in the Ministry of 
					Health. Although it wasn’t what he initially desired, this 
					post enabled him to develop his skills and capabilities. It 
					even helped him to learn and master the English language 
					before moving to Royal Hospital, where he got a job as an 
					assistant administrative officer.<br>
					<b><br>
					</b>Soon after in 1987, he was chosen as an administrative 
					officer at the Haima Hospital in the central region. 
					Although he was only 18 years of age at the time, he 
					effectively managed a cadre of doctors and nurses of more 
					than 40 members. He served for 22 years in the government 
					and then turned to serving the nation through the private 
					sector. He looked at starting his own company, so that he 
					could apply his own ideas for the development of the 
					society. <br>
					<br>
                    <b>Entrepreneurial streak<br>
					</b>His decision to resign from his government position and 
					concentrate on developing a self sufficient company in the 
					oil and gas field, proved to be a turning point in his 
					career. The company, called ‘Al-ghalbi Trading and 
					Contracting’, started with less than five employees in 1998 
					in a small rented building. Today, it employs more than 500 
					employees, with a very good Omanisation percentage. The 
					company got an ISO 9001:2000 certification in 2003 and 
					recently renewed it with an ISO 9001:2008. It changed to an 
					international setup, both by changing the name to Al-ghalbi 
					International Engineering and Contracting and by adopting 
					and implementing international methodologies and standards. 
					The company has successfully completed ministry contracts 
					and prestigious orders from various multinational companies. 
					It currently has contracts from the Ministry of Finance, 
					PDO, Occidental Mukhaizna, ORPC etc.<b><br>
					<br>
					Leisure pursuits<br>
					</b>Apart from work Ali’s main interests include travelling, 
					both domestic and international. He uses travelling as an 
					excuse for monitoring business developments and 
					opportunities. He has travelled throughout the Sultanate by 
					road and has visited Australia, Azerbaijan, Lebanon, Egypt, 
					India, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh and nearly every major 
					country in the Middle East. “I like to travel outside Oman 
					to discover new business ventures. I regularly meet with 
					international business heads to share ideas and jointly 
					expand the scope of our business,” says Ali. Even during 
					weekends, one will normally find him driving to the 
					interiors to meet his employees and client representative. 
					While there, he also makes it a point to visit his friends. 
					A firm believer and practitioner of charity, Ali always 
					takes the initiative to provide assistance. These include 
					educational assistance, help in building houses, assistance 
					for treatments and more. In spite of all that he does and 
					his busy schedule, he gives importance to his family life, 
					spending as much time with them as possible and sparing good 
					hours for his family, by properly managing his travel and 
					official plans. According to him, the most important quality 
					for success is to be fair at work. He adds, “If we have a 
					fair mind to work, all things will come our way, including 
					concentration, sincerity, quality etc.” <b><br>

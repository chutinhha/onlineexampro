        Networks is revolutionizing the economics of global information 
        exchange. Our purpose-built, high-performance IP platforms enable 
        customers to support many different services and applications at scale.

        institutions worldwide rely on the company to deliver products for 
        building networks that are tailored to the individual needs of their 
        users, services, and applications.<br>
        <br>
        “Our customers in the Middle East derive strategic value from their 
        networks, constantly facing trade-offs in their efforts to deliver a 
        secure and dependable experience for their users,” commented Mohamad 
        Abdul Malak, managing director, Juniper Networks Middle East and Africa. 
        “Regional businesses are increasingly protecting their infrastructure in 
        the face of increasingly sophisticated and frequent security attacks, as 
        well as having to balance these security requirements with the need to 
        provide an open and flexible network services to users. They have to 
        balance sophisticated intelligence at scale, with their need for 
        superior performance, and leverage the flexibility and economics of the 
        Internet, as well as building security and reliability into their 
        private networks. Our experts are situated across the region poised to 
        help our customers create a high-performance infrastructure that enables 
        security and networking to work together.”<br>
        With this type of infrastructure, Juniper Networks customers understand 
        not only who their users are, but also what they are allowed to do on 
        the network. The delivery and performance of communications based on the 
        needs of the application and the user are ensured.<br>
        <br>
        Only Juniper Networks can deliver this secure, dependable infrastructure 
        for customers with strategic networking requirements. A leader in 
        innovation, the company has a solid track record of delivering 
        best-in-class networking and security products to solve the industry's

        Juniper Networks innovations and highly scalable, reliable networking 
        and security platforms to deliver the best user experience with the 
        lowest total cost of operations.<br>
        <br>
        According to Infonetics Research, Juniper Networks continues to be the 
        market share leader in the Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network 
        (SSL VPN) market with 33 percent market share in 2005, which was more 
        than double the next ranking competitor. Juniper Networks is positioned 
        by Gartner, Inc. in the &quot;Leaders&quot; quadrant of the recently published 
        3Q05 North America Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL VPN) 
        report.<br>
        <br>
        In the region, Jordan Telecom, the leading Jordanian telecommunications 
        provider, announced in early 2006 that they have deployed the Juniper 
        Networks Integrated Security Gateway (ISG) series firewall and virtual 
        private network (FW/VPN) systems and Juniper Networks Intrusion 
        Detection and Prevention (IDP) platforms to protect its corporate 
        network infrastructure against worms, trojans, spyware and other 
        emerging threats, as well as application layer threats. Delivering on 
        the Enterprise Infranet framework, the Juniper Networks ISG platforms 
        can be operated as a single firewall/VPN service or with IDP as an 
        elective add-on to provide enterprise customers with increased levels of 
        delivery and threat control.<br>

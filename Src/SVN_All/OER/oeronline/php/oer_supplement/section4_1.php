        <img border="1" src="siemens_2.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="74">First 
        Omantel, and then Oman Mobile and Nawras, are taking center stage in the 
        success of Oman’s telecommunication industry. Have you ever wondered 
        what makes these service providers continue to make their end number of 
        services available to millions of users in the Sultanate? They all are 
        powered by the global giants and their local partners in kick starting 
        and running their operations smoothly 24x7. Siemens, Ericsson, Cisco, 
        Huawei and Microsoft etc. are running their operations in Oman to manage 
        the infrastructure related requirements of the three telecom service 
        providers. Encouraged by the fast growth in the telecom industry, these 
        companies are expanding their operations in Oman and investing in 
        deploying more resources. <br>
        <br>
        Siemens has been managing telecom projects in the Sultanate since 1977. 
        A separate dedicated Siemens Muscat Branch was established in 1982. 
        According to Ralf Fueller, GM, Siemens Muscat Branch, “Siemens has a 
        major expansion plan up its sleeve to further strengthen its role as a 
        partner in the development of the telecommunications industry in Oman. 
        With the opening of the sector and the introduction of new technologies, 
        a host of business expansion opportunities are available to us now.” 
        Omantel and Oman Mobile are Siemens’ primary customers in Oman.<br>
        Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Technical Office Oman, is a branch 
        office of the telecommunications giant Ericsson AB (Telefonaktiebolaget 
        LM Ericsson), of Stockholm, Sweden. Ericsson is associated with Oman for 
        more than two decades as it got registered with the Ministry of Commerce 
        &amp; Industry in 1974 and has ever since been actively present here with 
        many telecommunications projects undertaken for Omantel and Oman Mobile.<br>
        <br>
        The Sultanate of Oman has always been a key market for Cisco Systems and 
        as part of its commitment to public and private organizations within the 
        country; Cisco continues to deliver differentiated value through its 
        flagship portfolio of products and solutions which are closely mapped to 
        satisfy customers’ needs. Cisco is expected to open its full-fledged 
        office in Oman in the next 12-18 months to tap the growing business 
        opportunity in the Sultanate. <br>
        <br>
        Microsft’s business in Oman is expanding rapidly, as per Abdullatif Al 
        Mulla, General Manager, Microsoft South Gulf. “Microsoft is working with 
        a number of government departments and public organizations across Oman 
        to give the people of Oman access to technology and IT skills to help 
        them realize their full potential. We have appointed Sami Al-Lawati to 
        the position of Business Development Manager for Oman recently. Sami is 
        an Omani national and he is heading our team in Oman,” he added.<br>

        Siemens Muscat Though Siemens has been executing telecom projects in the 
        Sultanate since 1977 but a separate dedicated Siemens Muscat Branch was 
        established in 1982 only. According to Ralf Fueller, GM, Siemens Muscat 
        Branch, “Siemens has a major expansion plan up its sleeve to further

        <br>
        All the projects were carried out on a turnkey basis successfully since 
        the beginning. Simultaneously, to meet the subscriber demand, expansions 
        were carried out periodically.<br>
        <br>
        It had also established an International Digital Gateway Exchange during 
        the year 1985 and the same was expanded during the year 1996.<br>
        <br>
        The concluded prestigious projects executed by Siemens includes:<br>
        • Introduction of xDSL, Media gateways, Media gateway Controller and 
        Edge Routers for the IP-Plane within the project “Next Generation 
        Network Step 1”. Omantel is a forerunner in the region.<br>
        • A second Siemens International Gateway Exchange featuring the latest 
        technology was established in 2001.<br>
        • Replacement of the existing O&amp;M Centre with the very latest 
        technology, namely NetManager<br>
        • Various expansions of the existing exchanges and upgrading of certain 
        Remote Exchanges to a Parent Exchange, along with the latest software 
        upgrade of the Coordination Processor as well as Access Nodes.<br>
        <img border="0" src="siemens2.jpg" align="left" width="118" height="148"><br>
        The latest projects contracted include the introduction of a 
        next-generation SS7 signalling overlay network with SURPASS hiS and the 
        nationwide upgrade of TDM switching systems to the latest APS software 
        version V15S. This has provided Omantel with a future-proof platform as 
        the next step towards a Next Generation Network. The most recent project 
        implemented is the introduction of ADSL service which was successfully 
        launched in December 2004.<br>
        <br>
        At present, Siemens’ PSTN network capacity in the Sultanate is around 
        300,000 ports. It also continues to support Omantel in its plans to 
        modernize its network towards Next Generation Networks technologies.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Mobile Telecommunications (PLMN)<br>
        </b><br>
        Siemens has completely build the very first GSM Network in the Sultanate 
        with a capacity of 100,000 subscribers in Muscat Governorate and Salalah 
        Area. The service was launched during the National Day 1996. In the next 
        years, Siemens did further GSM expansions in Salalah, Wusta and Dhofar 
        Governorate.<br>
        <br>
        In 2000, Siemens was awarded, the first ever IN (Intelligent Network) 
        platform for the establishment in the Sultanate. The first phase of the 
        project was successfully implemented within a short time frame. The 
        public was surprised by the company’s customer, Omantel, with the 
        introduction of Prepaid Cards “Hayyak” &amp; “Jibreen” for mobile and fixed 
        subscribers, respectively.<br>
        <br>
        In 2001, Siemens was entrusted with further expansions of the mobile 
        network in Salalah and rural areas including Dakhiliya, Dahira and 
        Sharqia. In addition, a new MSC/VLR was also established at Nizwa.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="1" src="siemens3.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="97">The 
        IN platform capacity was doubled by Siemens in 2003 to meet the 
        tremendous growth rate of pre-paid subscribers. Omantel/Oman Mobile 
        awarded a further major project to Siemens for the expansion of GSM 
        Services in Dakhelia/Dhahira and Sharqiya regions including two new MSCs. 
        Additionally, the establishment of 2 new Gateway MSC as well as GPRS and 
        MMS technology for post- and pre-paid GSM subscribers were part of the 
        project.<br>
        <br>
        Siemens continued its success in 2005 with contracts for major expansion 
        of the IN platform and the radio network; including the introduction of 
        EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Evolution) technology. The prestigious project 
        of “Mobile Number Portability” for the Omantel and Oman Mobile network 
        was awarded to Siemens recently. This project will play a major role in 
        the further evolution of the telecommunications market in the Sultanate.
        <br>
        <br>
        Soenke Peters, VP Siemens Communications Mobile Networks Middle East, 
        said, “With such longstanding interests in the Sultanate, Siemens 
        remains committed to working with partners like Omantel and Oman Mobile 
        to provide the country with a world-class telecom network and give the 
        people of Oman access to the latest telecom services.”<br>
        <br>
        In addition to Siemens’ comprehensive business interests in the 
        Sultanate, the German company is also one of the leading corporate 
        advocates of Omanisation, supporting a wide range of government-led 
        initiatives and establishing the Centre of Excellence for Telecom

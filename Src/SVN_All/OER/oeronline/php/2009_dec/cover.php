                    of economic growth. H E Macki’s budget pegged government expenditure 
                    for 2009 at $6.4bn, a 11 per cent increase over the preceding 
                    year giving a resounding sense of confidence to businesses

                    in 1977. The automobile major had earlier filed for bankruptcy 
                    and was bailed out by the US government. Wagoner had already

                    Chancellor Angela Merkel won a second term in September 2009, 
                    along with the center-right majority that eluded her four

                    right as it claws its way out of a deep recession. Merkel’s 
                    second four-year term is expected to be markedly different 
                    from her first, in which she presided over a middle-of-the-road

                    (1991), and History (1995) among the best selling. He is widely

                    A vaccine is not exactly a novel invention, but one that’s 
                    designed to fight HIV certainly is. More than 20 years after 
                    the AIDS virus was identified, researchers have devised the 
                    first immunisation to protect people against HIV infection. 
                    A six-year trial showed that the vaccine, which consists of 
                    two shots that given individually had failed to protect against 
                    HIV, is modestly effective, reducing infection in 31 per cent 
                    among those receiving the regimen versus those getting a placebo. 
                    But scientists are still trying to figure out how the vaccine

                    patients who lose a knee joint have few options: a titanium 
                    replacement can cost $10,000, and crude models don’t work 
                    very well. Now a team of Stanford engineering students has

                    group of Italian scientists are working on. They’re using 
                    wood - red oak, rattan and sipo work best - to create an artificial 
                    bone replacement called carbonated hydroxyapatite. Because 
                    of the sponginess of the wood, live bones are expected to 
                    grow into the structure faster than with traditional titanium 
                    or ceramic implants, decreasing the time it takes to mend 
                    a broken bone. The procedure isn’t quite ready for human testing, 
                    so sheep are currently testing the artificial bones. Researchers 
                    say that with the bone substitute, which takes approximately 
                    one week to process, they can create virtually any size or

                    The Dow Chemical Co has developed a new roof shingle that 
                    doubles as a solar panel. The shingles, which can be incorporated 
                    into rooftops alongside traditional asphalt shingles, use 
                    low-cost thin-film cells of copper indium gallium diselenide.

                    to 15 per cent less than traditional solar panels and will

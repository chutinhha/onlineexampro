                    Mukesh Luthra, the Chairman, of VLCC Health Care Limited, 
                    has always been working with and for women, infact he started 
                    his career in fashion buying products for many major labels, 
                    namely JC Penny and Macy’s, from India and elsewhere in Asia. 
                    “I used to live in the US and my employers felt that since 
                    I knew India and other Asian countries well I would do a better 
                    job. Whatever a fashion designer used to design, I would get 
                    that manufactured in Asia have them exported to the labels 
                    I worked for,” says Luthra. <br>
                    <br>
                    Vandana Luthra, his wife, started VLCC in 1989 and by 2000 
                    she had seven centres up and running. The business gained 
                    traction and turned the business into a successful delivery 
                    process brand. Luthra joined her in 2000 and soon developed 
                    a business model with her. Together they started to wrap up 
                    between 35 to 40 centres per year and eventually had 245 centres 
                    in 75 cities in India and 13 in the Middle East. “We chose 
                    the Middle East because it has a high impact of diabetes and 
                    obesity and we believe that we could actually make a difference 
                    here,” says Luthra. “Our second centre in Oman opened recently 
                    and our second centre in Bahrain will open soon followed by 
                    Qatar, Kuwait and finally Saudi Arabia. By 2011 we plan to 
                    move into Egypt, Africa and North America,” he added.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Spreading its wings</b> <br>
                    He setup the VLCC institute of Health and Beauty in 2000 with 
                    their own systems and a large R&amp;D which created the syllabus. 
                    VLCC now has 51 institutes in 40 cities in India and their 
                    first international institute will be opening right here in 
                    Oman before the end of 2009. Due to the nature of his position, 
                    Luthra is always on the move travelling from one area to another 
                    which can be very stressful. He de-stresses by involving himself 
                    in physical activities such as playing cricket. He also enjoys 
                    watching cricket and comedy movies. Old Hindi songs with meaningful 
                    lyrics namely by Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh are his other 
                    abiding favourites. When asked about what would be his ideal 
                    day, he quipped “Lazing around, reading newspapers and magazines 
                    and seeing what is happening around the world.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Being a father of two daughters he keeps telling himself, 
                    “Daughters are daughters all their life and sons are sons 
                    only till they get a wife. So I believe that they will always 
                    be there for me and so I am pleased. And being a husband of 
                    a successful lady in business also feels good,” quite easily 
                    turning around the cliché, “behind every successful man is 
                    a woman.” Unfortunately, for a man who can’t live without 
                    work, all the travelling also prevents him from seeing his 
                    family often so he cherishes every minute spent with them. 
                    His last words - Eat well, be healthy and enjoy a long and 
                    happy life. <br>

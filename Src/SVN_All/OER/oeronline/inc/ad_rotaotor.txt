AD_ROTATOR IN PHP3 
BY: MARK DONCHEK
E: MARK@MARKDONLINE.COM

This script is ideal for rotating a few ads on a small site without comittiing to an elaborate 
database system.  Since each ad is stored in its own include file,
it can contain HTML, quotes, semicolons, etc which may throw other scripts off.


1. Simply cut and paste all of this code in a php doc where you want your ad to appear.
2. create an include file for each ad.  
3. copy all necessary code for the ad into its respective include.
4. change the var $randomnumber to accomodate the number of ads you have.
   where 'x' = one less than the number of ads you have:
*/

srand((double)microtime()*1000000); 
$randomnumber = rand(0,x); // change the second number if need be (see number 4 above)

/*
5. change "your_path/any_ad.inc" for each ad you have
6. alter the number of elseifs to accomodate the number of includes if necessary (ads).
*/



$include0 = "bk.inc"; 
$include1 = "oer.inc";

if 	($randomnumber== "0") {
	include ("$include0");

	} else if ($randomnumber== "1") {
	include("$include1");
	
		} else if ($randomnumber== "2") {
	include("$include2");
	
		} 	
	
	
	} else {
	
	echo ("ERROR: A random num is being generated out of range, or not at all ");	
	}

All these changes have to fix as earlier as possible to get out of Google's hit.

1. Canonical Issue- no .htaccess file. (tell them to use canonical relation- 301 permanent redirection code- to get rid of issues such as crawl error of with 'www.' and without 'www.')

2. No valid sitemap- suggest them to upload sitemap.xml- .xml format and resubmit in webmaster. Google accepts 'xml' only at present. So it has sitemap error.

3. No robots.txt file. Suggest them to upload it in webserver.

4. Too many No-follow links in homepage. Reduce it.

5. No valid/non-informative title tag @ http://i-constech.com/contact.aspx we need informative title, so Google'll consider it. Also, make no-follow for all footer links in the same page.

6. No title tag for

http://www.i-constech.com/Homecustomresult.aspx and this page s not required http://www.i-constech.com/Error.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/About.aspx

7. Many duplicate meta descriptions found from webmaster. We should fix that too.

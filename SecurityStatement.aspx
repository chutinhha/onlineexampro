                Infiniti Clothing limits the number of employees that have access to the databases
                that contain personal data, and Infiniti Clothing employees are advised of the importance
                of confidentiality. In addition, it is our policy to never send your payment card
                number via email. As an added safeguard, Infiniticlothing.com does not store payment
                card information with your online account.<br />
                We designed the Infiniticlothing.com online store to accept orders only from Web
                browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
                Browsers that do not meet this requirement will be prevented from navigating the
                online store section of the Website. See "Supported Web Browsers" for more information.
                While we implement the above security measures on this site,you should be aware
                that 100% security is not always possible.

<img border="0" src="manage4.jpg" width="196" height="210" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Neuro-linguistic 
programming (NLP) is a set of techniques, axioms and beliefs that adherents use 
primarily as an approach to personal development. It is based on the idea that 
mind, body and language interact to create an individual's perception of the 
world and that perceptions, and hence behaviors, can be changed by the 
application of a variety of techniques; in particular, “modeling” which involves 
the careful reproduction of the behaviors and beliefs of those who have achieved 
‘excellence’. The early focus of NLP was the study of the underlying patterns in 
the language and techniques of noted and successful therapists in hypnotherapy, 
gestalt therapy and family therapy. The patterns discovered were adapted for 
general communication and effecting change.<br>
<br>
NLP has been coordinated within some industry associations, psychotherapy 
associations, and has been used or suggested as an approach by some mental 
health bodies. NLP has influenced some corporate executive coaches who provide 
one-on-one training and collaborative relationships to executives interested in 
development skills in career or business and may help resolve related personal 
issues. <br>
<br>
Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) has had a profound impact on the field of 
personal development since it was first developed, nearly twenty-five years ago. 
NLP has been described as the new science of personal achievement, but it is 
much more than that. Pioneers in the field of NLP have identified the key 
factors that can help YOU become more effective, successful and fulfilled. Few 
of the outcomes of attending an NLP program are to set compelling outcomes – the 
keys to achieving your goals, Increase your flexibility and maximize your 
choice, To become more powerful in your communication and your approach to life, 
Become aware of the different ways we take in and process information, Be 
introduced to the empowering Presuppositions of NLP that create the foundation 
for your personal development.<br>
<br>
Leadership, in a nutshell, is about creating a compelling vision and motivating 
people to achieve it. Today, more businesses are focusing on developing their 
leaders. Leadership is key for everyone and hence Gazelle thought of bringing in 
NLP – “Inner Leader for our corporate clients in the Sultanate,” says Benosn 
Marketing Manager, Gazelle International.<br>

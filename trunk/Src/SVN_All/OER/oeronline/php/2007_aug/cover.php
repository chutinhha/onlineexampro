<b>Al Duqm is hardly a destination for the average tourist or leisure-traveller, 
leave alone industrialists. But come 2010, Oman’s most comprehensively planned 
town will blip on the global industrial radar like no other Omani city. P Aneel 
Kumar takes you to the road to Duqm</b></font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">During the period of what they call ‘the flood’, the miniscule population of Al 
Duqm migrates to northern parts to find some work in date fields. During this 
period (from June to September), the temperature drops below 30 deg C, which is 
unsuitable for fishing – the lifeline of the town. Perhaps by next year, this 
‘summer journey’ might stop. For the topography of the area is up for some 
makeover – a makeover worth hundreds of millions of riyals.<br>
<br>
What is considered now as a sleepy, fishing town is soon expected to eclipse the 
Sultanate’s fast-developing industrial hub, Sohar. It might sound like an 
exaggeration, but Duqm, if all goes according to the master plan, will be a 
force to reckon with in the entire Gulf region in the days to come. Though only 
bits and pieces of information about Duqm’s development as a new industrial 
destination is available, the plans for development of the area include a crude 
oil export terminal and a strategic storage facility, a free trade zone and a 
downstream industrial area in addition to an airport, port, dry dock, commercial 
and residential areas and plans for tourism development. Thanks to its proximity 
to the busy regional sea-lanes traversing Oman’s coastal waters, Duqm – about 
700 kms from Muscat – is being conceived as a main maritime gateway that will 
serve an ambitious industrial and commercial hub. Apart from the strategic 
location of Duqm, the friendly climate of the area adds to its advantages.<br>
<br>
The purpose behind developing Duqm is to export Gulf’s crude oil from an Omani 
port. Outline of the plan is to export crude oil, which is produced in the Gulf 
region and transported through pipeline to Omani port. Positioned as it is on 
the Gulf of Oman, with the Strait of Hormuz and the Arabian Sea at its 
north-eastern end, and with its long coastline running south along the Arabian 
Sea, the government believes Duqm is strategically the most preferred location 
for this port.<br>
<br>
The biggest catch for Duqm could be its mineral export capability. The total dry 
bulk cargo handled at Duqm in 2025 is estimated to be four million tonnes. The 
exports of aggregate will comprise limestone for steel industry and limestone 
fillers for other industries as well silica sand/quartzite. Most importantly, 
the port will handle a substantial portion of the fish export from Oman. It is 
estimated that in 2025, the total fish catch of Sultanate of Oman will be 
250,000 tonnes, and about 50 per cent of it will be exported. Share of the catch 
and the export from the ports are likely to be like this: Sultan Qaboos – 35 per 
cent, Duqm – 27 per cent, and Salalah – 13 per cent.<br>
<br>
Not just this. Al Wusta Region is distinguished for having a great number of oil 
wells. One of the possibilities could be setting up a space-oriented industry 
such as oil refinery and storage. “As the Sultanate is also looking to further 
strengthening its links with the sea and maritime trade, it is seeking to 
position itself as the region’s leading ship-repair centre by constructing a 
massive new dry dock and maintenance facility. The Sultanate has already poured 
billions of dollars into developing the ports of Muscat, Sohar and Salalah to 
boost the cargo handling capacity. With Duqm, it is now investing to make Oman 
the port of choice for vessels in need of repair or overhaul,” according to a 
report by OBG.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Master Plan of Duqm<br>
</b>A comprehensive master plan has been prepared for Duqm by the Supreme 
Committee for Town Planning, Sultanate of Oman. The area will have a major dry 
dock, commercial port and a shipbuilding yard in future. The master plan has 
designated areas for airport, petroleum refinery and oil storage facilities 
along with downstream industries, a fishing harbour with fishery related 
industries, free trade zones, general industries and tourism projects. It has 
planned a complete residential town with a Town Centre and all modern amenities.
<br>
<br>
A tentative allocation of 1,026 hectares has been made and designated as the 
Free Trade Zone. However, the total area in five different locations within the 
Duqm development area available both for FTZ and general industries is about 
21,000 hectares. Out of this, about 3,300 hectares has been designated for the 
study of setting Duqm refinery and petrochemical complex, and about 1,300 
hectares for fishery related industries. The commercial and dry dock facility 
would come up on 237 hectares. While the main port area would come up on a site 
of 115.6 hectares, ship repair facility would have 102-hectare area. It also 
will have about 13.4 hectares for workers and shipping clients to stay and rest. 
Exploring opportunities in tourism is one of the main components in the master 
plan, which includes hotels, resorts and a public beach.<br>
<br>
<b>Port &amp; dry dock facility<br>
</b>Duqm port is to be established to serve domestic trade, tourism and the 
fishing industry. Phase I provides for the harbour basin to be dredged to a 
depth of 10 metres and for the construction of 450 metres of jetties and a dry 
dock for ship repairs and maintenance. The port will be able to receive ships of 
up to 100,000 tonnes. Covering an area of 1.163 million square metres, the 
facility will comprise two dry docks as well as a floating dock equipped to 
repair and maintain oil and gas tankers of 100,000-tonne capacity. The port will 
have a total length of 2,800m for mooring and berthing of 8–10 vessels. It will 
simultaneously have berthing facilities for up to 16 vessels of small and medium 
size.<br>
<br>
The complex will have two dry docks to repair VLCC/LNG carriers, six different 
length size quays for berthing and mooring of up to 16 vessels simultaneously, 
heavy zones for carrying heavy materials with 150-tonne mobile crane and heavy 
structure handling up to 10,000 MT, unloading &amp; stocking material for unloading 
and stocking of major material, steel plates, copper slag (Nix), Hull processing 
shop, a work shop with newest processing and machining equipment, electric motor 
shop for repairing LNG carrier, other utilities like oxygen, acetylene, CO2 and 
compressed air plant, and a power distribution centre for nine sub stations. As 
part of environment friendly measures, there will be chemical oil treatment 
plant, Nix recycling plant, sewage treatment plant, incinerator plant and fresh 
water pump station. The welfare facilities include worker’s dormitory, guest 
house, sports centre, restaurant and playground. Dry dock and the commercial 
port are expected to be operational by 2010.<br>
<br>
An agreement worth RO2.15 million was signed on June 26, 2005, between the 
Government of Oman and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding and Maritime 
Engineering Company for provision of consultancy services and preparation of 
engineering designs leading to the construction of the dry dock facility.<br>
<br>
Having the reputation of being the world’s second largest shipbuilder, Daewoo 
has been awarded the contract for the design of two dry dock facilities and a 
floating dock facility, in addition to providing consultancy services for 
machinery. In late September, Oman awarded the contract to oversee the 
construction of the facility to Daewoo in a separate agreement. As part of the 
agreement, Daewoo will also manage and operate the repair docks for a 10-year 
period after its completion, on behalf of a newly formed state enterprise, the 
Oman Dry Dock Company. At the time the contract was signed, Ahmed bin Abdul Nabi 
Macki, Oman’s minister of finance and national economy, said the dry dock 
facility was one of the major strategic initiatives being undertaken by the 
government to develop new sources of revenue and employment for the country and 
diversify the economy. While the initial focus of the yard is repair and 
maintenance work, shipbuilding has not been ruled out.<br>
<br>
In April 2007, an Omani-Turkish consortium was awarded a contract to develop the 
marine infrastructure for the new Duqm port complex at a cost of RO186.892 
million. Consolidated Contractors Company (Oman) and Sezai Turkes – Feyzi Akkaya 
Ltd (STFA) of Turkey will execute the project in joint venture with 
Belgian-based international dredging giant Jan De Nul Dredging Ltd. The contract 
covers the first phase development of the Duqm port. This phase, comprising the 
maritime works package, covers the construction of breakwaters and quay walls, 
dredging and reclamation works and two breakwaters of a length of around 5 
kilometres. A pair of quays will also be constructed – a 700-metre-long quay for 
container, general cargo and dry bulk vessels, and a 330-metre quay for 
government vessels. Berths for tug and pilot boats and other craft will be built 
as well.<br>
<br>
In addition, dredging will be carried out to provide for the entrance channel, 
harbour basin, construction pockets and turning circle, with deeper dredged 
pockets created at the berths and floating docks. The harbour basin will be 
dredged to a depth of -16 metres and the approach channel to -17 metres. Also, 
as part of the maritime works package, reclamation will be undertaken behind the 
breakwaters, quay walls and inshore areas. Allowance must also be made within 
the commercial quay for the potential future installation of electrically 
operated rail-mounted quayside cranes.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1">In the second phase of the Duqm project, landside and infrastructure facilities 
will be established under a separate contract, while a major ship repair 
facility will be constructed in the third phase. Construction of the ship repair 
yard and dry-dock will run concurrently with the Phase 1 development of the 
marine infrastructure.<br>
<br>
“The port of Duqm is being designed to serve a new industrial hub that is being 
developed in the region, part of the government’s drive to increase investment 
and employment opportunities across the country and spread the base of the 
economy away from the traditional centre around Muscat. One proposal currently 
being considered is a refining and petrochemical complex, with Oman 
Polypropylene having already completed a feasibility study for the project. 
There are already other repair yards in the region, notably those in Dubai and 
Bahrain. However, apart from being the most modern, the Duqm facility will also 
offer the advantage of being just outside the Gulf, meaning ship owners will not 
have to pay the substantial fees to enter those busy waters. Duqm will also be 
positioned to attract the wider Indian Ocean trade, an important consideration 
as shipping in the region increases,” says the report of Oxford Business Group.<br>
<br>
When operational around 2010, the Duqm dry dock will rival among the biggest in 
the region. It will provide direct employment to around 1,500 people on 
operation, and the workforce is projected to rise to 3,000 by 2018 if a proposed 
shipbuilding yard is added to the complex. Thousands of indirect jobs would also 
be created. Total investment in the ship repair yard is estimated at RO250 
million.<br>
<br>
According to government officials, the main advantages of having a port a Duqm – 
from a ship owner’s point of view – while compared to other ports in the 
vicinity is that Dubai and ASRY need about three days after-repair work in order 
to charge inert gas into cargo tanks and test the repaired parts. While Dubai is 
12 hours away from loading port, ASRY is a four-hour drive. Moreover, the ship 
owners have to spend 2.5 days of idle time in case their vessels are repaired in 
Dubai and ASRY. Singapore too has similar demerit in case of vessels discharged 
at Thailand. Duqm is, in that way, located at a better position. “Most 
importantly, Duqm will not have the problem of demand considering the maximum 
capacity of regional competitors. The amount of excess demand in the Middle East 
region in 2007 is estimated at 154 vessels,” says an official.<br>
<br>
<b>Refinery &amp; petrochemical complex<br>
</b>Al Wusta region is distinguished for having a great number of oil wells. One 
of the possibilities could be setting up a space-oriented industry such as oil 
refinery and storage. Gradual shifting of one of the refinery and export 
functions from Mina Al Fahal to Duqm is another possible option before the 
government. The second option gains ground based on the fact that the only oil 
export terminal of Oman at Al Fahal port has certain disadvantages such as it is 
surrounded by populated area, offshore area is also busy for commercial shipping 
activities, oil fields are far away and oil is transported over the mountains, 
and environmental issues arise from refinery work and marine operations. If 
these factors are taken into consideration, the future expansion of the oil 
export at Mina Al Fahal does not look a possibility, and Duqm seems be the right 
alternative.<br>
<br>
Also, the government is in talks with international companies about investing in 
the proposed refining/petrochemicals complex at Duqm. The project cost is 
estimated at US$7 billion. The company will be owned by a new JV to be formed in 
partnership between the government and international investors. The refinery 
will have a capacity to process 300,000 barrels a day using Oman export blend, a 
light crude. The oil will be transported to the refinery complex through a new 
pipeline from the country’s northern fields. Diesel output from the refinery 
will be exported, while fuel oil will be sold in the local market, according to 
an official. The refinery will comprise the world’s largest polypropylene plant 
with a capacity of 1.2 million to 1.5 million tonne/year, a 2.8 million tonne/year 
aromatics plant and a 750,000 tonne/year styrene plant. Construction of this 
complex is due to start at the end of 2008 and will be completed in 2012. 
However, according to the Ministry of Oil &amp; Gas in Oman, everything is at a 
planning stage and nothing has been finalised yet.<br>
<br>
<b>Duqm airport</b><br>
A new modern, civil airport is envisaged in the Duqm master plan. The region 
airport will come up on a span of 2,720 hectares, and will meet the industrial 
needs of the area. It will also complement the port facilities in the town. The 
government has recently asked US engineering consultancy firm Parsons 
International to advise it on the design and construction of this airport. 
Parsons will also assist the government in preparing tender documents, cost 
estimation and selecting an EPC contractor for building the airport. The 
required investment and other details of the airport project will be known only 
after the consultancy agency conducted a detailed study and design the airport.<br>
<br>
<b>Power &amp; desalination project</b><br>
The master plan envisages a mega power station. The first phase of the project, 
with a capacity of 63MW, will be completed by 2011. The capacity will be scaled 
up to 200MW during the later phases. The power generation facility will be made 
up of a number of existing diesel-powered generation plants that are proposed to 
be dismantled and installed at Duqm from their present locations at Salalah and 
Sur. Salalah has five such diesel-powered plants, while Sur has four. These were 
made redundant by the arrival of natural gas-based power generation, which now 
meets much of the Sultanate’s electricity demand. Besides, there’s a separate 
project for the construction of a 6,000 cubic-metres-per-day-capacity reverse 
osmosis (RO) desalination plant. According to officials, 5.6 million gallons 
water shall be available by year 2011. The Rural Areas Electricity Company (REAC), 
a subsidiary of the state-owned Electricity Holding Company SAOC, is overseeing 
the development of these projects.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Tourism projects<br>
</b>A provision of 2,422 hectares has been made for tourism projects. 
Incidentally, three plots have already been taken up by the Oman Tourism 
Development Company (OTDC). KEO International Consultants has been selected to 
provide consultancy services for Duqm’s luxury hotel property. The project will 
be financed and managed by the Tourism Ministry’s investment arm, OTDC.<br>
<br>
The new hotel will be set on a 10-hectare plot located about seven kilometres 
from Duqm town, and not very far from the site of the Duqm Port &amp; Dry Dock 
complex planned at Ras Duqm. It will feature a 200-room hotel and 25 chalets, 
and will offer all the facilities and amenities of a modern international-class 
hotel. Business facilities, conference rooms, retail outlets and a mini golf 
course will add to the hotel’s appeal to visiting businessmen, consultants, 
contracting executives and investors. The property is expected to open for 
business in November 2008.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover8.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">With these kinds of mage projects in the pipeline, even the locals are upbeat. 
“The construction of Duqm will help in achieving a number of economic and 
tourism objectives and will be an added value to the services currently provided 
by Sultan Qaboos Port, Salalah Port and Sohar Port. The construction of the port 
will also create a considerable number of job opportunities for Omanis in 
general and Duqm locals in particular. It will also boost fish related industry, 
which is one of the major sources of GDP and the source of living for a 
considerable number of families in the region,” Sheikh Helal Bin Ali Al Habsi, 
Wali of Duqm, said.<br>
<br>
A number of health facilities and service utilities will be implemented at the 
wilayat to meet the growing demand for such services especially the area is 
expected to witness a remarkable boom in a number of industries. These utilities 
will provide valuable services for both locals and visitors, he furthered. <br>
<br>
Overall, Duqm will be first comprehensive planned town of the Sultanate of Oman. 
All the land use and activities are controlled and regulated. Location of 
industries and other land uses have been proposed keeping the natural 
environment in mind. The facilities that would be coming up in this city would 
be modern, sophisticated and up to date as far as the technology is concerned. 
Once completely operational, this town would be a force to reckon with in the 
entire Gulf region. No doubt, then it will be a destination for thousands of 
people, including the migrants.

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Residential town area</b>
<br>
There will be 17 residential quarters in place to accommodate a population of 
64,000 in a span of next
20 years. There is a provision for further expansion of the town comprising 
about 2,530 hectares to
111,000 residents. The first phase of the town will see an investment of RO110 
million. Each of these
17 quarters is a 1kmx800m rectangular block. Each quarter accommodates on an 
average about 4,750
residents. It will have an average of about more than 500 plots as parcel. More 
than 90 per cent of
these plots would be allotted for individual villas with three categories of 
housing. Only 10 per cent of
the plots are multi family housing with five storied apartments. All social and 
recreational facilities are
being designed within each of these quarters.<br>
<br>
About four quarters, along with local centres, should be available by 2011. The 
local centre shall contain the following facilities: Kindergarten, health centre (optional), a mosque, 
community recreational
centre, children’s play area, private school/training centre, post office 
(optional), shops and a petrol
filling station (optional). The town will also have three district centres. Main 
components of the district
centre will be grouped around a main square. Main attraction of the town would 
be the composite
Town Centre, which would act as the multipurpose central business centre of the 
city. The first phase
of the Town Centre, to come up on a spread of 172 hectares, will be ready by 
2011. It comprises retail
shops, restaurants, government and private offices, business centre, recreation 
facilities, cinema halls,
shopping malls, traditional souq, hotels, regional police headquarters, town 
mosque and regional and
the town bus terminals. There shall be adequate parking facilities for major 
land uses, including public
parking areas.
<br>
<br>
Apart from these, there will be a large Town Park over a 119-hectare area. It 
would have city’s sports
centre along with a large stadium. One private investor has shown interest in 
putting up a labour camp
and a residential accommodation for junior and mid level officials. An 
integrated large business centre
in the main Town Centre of Duqm is also planned with an estimated investment of 
RO300 million.
Though there is already a talk of booming real estate in the area, a 
Muscat based real estate agent
clarified that the government had banned all buying and selling of properties in 
the area as too much
speculation about the new mega projects might lead to price escalation. “We have 
this experience of
Sohar, where biggies bought the land and sold at higher prices. Probably to 
avoid this, the government
wants to keep the real estate prices in check. Moreover, the government itself 
wants to be part of overall
development of Duqm,” says the agent.</font></p>

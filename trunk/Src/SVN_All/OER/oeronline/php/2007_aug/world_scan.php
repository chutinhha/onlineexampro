rocks BBC</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
As per an agency report, BBC has suspended several staff members over a 
competition-rigging scandal, as police revealed they could investigate the 
controversy. The broadcaster admitted faking the winners of phone-ins and 
interactive competitions on six shows, including charity appeals Comic Relief, 
Sports Relief and Children in Need, as well as youngsters’ favourite Blue Peter. 
It suspended all such competitions temporarily amid embarrassing fallout. “We 
can confirm that a small number of staff have been asked to step aside from 
their duties whilst we review issues surrounding the incidents,” the broadcaster 
said in a statement. It is understood that those suspended are either executive 
producers or more senior figures.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

Nestle, Pepsi in merger 
talks<br>
<img border="0" src="world2.jpg" width="150" height="61" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">According to reports in the US media, 
Nestle and PepsiCo held merger talks in the spring that eventually collapsed 
over concerns about selling too much junk food as well as the structure. 
Reportedly, PepsiCo made an initial approach to Nestle. But Nestle was concerned 
that a deal with Pepsi would dilute its mission of selling more healthy food and 
beverages. There were also complications of structuring a deal. Pepsi, in 
addition to its colas, owns the Frito-Lay brand of potato chips. Nestle also 
sells products such as Scooby-Doo Mystery Pops and the KitKat chocolate bars. In 
another unrelated development, the US media was rife with rumours that PepsiCo 
Inc. is looking to expand its partnership with the coffee shop chain Starbucks 
Corp. PepsiCo currently distributes bottled Starbucks Frappuccino drinks to 
grocery stores and other retailers.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

track</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
As per a study by eMarketer, online video advertising is expected to boom by 
2011 when the lines between TV and Web video will be blurred. Video ad sales are 
expected to grow from an estimated US$775 million this year to US$3.1 billion in 
2010 and then to $4.3 billion in 2011. The advertisers will begin directing more 
of their marketing budgets to the online version. By 2011, online commercials 
will likely appear in multiple forms beyond today’s pre-roll ads, which users 
must sit through before watching a video clip. For example, some interactive 
banners will play an ad whenever a user clicks it or rolls the cursor over it. 
And graphics along the bottom or side of a video clip will encourage users to 
watch a commercial. It is also expected that more online video ads will offer 
rewards in exchange for the user’s time. Potential payoffs may include free 
content, games, coupons, or ways for users to personalise commercials. Companies 
are already experimenting with the new video ad formats. </font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

Branson, Khosla invest 
in biofuel firm<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Entrepreneurial luminaries Vinod Khosla 
and Richard Branson have made significant investments in a company that is 
working on the development and production of advanced biofuels. Khosla, managing 
partner of Khosla Ventures and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, and Branson, 
founder of Virgin Fuels and other components of a business empire organised 
under the Virgin brand, are giving their backing to Gevo Inc., a Pasadena-based 
company seeking to transform biomass into butanol fuel on an industrial scale. 
The retention of Khosla Ventures and Virgin Fuels will provide the small 
start-up firm with substantial financial and managerial backing. Branson has 
said that he hopes his fleet of commercial and private planes will one day run 
on biofuel. </font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">The seventh and final volume of Harry 
Potter has become the fastest-selling book in history, with 11 million copies 
sold in three markets within 24 hours. The eagerly awaited volume, Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hallows, flew off the shelves around the world. <br>
<br>
In the UK, Bloomsbury said it sold a record 2.7 million copies in the first 24 
hours, the final volume selling 700,000 more than Harry Potter and the 
Half-Blood Prince. In the US, meanwhile 8.3 million sales were recorded in the 
first day, almost 1.5 million more than the previous instalment. It said 400,000 
English language editions of the book sold in Germany in the same period.<br>
<br>
Harry Potter mania reached its peak as millions queued overnight to get their 
hands on an early copy of the book. JK Rowling, the author, has received almost 
exclusively rave reviews for her closely-guarded latest effort, after a 
relatively mixed reaction to her last six in the series, which sold 325 million 
worldwide. It is being released in 93 countries, with a print run of 12 million 
in the US and more than 2.2 million ordered in advance from the internet 
retailer Amazon. </font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

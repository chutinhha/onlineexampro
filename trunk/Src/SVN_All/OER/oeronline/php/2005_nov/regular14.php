period under review witnessed an eventless market with no specific happenings 
boosting the market sentiments. The market did not exhibit any major movement. 
The index made a change of just over 1 per cent. The services sector index 
showed some significant improvement at 2.68 per cent while the industry sector 
declined. The banking sector index also showed a marginal improvement of 1.92 
per cent. The market again breached a level below 5000 mark in the period under 
review and is hovering around the 5100 levels. The third quarter results 
expected for most of the corporates is to be with no appreciable income from 
fair value gains as predicted by Fincorp in the last issue of OER may come true 
and the market seems to have discounted the above information in advance. Again 
the onset of the holy month of Ramadan has made things even duller for the 
market with volumes not registering the previous levels experienced.</font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>MSM is very 
attractive compared to other GCC countries:</b><br>
We have done an analysis of the various GCC markets and identified the 
corrections underwent by them in Apr-June 2005 and the current market Index. The 
results are very interesting and summarized as under:<br>
<br>
We find that all the GCC markets underwent a correction during the Apr-June 2005 
period , and rebounded after that. All the GCC markets, except Abudhabi and Oman 
have crossed their previous peak achieved in Apr-June 2005 period or coming very 
close to that. Oman is lagging behind at present. This presents a potential 
opportunity for all GCC investors considering the kind of valuations all these 
markets enjoy. Please refer the following table giving the valuations:<br>
<br>
We find that Oman markets are very attractive based on the valuations next to 
Bahrain. The macro economic parameters are also very strong in Oman. Considering 
all this, the anomaly between Oman and other GCC markets should be corrected 
very soon.<br>
<br>
<b>Omantel</b><br>
Omantel counter will be opened for entry to the regional investors as well as to 
the domestic funds/ companies / institutions from the 27th of October 2005. As 
against the projected net profit of RO 75 mn for the year 2005, omantel has 
achieved a net profit of RO 39.1 mn for the half year 2005. It makes an 
interersting reading to know how the telecom company shares are quoting in the 
GCC markets for us to predict (rightly or erroneously) the range within which 
Omantel shares may quote. The following table will be helpful to decipher the 
intrinsic strength of omantel shares upon its opening to the regional investors 
/ domestic institutions and companies.<br>
<br>
It can be seen that out of the 5 markets, telecom shares are quoting at a 
discount to their respective market PEs namely in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE 
whereas in the remaining 2 markets, the telecom shares are quoting at a premium 
namely in Kuwait and Bahrain. <br>
<br>
Oman automatically falls under the latter group category and it can be safely 
asumed that Omantel will be quoting at a premium to that of MSM market. But the 
question remains to what extent. <br>
<br>
Going by the yardstick available, Omantel shares can have a premium element of 
30% to 35% to that of the market. Again assuming that the market will have a P/E 
of 19 at the time of entry of these investors, it brings us to a price range of 
RO 2.5 to 2.6. However on the book value count, the stock has very good 
potential to appreciate even further. Investors are accordingly advised to 
position themselves in the market for optimizing returns from Omantel shares 
counter.<br>
<br>
<b>Outlook</b><br>
The oil prices have come down in the international market and oscillating 
currently at 60$ level. The future of the GCC markets including MSM will be 
greatly influenced by the movement in oil prices. The 3rd quarter results are 
also awaited in the current month. Hence the oil prices along with the 3rd 
quarter results will decide the direction of the future trend.</font></p>

                    According to Sultan Al Habsi, Executive President, PEIE: 
                    “China’s emerging as a major economic power, and plays an 
                    important role in the global supply chains of many 
                    industries. For example, it serves as a key supply source, 
                    centre of technological innovation, increasing design and 
                    manufacturing base and an emerging consumer market.” Indeed, 
                    many experts expect China’s entry into the World Trade 
                    Organization will create even greater opportunities. <br>
                    <br>
                    Yet, operating a supply chain with China being a key part of 
                    it, can be challenging. Besides the cultural and 
                    organizational differences, Omani companies interested in 
                    exploring and penetrating China will have to learn the local 
                    strengths and limitations of business relationships, 
                    consumer preferences, logistics infrastructures, channel 
                    structures, information systems and technological trends of 
                    the country. <br>

                    at the Smart Manufacturing conference, PEIE-based 
                    manufacturers want to understand how to capitalize on

                    Arcus Amouage, the first product in an exciting new men’s 
                    fragrance line unveiled by the house of Amouage is a 
                    compelling and enthralling perfume. This truly invigorating 
                    fragrance from the citrus marine family, took some of 
                    greatest master parfumiers in Paris almost two years to 
                    ‘compose’. A vibrant symphony of the scents of precious 
                    woods, leaves and flowers - Arcus leaves a lingering feeling 
                    of freshness and zest throughout the day. Arcus Amouage is 
                    available in 75ml, and is being launched for the first time, 
                    simultaneously across the entire Middle East (including Duty 
                    Frees and airlines), Europe, Russia, and on its website

                    <b>BMW Group sales increase by 11.4% </b><br>
                    The BMW Group continues its successful course worldwide in 
                    September 2005. With 131,705 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce 
                    automobiles supplied, sales rose by 11.4% over the same 
                    month last year. For the period up to and including 
                    September, i.e. to the end of the third quarter, 988,463 
                    vehicles have already been supplied to customers, which is 
                    an increase of over 100,000 cars, or 11.4%, compared with 
                    the relevant period last year. <br>
                    <br>
                    For the BMW brand, sales rose in September by 13.5% to 
                    111,518 automobiles. Up to and including September, BMW 
                    dealers delivered 11.4% more automobiles. The BMW 1 Series 
                    has now been on the market for a full year. From its start 
                    on 18 September 2004 to the end of September 2005, the 
                    company has already sold over 150,000 BMW 1 Series. In the 
                    current year, the figure is 114,188. This means that this 
                    car has become a permanent fixture in the compact class in 
                    just a short time – partly, and particularly, because of its 
                    totally unique concept. The new BMW 3 Series saloon, which 
                    has been available since March this year, also reached the 
                    150,000 sales mark at the end of September. <br>
                    <br>
                    While on BMW, two groundbreaking safety innovations are now 
                    available from the luxury vehicle giant – Night Vision and 
                    High-Beam Assistant. These options will be available on 
                    selected models throughout the Middle East after October.<br>
                    <br>
                    Night Vision, that enables early detection of far-off people 
                    and animals in the dark, will be introduced on the BMW 7 
                    Series next month and extended to the 5 Series and 6 Series 
                    early next year.</font></p>

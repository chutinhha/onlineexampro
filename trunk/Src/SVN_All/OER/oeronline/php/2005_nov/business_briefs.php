                    their business in the Middle East region. The conference

                    buyers’ risk. It has been prepared by the ECGA’s General 
                    Manager, Nasir bin Issa Al-Ismaily. He has identified major 
                    areas of credit information reports and elements involved in 
                    assessing credit risks while considering credit limit for 
                    buyers by the exporters.<br>

                    The Bulletin also includes country profile of buyers of 
                    insured Omani exports focusing on Jordan where the level of 
                    Omani exports to that country has significantly increased 
                    and reached to RO.26.2m in 2004 compared to imports at 
                    RO.3.01m. <br>

                    <br>
                    </b>The Criminal Court in Muscat has convicted 31 people, 
                    including both Omanis and expatriates, who were charged with 
                    corruption in a court case known as the “electricity fraud 
                    case.” The court awarded the 31 people various prison terms 
                    and fines. The trial had started in June this year. <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the suspects, the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of 
                    Housing, Electricity and Water, was slapped a prison term of 
                    17 years, and ordered to pay RO70,000 as fines, besides 
                    being expelled from his job. Among those convicted is a 
                    former ambassador of the Sultanate to the United Kingdom. 
                    The suspects faced charges of forgery, bribery, divulging 
                    professional secrets and misuse of office. <br>
                    <br>
                    Before the hearing started, the general manager of the Oman 
                    National Electricity Company, an Indian, fled the country. 
                    This led the court to arrest all the suspects and confiscate 
                    their passports. <br>
                    <br>
                    The verdict was issued by Muscat Criminal Court, headed by 
                    the court chairman Shaikh Mahmood al Rashdi.</font></p>

                    <img border="1" src="pwc.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="89" hspace="5" vspace="2"></b>PWC 
                    Logistics Oman has signed a lease agreement with the Public 
                    Establishment for Industrial Estates (PEIE) in Sohar and 
                    will sign a second lease agreement with PEIE’s industrial 
                    estate in Salalah at the back end of the year. <br>
                    <br>
                    Commenting on 
                    their move to Sohar Industrial Estate, Chris Clark, PWC 
                    Logistics’ Country Manager remarked: “the reason we leased 
                    PEIE land in Sohar is five fold - the location for a 
                    logistics company is excellent, we’re 6 kilometers from 
                    Sohar Industrial Port, 200 kilometers from Dubai and 250 
                    kilometers from Muscat – the positioning couldn’t be more 
                    strategic. <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to be able to handle our fast moving 
                    consumer goods business in the area, we needed land that was 
                    accessible to the local area and free of port restrictions. 
                    In this regard, PEIE’s Sohar Industrial Estate fitted the 
                    bill. The length of the lease - 25 years, with options for 
                    extension - gives PWC the security that its significant 
                    investment in warehousing and systems technology wouldn’t be 
                    compromised. It makes commercial sense for PWC to invest its 
                    money in areas that will offer solid returns for the 
                    business. Moreover, it was important for PWC to have 
                    industries nearby that may one day may be potential 
                    customers.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Commenting on the PWC Logistic decision, Sultan Al Habsi, 
                    Executive President, PEIE, said: “Welcoming PWC Logistics to 
                    Sohar Industrial Estate is excellent news. They’re a highly 
                    reputable company with the capability to help other local 
                    companies which adds substantial value to this investment 
                    and clearly demonstrates the aim of PEIE to attract quality 
                    companies and encourage entrepreneurs.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Reinforcing Al Habsi’s enthusiasm, Mohammed Al Ghassani, 
                    Executive Vice President, PEIE pointed to the Government’s 
                    strong support for manufacturing and ICT as delivered 
                    through the PEIE network. Al Ghassani emphasized that “we 
                    should be in no doubt that the success of Oman’s 
                    manufacturers and ICT firms is crucial to achieving 
                    prosperity for all. <br>
                    <br>
                    Make no mistake, there are some exceptionally good 
                    management teams on PEIE estates, doing successful business 
                    in areas of manufacturing and ICT. Indeed, PWC Logistics 
                    falls firmly into that category. I’m delighted that they’ve 
                    decided to set-up operations with us in Sohar.”</font></p>

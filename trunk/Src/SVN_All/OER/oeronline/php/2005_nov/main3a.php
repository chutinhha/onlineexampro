World Summit on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, in an unprecedented effort, is 
gathering the best minds of economic development, innovation and 
entrepreneurship to come together on April 1 – 3, 2006, in Muscat. These 
masterminds are assembling for a landmark event in networking, establishing 
thought leadership, and exploring ways to meet the new challenges confronting 
global economies. The motto is to form all-important relationships, with the 
conviction that common prosperity is achieved through broader participation and 
closer cooperation among all developing and developed markets alike. <br>
<br>
In order to create and expand the prosperity of developing countries, it is 
essential that the climate and enablers for innovation and entrepreneurship be 
shaped and enhanced, something of critical relevance to all organizations and 
individuals—who are committed to improve the quality of living for future 
generations.<br>
<br>
Yet, no one person, organization or country can take on the breadth and depth of 
actions necessary to advance this Noble cause. It will take the cooperative 
know-how, skills, resources and energy of all working in concert to achieve such 
articulated goals.<br>
<br>
Inspired by a vision of global peace and common prosperity, the World Summit on 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship is determined to create a more dynamic and 
prosperous world in the new century through three days of roundtables, plenary 
sessions, networking meetings, interactive workshops, and thematic banquets -- 
all expressing the Summit theme: “A Better Generation in the Making.”<br>
<br>
Together with over 80 global leaders -- from academics, government, business, 
media, civil society and non-profit organizations -- the World Summit on 
Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship will present the opportunity to:<br>
<br>
• Share case studies that showcase the importance of secure culture, advanced 
R&amp;D institutions, and transparent legal infrastructure for the design and 
manufacturing of advanced electronic products. <br>
• Identify growth opportunities in Mobile &amp; 3G, broadband, telecom equipment, 
contact and service centers in emerging markets of Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle 
East, Latin America and Africa.<br>
• Establish partnerships with thriving clusters that enjoy strong government 
support, access to talent, and commitment to biotechnology, to keep you at the 
forefront of the bioscience movement. <br>
• Develop a collaborative strategy between governments, universities and 
organizations to exploit advanced manufacturing, and next generation 
Nanotechnology as a tangible example of the knowledge economy in action. <br>
• Apply the secrets of the World’s great financial centers, to improve the 
breadth, depth of your organizational capabilities, dynamism and innovation. <br>
• Create the necessary conditions to attract private investment to the 
environmental sector, specifically solar, wind generation, and powered 
generation.<br>
<br>
Having chosen the Sultanate of Oman as the ultimate venue, due to its 
progressive governance, sustainable practices, and its strategic proximity 
between the East and West, this landmark event will play a vital role in 
inspiring the developed and developing nations to come together, to appreciate 
the world’s greatest innovations, and to create opportunities for future 
generations. <br>
<br>
The World Summit on Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship is a must-attend event for all 
global decision makers. It is the only global Forum of its kind, taking a look 
at innovation and entrepreneurship for the maximum benefit of all emerging 
populations—from Asia, to Africa, to the Americas, to Europe, to the Arab World, 
and to the Host Government that inspired it all— Oman. <br>

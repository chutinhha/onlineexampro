            Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has warned the Kremlin against move to 
            bury the embalmed body of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, denouncing 
            such intention as “irresponsible and provocative.”<br>
            <br>
            In what appeared to be the Kremlin’s attempt to gauge public 
            reaction to the divisive issue, Georgy Poltavchenko, a regional 
            envoy of President Vladimir Putin, said recently that Lenin’s body 
            should be buried in a cemetery along with the remains of other 
            Bolshevik dignitaries.<br>
            <br>
            Several senior lawmakers in the Kremlin-controlled parliament 
            followed up on his call, proposing to quickly bury Lenin’s body, 
            which lies in state in a red marble mausoleum on Red Square. Deputy 
            parliament speaker Lyubob Sliska said Lenin’s body could be laid to 
            rest as early as January.<br>
            <br>
            Zyuganov said in a statement posted on his party’s web site that the 
            call for Lenin’s burial clearly had the Kremlin’s blessing, and 
            denounced it as “sacrilegious, ... irresponsible and provocative.”</font></p>

            <br>
            </b>Britons are the most prolific shoplifters in Europe, according 
            to a survey published recently.<br>
            <br>
            They stole £3.58 billion of goods from their nation’s shops last 
            year, the equivalent of 1.59 per cent of British retail turnover.<br>
            <br>
            Razor blades were the most stolen item followed by alcohol and 
            toiletries, according to the British-based Centre for Retail 
            Research.<br>
            <br>
            Finland had the second worst shoplifting problem followed by 
            Portugal and Greece while the Swiss were the most disciplined 
            shoppers, the survey showed. Theft accounted for 0.89 per cent of 
            Swiss retail turnover.<br>
            <br>
            In all, Europeans stole Euros 30.8 billion worth of goods from their 
            stores last year – Euros 71.5 per person.<br>
            <br>
            Customers were blamed for 48 per cent of the thefts, staff for 29 
            per cent and suppliers for 7 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            The survey covered 423 retailers in 24 countries, accounting for 20 
            perc ent of European retail turnover. </font></p>

            </b><br>
            As toddlers begin eating food meant for the grown-up, they may also 
            develop grown-up eating habits like too much junk food and too few 
            vegetables, warn doctors who want parents to mend their ways.<br>
            <br>
            Childhood obesity is a stark reality now with an increasing number 
            of overweight two-year-olds, according to paediatrics experts. In an 
            effort to address the problem, the American Heart Association is 
            offering this advice to parents: Children aged two and over should 
            eat mostly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat and non-fat 
            dairy products, beans, fish and lean meat.<br>
            <br>
            “These guidelines are not very different from what you as a parent 
            should be following,” says Lona Sandon, a dietician and assistant 
            professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in 
            Dallas. “Kids will follow the example of their parents if the 
            example is there.”<br>
            <br>
            The new recommendations for infants, children and adolescents revise 
            the heart association’s 1982 statement. Since then, more and more 
            children have been falling into the overweight or obese category. 
            The updated guidelines, which are endorsed by the American Academy 
            of Pediatrics, also recommend that children aged two and above 
            should get an hour of exercise a day.<br>
            <br>
            Dr Barbara Dennison, who helped draw up the guidelines and is 
            associate professor of clinical paediatrics at Columbia University, 
            says that 10 per cent of the two-year-olds are overweight, double 
            the rate from the mid-1970s.<br>
            <br>
            “The whole idea of a nutritionally balanced diet has been 
            compromised,” says Dr. Samuel S Gidding, another adviser on the AHA 
            recommendations and professor of paediatric cardiology at Jefferson 
            Medical College in Philadelphia. “I think that fast foods have 
            become — rather than being discretionary choices — the main stop for 
            meals.” He says that 30 to 50 years ago, food that was nutritional 
            was considered “food for kids.” Now, he says, food items for kids 
            are viewed as sweets, snacks or so-called comfort foods.<br>
            <br>
            The heart association notes that by the time kids are 19 to 24 
            months, French Fries are the most commonly eaten vegetable. Experts 
            say that as jars of baby food packed with fruits and vegetables give 
            way to solid foods, nutritious food is often bypassed for whatever 
            is the easiest.<br>
            The heart association guidelines urge parents not to give up if 
            their kids at first reject healthy food. Experts say it can take up 
            to 10 attempts for a child to accept a new food.</font></p>

            competition easing in China: Honda<br>
            <br>
            </b>Honda Motor, Japan’s third biggest automaker, expects price 
            competition in China to ease while sales steadily increase in the 
            next five years, a company executive said today. Atsuyoshi Hyogo, 
            chief operating officer for Honda’s China operations, said stock 
            adjustments were going ahead, and some automakers had already begun 
            to raise product prices. <br>
            <br>
            Honda in April projected a drop in net profit this year citing stiff 
            price competition in China. On Thursday, it lifted its profit 
            forecast to a slight rise, but said smaller earnings in China hurt 
            in the first half of the year. <br>
            <br>
            “Price pressure does exist, but car makers have also begun adjusting 
            their inventories and that is easing the pressure,” Hyogo, also 
            chairman and president of Honda Motor (China) Investment, told 
            reporters at Honda’s headquarters in Tokyo. <br>
            <br>
            He said he expected total sales in the Chinese auto market, 
            including truck and other commercial vehicles, to reach as much as 
            5.6 million units this year, adding the market would likely grow 10 
            to 15% annually until at least 2010. <br>
            <br>
            Hyogo noted demand in China was shifting to smaller, cheaper 
            vehicles.</font></p>

            disease, diabetes and other chronic ailments will kill nearly 400 
            million people over the next 10 years, but many of those deaths can 
            be prevented by healthier lifestyles and inexpensive medication, the 
            World Health Organization said recently.<br>
            <br>
            The financial burden from an increasing toll from such 
            non-communicable diseases will also be enormous, costing countries 
            such as China and India billions of dollars, WHO said in a report.<br>
            <br>
            “The lives of far too many people in the world are being blighted 
            and cut short by chronic diseases,” said Lee Jong-Woo, WHO, 
            Director-General. He was citing the latest WHO report to draw 
            attention to the increasing threat from diseases that can be 
            prevented in part by healthier diets and giving up smoking.<br>
            <br>
            Till recently, these chronic conditions were overshadowed by 
            infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, though they cause far more 
            deaths. Chronic, or non-communicable diseases, account for three out 
            of five deaths worldwide. The 128-page WHO report estimated that 39 
            million deaths (including 28 million in developing countries) from 
            chronic diseases in the next 10 years could be prevented by 
            promoting healthier lifestyles and relatively cheap medication.</font></p>

            against a monopoly <br>
            </b><br>
            Internet search king Google and US tech giant Sun Microsystems said 
            they were teaming up to offer free spreadsheet and word-processing 
            software online in a head-on challenge to rival Microsoft.<br>
            <br>
            The two companies announced a deal under which they will allow all 
            web users to access Sun’s OpenOffice -- its equivalent to the 
            dominant Microsoft Office program -- from any personal computer.<br>
            <br>
            “Working with Google will make our technologies available more 
            broadly, increase options for users, lower barriers and expand 
            participation worldwide,” said Sun’s chief executive Scott McNealy 
            in a statement.<br>
            <br>
            “Free and open-source technologies, such as OpenOffice.org, 
            OpenSolaris and Java, have never been safer or offered more 
            choices,” he added, unveiling the nascent partnership with the 
            planet’s most popular search engine.<br>
            <br>
            The accord gives Google, which is moving aggressively beyond its 
            search-engine origins, the right to develop Sun products.<br>
            <br>
            Sun will offer Google’s search toolbar with downloads of its free 
            Java software, a utility for an array of web-based applications that 
            Sun says powers more than 2.5 billion gadgets, including 700 million 
            PCs.<br>
            “Google and Java are two of the most widely recognized technology 
            brands because they provide users with online tools that enhance 
            their lives on a day-to-day basis,” said Google chief executive Eric 
            Schmidt.<br>
            <br>
            The move to make OpenOffice available online throws down the 
            gauntlet to Microsoft, a long-standing rival to Sun and the global 
            market leader in software applications.<br>
            <br>
            Google’s distribution of the Sun software could undercut Microsoft’s 
            bedrock business strategy of selling its ubiquitous software bundled 
            into operating systems that come pre-installed on PCs. For Google, 
            the Sun partnership could help in its battle with Microsoft and 
            rival search engine Yahoo over the delivery of web-based services.<br>
            <br>
            For years, Sun and others have tried without success to dent 
            Microsoft’s dominance of the market for business software that 
            combines word processing, spreadsheet, e-mail and other programs.<br>
            <br>
            The companies could not say when Google will begin carrying Sun’s 
            technology, including OpenOffice, which was launched in 2000.</font></p>

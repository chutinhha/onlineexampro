<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Please tell OER about your 
entry into the stock brokerage world in Oman.</b><br>
MSM was established by the Royal Decree (53/88) issued in June 1988. <br>
It started functioning on May 20, 1989. One month later we launched Al Ahlia 
Portfolio &amp; Securities, which was the first Omani brokerage SAOC company. Later 
on it became an SAOG company. <br>
<br>
In 1994, I applied for the license for Al Amin Securities LLC. There were six 
other brokerage firms in Oman and we were the seventh to set up business. <br>
<br>
<b>What are your comments on performance of MSM?</b><br>
After the initial hiccups, MSM started on a slow yet steady upswing. As the 
market grew stronger, more buyers and sellers came forth to trade in the stocks. 
We also attracted traders from other Arab countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia 
and Qatar. <br>
<br>
In fact, in the year 1997, Oman’s market was the best performer among those 
emerging in the Gulf. But MSM’s downslide started from 1998 and continued until 
last year. In between, it did pick up, but not much. <br>
<br>
However, there has been a marked improvement in the markets since last year and 
the trend is continuing even now. We hope it gets better and we are positive 
that it will. <br>
<br>
<b>How erudite are the people about trading in Oman?</b><br>
The situation has improved a lot now in Oman. People are much better informed 
about the stock markets than they were before. Initially, there were not many 
interested in stocks and trading. One of the reasons for this was the poor 
performance of MSM. <br>
<br>
But things have changed since last year, with the improvement in the stock 
markets. More people are interested in trading these days. There are many who 
come in for advice and ask a lot of questions before investing. <br>
<br>
<b>What is your opinion about Omantel’s IPO, which created a lot of excitement?</b><br>
The Omantel IPO has created an excitement like we have not witnessed before. 
It’s been a great success and we hope that other companies follow suit. Omantel 
has become a shining example for others and have actually changed the investment 
scenario in Oman.<br>
<br>
<b>How do you perceive the investment climate in Oman?</b><br>
Investment opportunities are rising in Oman, which is a good sign for the 
country and its economic stability. We have a rich economy and with some extra 
work we can improve the markets. <br>
<br>
New markets for investment, like tourism, are opening up in Oman and this is 
sure to boost the economy. What is needed is better education for people about 
investment and stocks. A few changes in regulations with regard to trading, 
market and investment could bring in more interested parties. </font></p>

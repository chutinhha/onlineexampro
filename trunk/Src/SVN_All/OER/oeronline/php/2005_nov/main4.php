become a runaway commercial success – a bold initiative that promises to anchor 
Oman’s future economic prosperity. While it is shaping up as an industrial hub 
of Oman, many are looking at the corridor between Sohar and Dubai. It promises 
to become a major regional hub as well. OER reports…</font></b></p>

was an unremarkable seafront stretch barely three years ago is today one of the 
most sought after destinations in the Gulf region for investment in 
petrochemical and mega-industrial ventures. <br>
<br>
Indeed, Sohar Industrial Port has already broken all records as the fastest 
growing industrial hub in the region – a distinction underlined by the fact that 
none of the tenanted ventures have yet commenced operation. The pace of 
transformation from a greenfield project to a world-class industrial port in the 
making, is truly breathtaking. <br>
<br>
Says Malak Ahmed Al-Shaibani, manager Corporate Affairs, Sohar Aluminium: “The 
main locational advantages for our company’s base in Sohar are the existence of 
infrastructure facilities such as the industrial port and also the availability 
of energy at competitive prices. Oman also has a favourable location at the 
cross roads of the major trading routes between the East and the West. What is 
also more important is there is a large pool of Omani people in Sohar whom we 
can train to work in the Smelter.” <br>
<br>
Sohar Aluminium is one of the biggest industrial establishments in Sohar. Its 
targeted revenues, based on projections, is around RO200 million.<br>
<br>
Adds Malak: “Globally, the demand for aluminum will create significant new 
capacity over the next ten years. The Gulf region will become an attraction for 
this industry due to the existence of competitive energy. The management and 
shareholders of Sohar Aluminium are committed to making this project a milestone 
in Oman’s history by creating downstream industries that will create more 
employment benefits for Omanis and also for Omani businesses. Historically, a 
lot of communities in Europe and other parts of the world have developed around 
smelters. These smelters have employed people, contributed to creation of 
downstream industries, technology transfer and trade opportunities. Sohar 
Aluminium will be the impetus for the creation of future opportunities for Sohar 
and Oman in general.”<br>
<br>
Dr. Hamed Al Dhahab, Deputy CEO, Oman Polypropylene LLC, says the development of 
Sohar is in keeping with the Sultanate’s 2020 Vision, which aims at cutting the 
dependence of the Sultanate’s economy on the depleting source, the oil. “To 
achieve that, the Government developed two areas for large gas-based industries, 
Sur and Sohar. The investment in these two areas surpasses our expectations. All 
institutional and physical infrastructures are at place now. The participation 
of foreign investment is in full steam.”<br>
<br>
In fact, Sohar’s astounding success, so early on in its development, has even 
caught government planners and industry pundits by surprise. Almost every 
available plot within the massive 2,000-hectare heavy industrial zone has been 
committed to investors. And with investor interest in the port hardly ebbing, 
authorities are already drawing up plans to more than double the size of the 
industrial zone, as well as significantly expand the port infrastructure and 
superstructure. <br>
<br>
Sohar’s robust appeal stems from a number of factors: its strategic location 
just outside the Arabian Gulf, proximity to international sea lanes, cheap 
natural gas, stable political environment, and modern outlook. Underscoring this 
appeal is the presence of a number of highly rated service providers.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="soharp1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="250" height="133">Already, 
petrochemical and industrial ventures involving a total investment of around $8 
billion are under various stages of development at Sohar. Many of these schemes 
form the core elements of industrial clusters that will spawn downstream 
manufacturing and processing opportunities in plastics, petrochemicals and 
metals. The upshot is a mammoth enterprise that promises to create economic 
wealth, job opportunities and new revenue streams.<br>
<br>
Some of the key projects established include:<br>
• Oil refining – Investments by the Government of Oman (80%) and Oman Oil 
Company (20%) amounting to $1 billion <br>
• Petrochemicals – Investments made by the Oman Oil Company (50%) and Dow 
Chemical Company (50%) amounting to $1 billion<br>
• Aluminium – Investments by Alcan (20%), the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity 
Authority (40%) and OOC (40%) amounting to $2.2 billion<br>
• Polypropylene – Investments by Oman Oil Company (60%), LG International (20%) 
and Gulf Investment Corporation (20%) amounting to $313 million<br>
• Aromatics – Investments by Oman Oil Company (60%), Oman Refinery Company (20%) 
and LG International Corporation (20%), amounting to $1.1 billion<br>
• Methanol – Investments by Oman Methanol Holding (30%), MAN Ferrostaal Methanol 
International Limited (20%) and Methanol Holding International Limited (50%) 
amounting to $500 million.<br>
• Ethylene dichloride – Investments by Oman Oil Company, LG International and 
National Petroleum Company of Iran, amounting to $300 million.<br>
• Steel mill – investments by Al Ghaith Holding amounting to $750 million<br>
Located on the Batinah coast of Oman, the port and industrial zone is being 
developed by the Sohar Industrial Port Company (SIPC), a 50:50 joint venture 
between the Government of Oman and the Port of Rotterdam. SIPC’s role is to 
promote, co-ordinate and facilitate the requirements of the major heavy 
industries proposing to establish their plants in the industrial estate.<br>
<br>
The 2,000-hectare industrial zone is itself a hive of frenetic activity with 
thousands of workers, backed by an array of heavy construction equipment, busy 
putting in place the infrastructure for one of the world’s biggest green-field 
petrochemical and metal-based industrial hubs. Several new projects are on the 
anvil, including a proposed steel billeting plant and a special economic zone (EEZ).</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">These investments are expected 
to generate roughly 6,000 direct jobs within the Sohar port and industrial 
complex, while creating employment for a further estimated 24,000 people engaged 
in the provision of support facilities and services to the Sohar complex. The 
consequent socio-economic benefits to the Batinah region, and indeed the wider 
economy, are indeed enormous.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="soharp3.jpg" width="300" height="216"></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Construction work is at full 
tilt at various sites across the vast complex. An army of several thousand 
workers, engaged by a legion of contractors, is currently at work on their 
respective sites. In the coming months, worker strengths will swell to some 
12,000-15,000 as construction gets underway on a slew of planned projects, 
rising to some 25,000 when construction activity peaks.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="soharp4.jpg" width="350" height="269"></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Rapidly taking shape on the 
horizon is the refinery complex of Sohar Refinery Company (SRC) – the 
centrepiece of a petrochemicals cluster envisioned at Sohar. The $1 billion 
project, being constructed by JGC of Japan, features a Crude Unit with a 
capacity of 116,400 barrels per day (bpd) and a Residue Fluid Catalytic Cracking 
Unit (RFCCU) with a capacity of 75,260 bpd. <br>
<br>
Development of SRC is closely linked to Oman Refinery Company (ORC), which owns 
the feedstock and the refined products processed at SRC. Feedstock will be 
delivered to SRC by ORC via a pipeline from the latter’s existing refinery at 
Mina Al Fahal.<br>
<br>
The new Sohar refinery will operate in a 'maximum olefin mode' to maximise 
propylene production of around 327,000 metric tonnes per day. Initially, about 
10 per cent of the refined products will be sold in the local market with the 
remainder available for further value addition and export.<br>
<br>
Civil works are also well underway on Oman Polypropylene Company’s (OPP) 
340,000-tonne-capacity polypropylene plant, which is integrated with the 
refinery. The $313 million project will add value to Sohar Refinery’s propylene 
stream to produce polypropylene that can be used in an array of downstream 
industries.<br>
<br>
Opportunities abound in the manufacture of by-products of polypropylene pellets 
such as fibres, filaments, woven tapes, injection moulding, thermoforming, blow 
moulded containers, transparent household and storage containers and other 
packaging items. In fact, polypropylene has application in a staggering range of 
products of daily use: such as food packaging, flower wrapping, furniture, and 
bottles, just to name a few.<br>
<br>
While the Government of Oman is playing a lead role in the development of the 
large majority of projects at Sohar, the private sector is proving no laggard 
itself on the investment front. Construction will shortly pick up gear on the 
$650 million ammonia and urea project of Sohar International Urea &amp; Chemical 
Industries (SIUCI). Promoted by well-known Omani businessman Shaikh Suhail 
Bahwan, the Sohar fertiliser project will have a production capacity of 1.225 
million tonnes per annum of granular urea. The project is one of the largest 
private sector greenfield fertiliser projects in the world and the largest 
industrial investment by an individual in the GCC. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 
of Japan will execute the project on an EPC basis, while Transammonia Inc. of 
USA will offtake the urea output against a long-term agreement.<br>
<br>
An equally noteworthy private-led venture is the world-class methanol scheme of 
Oman Methanol Company LLC (OMC), owned by leading Omani business house Omar 
Zawawi Establishment LLC (Omzest), Methanol Holdings (Trinidad) Limited (MHTL), 
and MAN Ferrostaal AG of Germany.<br>
<br>
OMC is developing a 3,000-tonnes per day facility in the first phase, and has 
already unveiled plans for a second phase of similar capacity. Both phases will 
help establish OMC as the leader in methanol production in Oman. Commercial 
production is slated for the first quarter of 2007.<br>
<br>
Foreign investors too have been gravitating to Oman, attracted by Sohar’s 
location far removed from potential political hotspots in the Gulf, as well as 
the world-class port and communications infrastructure coming up on the Batinah 
coast. <br>
<br>
PVAXX Industries, a Bermuda-based corporation, has announced plans to develop 
the world’s largest shipping pallet manufacturing plant at the Port of Sohar at 
a cost of $230 million. The international commercial materials sales 
corporation, operating in the field of environmentally friendly composites, will 
build, own and operate a facility capable of producing 150 million shipping 
pallets per year in its initial phase of output.<br>
<br>
PVAXX industries will produce shipping pallets under the brand name ‘Siluma’, 
which unlike conventional plastic or wood-based pallets, are produced from high 
specification silica sand and polyethylene. Siluma pallets are recyclable, 
cheaper and more durable than many alternative pallets, and have been designed 
to allow customers to replace traditional wooden pallets in order to achieve 
greater cost efficiencies while simultaneously reducing the burden on the global 
environment.<br>
<br>
The company has already identified potential buyers for its biodegradable 
pallets, notably in the Far East. Letters of Intent for the sale of the first 25 
million PVAXX pallets have already been inked with parties in Iceland, South 
Africa and the GCC states.<br>
<br>
A major shot in the arm for Sohar’s vision of a true international-scale 
industrial and petrochemical hub came earlier this year when agreements were 
signed for the establishment of an integrated steel complex at the industrial 
port. UAE-based business house Al Ghaith Holding will initially invest around 
$350 million in the construction and management of a world-class steel project 
called Shadeed Iron &amp; Steel LLC. Investments could total as much as $750 million 
when subsequent phases are implemented, leading to the creation a giant facility 
rivaling in size plants already in operation in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.<br>
<br>
Shadeed Iron &amp; Steel will form the initial component of a proposed ‘Metal 
Cluster’, which will also include a planned aluminium smelter, as well as 
existing steel converting units in the Sohar area.<br>
<br>
Shadeed is establishing a plant capable of producing around 720,000 tonnes of 
hot briquetted iron (HBI) including 500,000 tonnes of steel billets. Expertise, 
based on the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) process, will be provided by US-based 
Midrex Technologies, while the Melt Shop will be erected by VAI Fuchs GmbH, 
which will supply the electric arc furnace, ladle furnace, de-dusting system, 
and continuous casting machine. Shadeed hopes to become the world’s first 
steel-maker to employ a combination of these technologies – called ‘Midrex 
Hotlink – to make its brand of ‘Hamil Steel’ products.<br>
<br>
In the third phase, a pelletisation unit will be integrated into the project, 
processing iron ore to provide the necessary raw material for the plant, thereby 
replacing imported pellets as feedstock. While phases 1 and 2 will be 
implemented over the 2007-2009 timeframe, plant capacity is proposed to be 
significantly augmented in the third phase – envisaged around 2009-2010. Output 
will rise to around 4 million tonnes per year (mtpy), which includes 2.6 mtpy of 
pellets and 1 mtpy of HBI and steel billets. Total investment in the project is 
pegged at around $750 million over the three phases.<br>
<br>
Another major triumph for the country’s industrial aspirations came in 2004 when 
the Government and other foreign investors finally nailed down a pact to build a 
giant aluminium smelter – a venture first bandied about almost a decade earlier. 
Sohar Aluminium Company was formed following the signing of a memorandum of 
understanding (MoU) on June 30 this year by state-owned Oman Oil Company, Abu 
Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA) and the Canada-based Alcan. The 
company will build a 330,000 tpa primary aluminium smelter in Sohar, which is 10 
kms inland of the Sohar Port industrial area. The smelter materials handling and 
storage facility and the 750MW dedicated power plant will be located in the port 
industrial area and metal products will be shipped from the port. <br>
<br>
Alcan, one of the world's major aluminium producers, is playing a significant 
role in the development and operation of the smelter. Following the acquisition 
of Aluminium Pechiney by Alcan in 2003, the company will also be the supplier of 
technology designated AP35 which is an evolution of the industry benchmark, 
AP30. Alcan owns 20 per cent of phase I of the smelter with an option of 
acquiring 60 per cent in a planned second potline, which would double the 
capacity of the smelter.<br>
<br>
These metal-based industries are however unlikely to dilute the predominantly 
petrochemicals character of the Sohar Industrial Port Zone. Petrochemical 
ventures are attracting the lion’s share of investment as Omani and 
international promoters see opportunities and synergies in downstream 
processing. One such mega-venture is Aromatics Oman, which is constructing a 
$1.1 billion aromatics complex at Sohar.<br>
<br>
Aromatics Oman is expected to break ground on the project by the end of the 
year. The company was established in July 2005 by Oman Oil Company, which owns 
60 per cent of its share capital. <br>
<br>
Oman Refinery Company owns a 20 per cent share, and LG International Corporation 
owns the remaining 20 per cent shareholding. <br>
<br>
This major petrochemicals facility will utilise products from the 
soon-to-be-completed Sohar Refinery and will produce over 1 million tonnes per 
annum of paraxylene and benzene, known as ‘aromatics’. Paraxylene is used 
predominantly in the production of polyester, while benzene is used in a wide 
variety of products from plastics to pharmaceuticals.<br>
<br>
Equally ambitious is a polyethylene complex under development by the Government 
of Oman, Oman Oil Company and Dow Chemical Company at a cost of $1 billion. Oman 
Petrochemicals Industries Company (OPIC) is owned 50 per cent by Dow, 25 per 
cent by the Government of Oman and 25 per cent by OOC. Located in Sohar, the 
petrochemical complex will comprise feedstock production facilities, a gas 
cracker, as well as three world-scale polyethylene production units based on 
state-of-the-art catalyst and process technology. Further, the joint venture 
will facilitate the development of downstream industries in Oman that will 
convert polyethylene to end-products in Oman thus enhancing the level of job 
creation that will result from the complex. <br>
<br>
OPIC will combine the natural gas resources of Oman with Dow's state-of-the-art 
technology position, operational expertise and marketing know-how. This 
combination will be the foundation of a strong and successful partnership that 
has tremendous potential to attract downstream customers, manufacturing 
opportunities and additional investments well into the future. <br>
<br>
The Dow Chemical Company is a leader in science and technology, providing 
innovative chemical, plastic and agricultural products and services to many 
essential consumer markets. With annual sales of $33 billion, Dow serves 
customers in more than 180 countries and a wide range of markets that are vital 
to human progress, including food, transportation, health and medicine, personal 
and home care, and building and construction, among others.<br>
<br>
Also taking shape not far from OPIC’s facilities is another petrochemical 
venture that promises to add weight to the Government’s goal of establishing a 
major plastics downstream sector in and around Sohar. Liwa Petrochemical Company 
(LPC), equally owned by Oman Oil Company, LG International (LGI) of Korea and 
National Petrochemical Company (NPC) of Iran, is developing a plant of 300,000 
tonnes of ethylene dichloride (EDC) per annum capacity, which will be used in 
the manufacture of various plastic products.<br>
<br>
LPC has signed a License, Technology and Core Equipment Supplier Agreement with 
Uhde GmbH of Germany for the EDC plant. LGI is the EPC contractor for the 
project while the feedstock will be supplied by NPC against a long-term 
agreement. Commercial production is expected in second quarter of 2008.<br>
<br>
With investments in present and future industrial and petrochemicals projects at 
Sohar now pegged at a staggering $10 billion, the Government and the landlord 
manager, SIPC, have been moving quickly to ensure that the requisite 
infrastructure, utilities and services are in place to support these ventures.
<br>
<br>
The Government has already invested in a modern deepwater port at Sohar, with 
quay walls, breakwaters, approach and turning channel, and all the requisite 
elements of an international-class maritime hub. Liquid berths are being added 
to handle a range of petrochemicals and refined oil products coming out of 
Sohar’s industries. <br>
<br>
Recently, SIPC announced the establishment of a joint venture between Hutchison 
Port Holding, Steinweg of the Netherlands and the Government of Oman, including 
local Omani investors, to operate the latest generation of container terminals 
in the Port of Sohar. The initiative is aimed at attracting container traffic 
and direct calls by the world’s leading container vessel operators.<br>
<br>
Oman International Container Terminal (OICT), as the new joint venture is 
called, will start with serving containerised shipments generated by industries 
in and around the Port of Sohar. Paving and equipment installation will start 
immediately in order to allow container operations to commence in April 2006. 
The first terminal will have two main line berths equipped with post Panamax 
gantry cranes and 16 metres of water depth. Construction of additional OICT 
container berths in Sohar will start later this year and come on stream towards 
the end of 2007 with single or double berth increments. These terminals will 
have 18 metres of water depth to be able to accommodate the container vessels of 
the future. <br>
<br>
Steinweg, which is a partner in the venture is already operating a multipurpose 
terminal at the port under a concession agreement signed in January 2004. The 
terminal, which boasts a quay wall of 750 metres and a storage area of 35 
hectares, is equipped to handle break bulk, project cargo, dry bulk and 
containers. <br>
<br>
Oiltanking Odfjell Terminals has been roped in by the Government to operate the 
port’s liquid berthing facilities in joint venture with Oman Oil Company and 
Omani Seven Seas Co. LLC. The new company plans to own and operate storage 
facilities being developed at the port area in order to export and import liquid 
cargoes. Oman Oil owns 25 per cent equity interest in the new company.<br>
<br>
With power and water demand expected to surge on the back on expanding 
industrial investment at Sohar, new generation facilities are quickly falling 
into place. <br>
<br>
Sohar Power Company, led by Belgium’s Tractebel EGI, is building a greenfield 
independent water and power facility at Sohar. The project consists of a 585MW 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines plant and a 33 million imperial gallons a day (6250 
cubic metres per hour) water desalination plant. The roughly $500 million 
project will sell electricity and water to the Oman Power and Water Procurement 
Company SAOC (PWP) under a 15-year Power and Water Purchase Agreement commencing 
on 1 April 2007. A first phase of 360 MW is scheduled to be operational on 1 
April 2006. <br>
<br>
Cooling water for the process industries will be supplied via a major Seawater 
Intake &amp; Return System financed by the Ministry of National Economy at a cost of 
roughly $57 million. The facility is designed to provide up to 334,000 cubic 
metres of cooling water per hour.<br>
<br>
Authorities have now given the go-head for expanding the capacity of the cooling 
water intake and return system to cater to new industries that were finalised 
after the initial phase was conceived and constructed.<br>
<br>
Explaining the advantages of Sohar Port, Hussain AbdulHussain, Business 
Operations Director, Oman Petrochemical Industries Company (OPIC), says: “At 
Sohar, we have the biggest plot (about 2 million sq m). The port is very 
advantageous to the project for a variety of reasons. We’ll have several raw 
materials coming to the plant and the port will support us. We’ll have a lot of 
products. We’ll have liquid products (LPGs), and solid products. And both will 
be exported from Sohar. And that’s why Sohar is very important. Sohar has 
several other incentives, like the cooling seawater for example, that the 
government has established.”<br>
<br>
He adds: “And of course Sohar will also help because the final products can be 
shipped again from this port. Then, there are also the government incentives for 
the people to be in Sohar.”<br>
<br>
Indeed, at the rate at which the industrial port is developing, experts predict 
an industrial hub rivaling some of the biggest in the Gulf region. It’s a vision 
that few in Oman ever dreamed of a decade ago – an industrial juggernaut that 
promises to transform the country’s economic landscape.

    Sheikha Al Farrsi, Director, Investment Department, The Omani Center for 
    Investment Promotion and Export Development (OCIPED), in an interview with 
    OER, outlines the strengths of Sohar as a major investment destination in 
    the region</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>How is Sohar shaping up as an industrial hub for the region in the 
    corridor between this port city and Dubai?</b><br>
    The discovery and commercial exploitation of natural gas and its immense 
    potential as the source of energy and feedstock for the manufacture of 
    several value added industrial products has changed the dimensions of growth 
    potential and diversification of the manufacturing sector in Oman. <br>
    <br>
    The total investment in gas based industry sector projects, currently under 
    construction in Sohar, is in the region of US $ 10 billion. This includes 
    polypropylene, petroleum refinery, fertilizer, methanol, polyethylene, 
    aluminium, steel, ethylene dichloride, aromatic complex etc. These projects 
    are expected to go on stream at the various periods of 2006-2008. <br>
    <br>
    The world-class industrial port is already operational. The industrial and 
    infrastructure development at Sohar, the most populous region of the 
    country, will develop Sohar as the major heavy industrial area. <br>
    <br>
    It is also part of the strategy to ensure a better balance in economic 
    activity and job opportunities in the various regions of Oman. World’s 
    technology leaders like Dow Chemicals, Alcan, LG International, Ferrostaal 
    etc. are partnering in joint ventures with various mega industrial projects 
    in Oman, bringing in investments and the latest technology in the respective 
    fields to the country. <br>
    <br>
    <b>What promise does Sohar hold out for Oman, i.e. as the industrial hub of 
    Oman?</b><br>
    Once these mega projects are implemented as planned, Sohar will develop as 
    the major heavy industrial area. It will pave way for numerous investment 
    opportunities in downstream and ancillary projects, specifically in 
    petrochemicals, metals etc. Additional logistics and infrastructure 
    requirement, potential for growth in the real estate in terms of residential 
    properties, hotels, restaurants and other tourism projects to support these 
    projects would be huge. There will also be substantial additional 
    investments in these areas.<br>
    <b><br>
    What makes Sohar an ideal investment destination? And what are the distinct 
    advantages of Sohar for a foreign investor?</b><br>
    Sohar’s strategic location as a mid way between the two major business 
    centers in the region, fully developed industrial port and development of 
    major natural gas based industrial projects with an estimated investment of 
    about US $ 10 billion, makes it an ideal location for investment. <br>
    <br>
    Then, as mentioned earlier, it is the most populous region in the Oman and 
    this, in the long run, will prove beneficial for the enterprises to train 
    and employ the nationals and to retain them. The government is further 
    committed to develop it with the active participation of the private sector 
    in the form of the entire support services like logistics, ancillary 
    industries, service providers and social infrastructure for the business.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>How encouraging has been the response of the foreign investors so far?</b><br>
    As far as the major projects are concerned, we have succeeded in bringing in 
    the global leaders. This has completely changed the perception of Oman to 
    the global business community. <br>
    <br>
    Now, many major companies are looking at Oman, and especially Sohar, as the 
    destination for investment. There is huge potential to develop ancillary 
    projects in various sectors and many foreign companies are keen to invest in 
    these projects.<br>
    <br>
    <b>How competitive can Sohar be compared to, for example, the Jebel Ali Free 
    Zone in Dubai?</b><br>
    It may not be appropriate to compare Jabel Ali with Sohar. Jabel Ali is a 
    Free Trade Zone, whereas Sohar is an industrial area. In Jabel Ali, there 
    are trading operations, manufacturing companies and regional offices of the 
    international companies. However, in the case of Sohar, the focus is on 
    developing it as an energy cluster. The mega gas-based industries would be 
    nucleus of this energy cluster and the private sector is expected to play a 
    leading role in developing the support services.<br>
    <b><br>
    Sohar is being billed as the new route to Middle East’s growth. How 
    realistic are such expectations? </b><br>
    The investment in the mega projects is expected to be in the region of US $ 
    10 billion. This investment is slated to be completed in the next two to 
    three years. The massive construction activities that are now taking place 
    in Sohar tells the story. <br>
    It may also be relevant to point out that according to Sohar Development 
    Group (SDG), it is estimated that when industries in Sohar mature, there 
    will be around 10,000 people employed by them. Investments touching 
    multi-million-riyals will pour into real estate development in Sohar in the 
    coming years as SDG has identified nine major areas for development, 
    including housing, hotels/motels, international school and health 
    facilities.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Where does this special economic zone stand in comparison to the major 
    economic zones in the GCC as a whole? </b><br>
    It may not be proper to say that Sohar’s development is a unique project. 
    However, any similar project in any other country of the world would have 
    certain distinctive features, which would make it competitive for certain 
    activities. <br>
    <br>
    The global business community in this modern era of communication has access 
    to information. Therefore, the success and failure of any such major 
    infrastructure projects could best be judged by the participation of the 
    international companies. <br>
    As far as Sohar is concerned, the participation of Port of Rotterdam, Alcan, 
    LG, Dow Chemicals and Ferrostaal in the major projects is clear proof of the 
    success of this project. <br>
    <br>
    OCIPED is working in close coordination with other organizations to promote 
    this region for further developments and the response has been highly 
    encouraging. Many major companies from the region and from other continents 
    have shown great interest to invest in projects in Sohar. </font></td>

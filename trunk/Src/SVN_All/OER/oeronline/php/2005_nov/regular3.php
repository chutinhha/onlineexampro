Electronics has ushered in a new age of home entertainment experience with the 
launch of the world’s first slim fit CRT TV in the Middle East. A design 
revolution that breaks away from the conventional type of CTV, the slim fit 
model’s outer chassis is in dual tone of black and silver with the inner bezel 
in black to enhance contrast. It is available in three different sizes — 39’’, 
29’’ and 21’’. Aesthetically, this HD ready TV is similar to a LCD TV and a 
Plasma TV, but is priced at less than half of a normal 32” LCD TV. “The 
state-of-art slim fit TV has several advantages with a front FP TV design 
(interior impact), HD picture quality (1080i/ 480p compatible) and a flexible 
display,” said Ashraf Sajid, Senior Manager, Sales and Marketing, Samsung Gulf 
Electronics.</font></p><hr width="70%" size="1">
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Best Performer and Editor’s 
Choice for P910i<br>
</b><br>
Sony Ericsson has been selected as the SmartPhone Manufacturer of the Year Award
<b>
<img border="1" src="editors_choice.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="113"></b>according 
to PC Magazine, one of the ICT publications in the Middle East. The citation was 
announced during the annual PC Magazine Middle and Near East Awards Ceremony.<br>
<br>
“We are proud to receive this award from PC Magazine,” said Husni Al-Assi, 
General Manager of Sony Ericsson, Middle East and Africa. “We at Sony Ericsson 
have always maintained high standards for product quality and innovation and 
this honour attests to that.”<br>
<br>
The P910i is Sony Ericsson’s flagship product in SmartPhone category. Since its 
launch, the P910i has been a favourite among users who prefer mobile phones that 
efficiently combine PDA-style functionality with advanced mobile phone 
technology.<br>
<br>
PC Magazine cited the Sony Ericsson P910i with the Best Performer and Editor’s 
Choice Awards for having the most preferred features such as Triband GSM, MP3 
playback, MPEG4 video playback, standard office application suite, PDF viewer, 
email client, and web browser, among others. <br>
<br>
The P910i also features a VGA resolution camera. Its 3.2-inch LCD screen, while 
not the largest, is of exceptional quality. The mobile had two levels of data 
inputs and a full QWERTY keypad. It even had a touch screen for PDA 
functionality. <br>
<br>
The best performer award was also given away to Sony Ericsson P910i because of 
its excellent speaker quality and an exceptional battery life, which was rated 
at three times the average smart phone.</font></p><hr width="70%" size="1">

</b><br>
<b><img border="1" src="lg.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="98"></b>LG 
Electronics recently unveiled the world’s first terrestrial digital multimedia 
broadcasting-receiving mobile phone in the Middle East. <br>
<br>
With this phone, LG has resolved the problems surrounding the bulky size and 
power consumption; users can watch terrestrial DMB TV and speak simultaneously 
via mobile phone. The handset incorporates DSP (Digital Signal Processor)-based 
SoC (System-on-Chip) with LG’s handset design technology and terrestrial 
broadcasting-receiving chip, to give it the edge in size, performance and 
convenience in use. <br>
<br>
“This breakthrough in DMB technology will open up a world of mobile 
possibilities and gives us the momentum to lead the multimedia mobile handset 
revolution,” said C H Lee, president, LG Electronics Gulf FZE. “By overtaking 
Europe in launching the terrestrial DMB phone, we can have a bigger voice in 
setting global standards. Using the terrestrial DMB phone technologies, LG will 
aggressively penetrate markets, including Europe, South America and China. I am 
convinced this will help us achieve our goal of being among the top three 
players in the global handset industry by 2006.”<br>
<br>
The SB-120 mobile broadcasting phone provides crystal-clear video, CD-quality 
audio and satellite-transmitted data. Contrary to conventional satellite DMB 
models, users can receive video-on-the-move services on a 360-degree pull back 
monitor. The unit has a two mega-pixel camera supporting auto focus functions 
and a TV-out cable through which users can connect television sets to watch DMB 
programmes on a full screen televisions</font></p><hr width="70%" size="1">

<br>

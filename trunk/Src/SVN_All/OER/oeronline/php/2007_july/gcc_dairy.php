        Pvt equity fundraising to reach US$25 bn<br>

        for just under a third of the total US$33.2 billion raised across the

		<img border="0" src="gcc.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Private equity fundraising in the Middle East could reach US$25 billion 
        in the near future, according to a report, ‘The Impact of Private Equity 
        on the GCC’. Produced jointly by Ithmar Capital, a GCC-focused private 
        equity firm, and Dow Jones, the report states that in the GCC 
        “fundraising is exhibiting strong growth with 41 per cent of the funds 
        raised between 1994 and 2005 raised in the final year of this period, 
        and then this total of US$5.8 billion almost doubling in 2006.”<br>
		<br>
        Growth in the private equity markets in the GCC is being driven by rapid 
        economic growth and restructuring, high liquidity from record energy 
        prices, significant fiscal and trade surpluses and heightened interest 
        in the region from international firms looking to hedge investment risks 
        and compete globally, says the report. Nonetheless, it concludes that 
        the “region is still underdeveloped compared to other geographies and 
        accounts for only a small proportion of the region’s overall economic 
        activity.” The report then says: “Fundraising in the GCC area reached 
        US$10 billion in 2006, accounting for just under a third of the total 
        US$33.2 billion raised across the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern 
        Europe, Latin America and the MENA region.”<br>
		<br>
        The report points to some specific benefits from a growth of private 
        equity in the GCC including, improved economic diversification and 
        support for the existing positive liquidity climate as well as for 
        growth of a viable private sector. “GCC states have identified assets 
        valued at more than US$1 trillion for privatisation, and public 
        infrastructure accounted for more than 60 per cent of new funds raised 
        by regional private equity firms in 2006. Governments in the region are 
        also likely to look to external capital sources to address shortfalls in 
        infrastructure financing and growing pressure on public resources 
        attendant on the GCC’s rapid population growth,” says the report.<br>
		<br>
        However, there are several challenges to realising the potential of 
        private equity in the GCC, points out the report. The first is the 
        reluctance of family businesses to give up controlling stakes, thereby 
        limiting exit opportunities. The presence of inconsistent regional legal 
        and tax regimes is the second challenge with underdeveloped human 
        capital and management pools being the third. The fourth challenge is 
        strong investor interest in government-owned infrastructure, which 
        reinforces existing structures, restricts technology development and 
        limits diversification.<br>

        <b>Investment in chemicals rises</b><br>
        Arab Gulf countries invested about US$70 billion in chemical and 
        petrochemical industries in 2006, five per cent more than they did in 
        2005, a pan-Gulf organisation that monitors such projects has said. 
        Saudi Arabia accounted for nearly 63 per cent of total Gulf Cooperation 
        Council (GCC) investment made in petrochemical projects, according to 
        Qatar-based Gulf Organisation for Industrial Consulting (GOIC).<br>
		<br>
        The investment in the petrochemical sector was 59 per cent of about 
        US$118 billion the region spent on all industrial projects during the 
        year. The UAE’s investment in the sector was US$5.8 billion, which 
        represented 46 per cent of total investment in industrial projects. 
        Qatar was the second biggest GCC investor in petrochemical industries at 
        US$9.6 billion, followed by Kuwait with US$6.1 billion.<br>
		<br>
        GOIC said the average growth of Gulf investments in petrochemicals and 
        chemical industries between 2000 and 2006 was about five per cent. The 
        number of people employed in these industries increased 4.9 per cent to 
        163,134 last year compared with the previous year. Investment in 
        petrochemical facilities is driven by availability of cheap feedstock 
        and the region’s proximity to large markets of Asia such as China and 
        India. <br>
		<br>
        More than 30 million tonnes per year of ethylene capacity will be added 
        in the Middle East by 2012-13, according to London-based Chemical Week. 
        The new capacity is also likely to put pressure on global petrochemical 
        markets. Steam crackers coming onstream from 2008 in Kuwait, Qatar and 
        Saudi Arabia will cause an imbalance in worldwide supply and demand, 
        lowering petrochemical plant operating rates and leading to a softening 
        in prices, it quoted industry analysts as saying. Some projects may be 
        delayed or cancelled as engineering, procurement and construction costs 
        in the Middle East have inflated faster than other places. </font></p>

        Rakeen to develop Ras Al Khaimah Financial City</b><br>
        Rakeen, a leading developer in Ras Al Khaimah under the patronage of His 
        Highness Sheikh Saud Saqr Al Qasimi, Crown Prince and Deputy Ruler of 
        Ras Al Khaimah, will develop a Financial City in the Emirate. The 
        development, which will be named Ras Al Khaimah Financial City, is the 
        hub of RAK Offshore project currently under development by the RAK 
        Investment Authority, RAKIA. The city will consist of 12 designed towers 
        and is set to act as a regional financial centre.<br>
		<br>
        The RAK Offshore project is the new centre for financial operations of 
        the regional business community that will offer financial, legal, 
        l<img border="0" src="gcc3.jpg" width="250" height="166" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">ogistic and insurance services in a free zone environment. RAK Offshore 
        will be owned by Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority and will facilitate 
        the operational and legislative requirements of the Emirate.<br>
		<br>
        Meanwhile, the company has appointed Hey Detina, a renowned New 
        York-based architect. “The development will be a landmark on the 
        coastline of the Arabian Gulf and its design is something Rakeen is very 
        proud of. However, it is also crucial that Ras Al Khaimah has a centre 
        of financial strength that will further instigate the growth of the 
        Emirate and we are sure that is what RAK Financial City will do,” said 
        Dr Khater Massaad, Executive Chairman of Rakeen.</font></p>

        <b>Porta Reef Investment Fund launched</b><br>
        <b>
		<img border="0" src="gcc5.jpg" width="105" height="109" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>Abu Dhabi Investment House, a leading financial institution in the 
        Middle East, has launched Porta Reef Investment Fund. The fund aims to 
        invest in the Porta Reef project, to be developed within Reef Island in 
        the Kingdom of Bahrain. Reef Island, a man-made island being built on 
        the coast of the Bahraini capital Al Manama, was previously known as 
        Lulu Island and covers a total area of 579,000 square metres. Porta 
        Reef, located in the southern part of Reef Island, extends over 16,016 
        square metres and is divided into three land plots to be developed into 
        three residential towers with luxurious apartments. The total cost of 
        the project is US$90 million. The Reef Island includes apartments, 
        residential buildings, villas, beach villas and a 250-room 5-star hotel 
        and spa.<br>
		<br>
        The building construction will commence middle of this year with the 
        first phase scheduled to be completed in early 2009 and the second by 
        2010-end.<br>
		<br>
        Fawaz Al Jowder, Director of Investment in Abu Dhabi Investment House, 
        said: “Porta Reef Investment Fund is the second fund that Abu Dhabi 
        Investment House launched in two weeks. Earlier, Sunset Hills Fund was 
        launched in cooperation with Sorooh Investment Company. This fund is 
        expected to yield targeted annual return of 20 per cent over 24 months, 
        Al Jowder confirmed, “Porta Reef targets middle and high-income citizens 
        or residents in the Gulf.”<br>

        ADIH has been associated with major landmark infrastructure projects 
        across the region including Beirut Gate, Entertainment City Qatar, 
        Sunset Hills and The Lagoon on Amwaj Islands both in the Kingdom of

        A consortium of Suez Energy International, Gulf Investment Corporation 
        and the Arabian Company for Water and Power Projects has completed 
        limited recourse financing for the Marafiq Independent Water and Power 
        Project (IWPP) in Jubail, Saudi Arabia.<br>
		<br>
        A syndicate of 29 international, regional and Saudi banks is providing 
        loans to the tune of US$3.44 billion to the project.<br>
		<br>
        The Marafiq IWPP is a 23-year BOOT (build, own, operate, transfer) 
        contract for a 2,750-megawatt combined cycle power station and a large 
        water desalination facility with a capacity of 800 million gallons per 
        day. The consortium owns 60 per cent of the project, with the remaining 
        40 per cent held by Marafiq, the Saudi Electricity Company and the 
        Public Investment Fund.<br>
		<br>
        The power and water output from the facility will be sold under a single 
        off-take contract to a wholly owned subsidiary of Marafiq. The EPC 
        contract was awarded to a consortium comprising General Electric, 
        Hyundai Heavy Industries and Societe Internationale de Dessalement. <br>
		<br>
        “This is the largest project finance deal ever signed in the power 
        sector so far. It is a clear demonstration of our strong commitment to 
        both Saudi Arabia and the Middle-East”, said Dirk Beeuwsaert, Suez 
        Energy International’s Chief Executive Officer. “The arrangement of this 
        combined conventional and Islamic financing providing over 80 per cent 
        of the funds for the project, is a major achievement for all the 
        sponsors.”<br>
		<br>
        The financing is in five parts – a 22-year loan of US$1.57 billion, an 
        export facility of US$645 million provided by the Korea Export Insurance 
        Corporation, an Islamic Ijara facility of US$600 million, an equity 
        bridge facility of $496 million, and a debt service reserve account 
        facility of US$130 million.<br>
		<br>
        The syndicate is led by BNP Paribas, Gulf International Bank and SAMBA 
        Financial Group, together with Bank Saudi Fransi, Arab National Bank, 
        Saudi British Bank, Saudi Hollandi Bank, Arab Petroleum Investments 
        Corporation (Apicorp), Bayerische LB, Bank Of Tokyo Mitsubishi – UFJ, 
        Calyon, Dexia Credit Local, DZ Bank, Fortis Bank, HSBC, ING Bank, KBC,

        Corporation, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered Bank, West LB, Arab 
        Bank, Mashreq, Shinhan Bank, and Woori Global Markets Asia Limited.<br>
		<br>
        The Islamic facility is provided by three Saudi banks: Riyad Bank, Al 
        Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation and National Commercial Bank. 
        The debt service reserve account facility is provided by Bahrain-based

        <b>Kuwait investors to manage US$200-mn Indian fund</b><br>
        Bahrain-based Khaleej Finance and Investment (KFI) has joined hands with 
        Kuwaiti investors to manage a US$200-million Indian Private Equity Fund. 
        KFI, Kuwait Investment Company (KIC) and Kuwait Finance House (KFH), 
        also known as Baytak, have signed a partnership agreement to manage and 
        promote the Sharia-compliant fund, targeting a variety of activities 
        with controlled risks in growing sectors, particularly real estate and 
        industry in India.<br>
		<br>
        The fund is designed to reach an internal rate of return exceeding 25 
        per cent at the end of the investment period of five years. It has an 
        investment period ranging between three and five years and is partially 
        underwritten in Kuwait by Warba Investment Company.<br>
		<br>
        KFI Chief Executive Nabil Hadi, Baytak General Manager Mohammed al-Omar 
        and KIC chairman Badr al-Sbei said it represents a strategic step 
        forward for their institutions. “The Indian Private Equity fund 
        constitutes a qualitative change in the activities of KFI and is 
        designed to help the bank go beyond the regional level,” Hadi said.<br>
		<br>
        Talking on the partnership between KFI, KIC and KFH, Hadi said, “This 
        partnership comes as part of the bank’s strategic vision of building 
        alliances and strong long term relationships with banks and investment 
        institutions in the GCC countries.”<br>
		<br>
        KFH-Baytak General Manager Mohammed Al Omar said, “We found that Indian 
        Private Equity Fund has diversified the targeted sectors and distributed 
        the allocations in a way that satisfies investors and minimises 
        potential risks on their investments.”<br>
		<br>
        KIC Chairman Nasser Al Sbei announced that KIC and KFH are the 
        co-managers, co-promoters and co-placement agents of the Indian Private 
        Equity Fund, while KFI is the arranger, the lead manager, the 
        co-promoter and co-placement agent.<br>

        <b>Qatar-backed fund ups Sainsbury stake to 25 per cent</b><br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc8.jpg" width="250" height="166" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Delta (Two), a Qatar-backed property investment fund, has raised its 
        stake in J Sainsbury Plc to 25 per cent by purchasing US$1.4 billion of 
        stock, making it the biggest shareholder. The fund acquired 7.1 per cent 
        of the UK’s third-largest supermarket chain for 595 pence a share, Delta 
        has said. Delta is run by Paul Taylor, the former chief executive 
        officer of Rotch Property Group, a company owned by the billionaire 
        Tchenguiz brothers. Robert Tchenguiz holds 5 per cent of London-based 
        Sainsbury.<br>
		<br>
        Shares of the retailer rose to the highest in at least 18 years, giving 
        the company a market value of more than £10 billion. Sainsbury, whose 
        £8.6 billion of real estate has lured potential bidders, avoided being 
        taken over by CVC Capital Partners Ltd in April and said it won’t be 
        pressured into disposals. Delta’s stake is now larger than that of the 
        Sainsbury family, which owns about 18 per cent. “These guys will want a 
        say in what happens at the company and will want a better balance 
        sheet,’’ said James Bevan, who helps manage US$8.9 billion as Chief 
        Investment Officer at CCLA Investment Management. “We shouldn’t assume 
        that just because companies take big stakes they have predatory 
        intentions. They may just want a bigger say in how the company is run.”<br>
		<br>
        UK retailers and pub owners have come under pressure to separate 
        operating and real estate units since a new law came into effect this 
        year, allowing property divisions to trade separately as real estate 
        investment trusts (REITs), which qualify for lower taxes. CVC, lured by 
        the retailer’s real estate, failed to buy Sainsbury for £10 billion 
        after it was abandoned by its bidding partners and the grocery chain’s 
        founding family held out for more money. Sainsbury said in March it has 
        “right to retain ownership” of the land and that while it has considered 
        opportunities to raise money from its property, “now is not the time’’.

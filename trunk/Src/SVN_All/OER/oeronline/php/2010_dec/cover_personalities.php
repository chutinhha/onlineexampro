                    San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace 
                    laureate, has come to symbolise the struggle of Myanmar’s 
                    people to be free. She has spent more than 15 years in 
                    detention, most of it under house arrest and was released 
                    from her current third period of detention in November.<br>
                    <br>
                    Like the South African leader Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu 
                    Kyi has become an international symbol of peaceful 
                    resistance in the face of oppression. The 65-year-old has 
                    spent most of the last 20 years in some form of detention 
                    because of her efforts to bring democracy to military-ruled 
                    Myanmar.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1991, a year after her National League for Democracy won 
                    an overwhelming victory in an election the junta later 
                    nullified, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.<br>
                    <br>
                    Suu Kyi is the daughter of the country’s independence hero, 
                    General Aung San. He was assassinated during the transition 
                    period in July 1947, just six months before independence. 
                    Suu Kyi was only two years old at the time. In 1960, she 
                    went to Delhi with her mother Daw Khin Kyi, who had been 
                    appointed Burma’s ambassador to India. Four years later she 
                    went to Oxford University in the UK, where she studied 
                    philosophy, politics and economics. There she met her future 
                    husband, academic Michael Aris. Suu Kyi was soon propelled 
                    into leading the revolt against the then-dictator, General 
                    Ne Win. She was inspired by the non-violent campaigns of US 
                    civil rights leader Martin Luther King and India’s Mahatma 
                    Gandhi.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                    <br>
                    Mexican tycoon, Carlos Slim, 70, has amassed a fortune of 
                    $53.5bn, beating Microsoft founder Bill Gates to top the 
                    list of the world’s richest people, according to a ranking 
                    published by Forbes magazine. His far-flung business empire 
                    includes some of Mexico’s best-known department stores, its 
                    biggest telecom operator, hotels, restaurants, oil drilling, 
                    building firms and Inbursa bank making it hard to spend a 
                    day in Mexico without paying him some money. Outside Mexico 
                    Slim has holdings in such prestigious groups as retailer 
                    Saks and New York Times Co. His defining foray occurred in 
                    1990 when he and his partners bought creaking state 
                    telephone company Telmex for $1.7bn. Turning it into a 
                    cash-making jewel, he spun off America Movil and expanded it 
                    through acquisitions to become the world’s No 4 wireless 
                    operator.<br>
                    <br>
                    Slim first showed a talent for business as a 10-year-old kid 
                    when he filled his pockets with pesos selling drinks and 
                    snacks to his family. As a youngster he also kept accounting 
                    ledgers of what he earned and spent and bought a government 
                    savings bond from which he learned valuable lessons about 
                    compound interest.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                    2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to imprisoned Chinese 
                    human rights activist Liu Xiaobo “for his long and 
                    non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China”. 
                    The laureate, a little-known figure inside China due to 
                    official censorship, is a veteran of the Tiananmen Square 
                    protests of 1989, and co-author of the Charter 08 manifesto 
                    for which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison by Chinese 
                    authorities on 25 December 2009. Liu was chosen over a 
                    record number of nominations – more than 200 – to receive 
                    the Nobel award.<br>
                    <br>
                    Liu is also the third person to be awarded the Nobel Peace 
                    Prize while in prison or detention, after Germany’s Carl von 
                    Ossietzky (1935) and Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi (1991).<br>
                    <br>
                    Intellectuals and politicians from the international 
                    community praised the decision, although the Chinese 
                    government bitterly attacked the decision. Heavy official 
                    censorship was applied on the Internet, on television and in 
                    the print media inside China following the announcement. <br>
                    <br>
                    Liu is the first Chinese (excluding the 14th Dalai Lama, a 
                    refugee) to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the first 
                    to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in 
                    China.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                    who performs under the stage name Lady Gaga, has become a 
                    pop icon by combining dance numbers with performance art to 
                    create something that appeals to teenagers and critics 
                    alike.<br>
                    <br>
                    The 24-year-old singer, songwriter and musician from New 
                    York began her career as a songwriter for some of pop 
                    music’s biggest stars but her true influence lies in her 
                    ability to weave fashion, choreography, visual art and a 
                    wide variety of pop-based musical styles into one cohesive, 
                    compelling performance.<br>
                    <br>
                    Gaga’s influence on modern culture and society has provoked 
                    the University of South Carolina into offering a full-time 
                    course titled ‘Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame’ in the 
                    objective of unravelling “the sociologically relevant 
                    dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga with respect to her 
                    music, videos, fashion, and other artistic endeavours”. She 
                    has been called the next Madonna.<br>
                    <br>
                    This year, she became the first artist to hit the five 
                    million mark in digital singles sales and the first 
                    celebrity to get more than 10 million fans on Facebook; her

                    executives and celebrities to rank as the world’s most 
                    powerful woman in Forbes magazine’s annual listing. Obama 
                    has been a ‘true change-maker’ since coming to the White 
                    House, said Forbes, citing her high approval ratings, her 
                    status as a role model and her campaign against childhood 
                    obesity. The women on the business magazine’s list were 
                    ‘shaping many of the agenda-setting conversations of the 
                    day’. These women have built companies and brands, sometimes 
                    by non-traditional means and they have broken through gender 
                    barriers in areas of commerce, politics, sports and media 
                    and cultural zeitgeist.<br>
                    <br>
                    This year Forbes changed the way it ranked women, basing the 
                    list less on wealth and power and more on creative influence 
                    and entrepreneurship. Forbes said Obama topped the list this 
                    year because “she has made the office of first lady her own” 
                    while remaining popular. Michelle is also effective: In 
                    response to her Let’s Move! campaign against childhood 
                    obesity, companies like Coca-Cola, Kellogg and General Mills

                    previously served as chief executive of Pixar Animation

                    Prince William and Kate Middleton will marry at Westminster 
                    Abbey in London on April 29 and the day will be marked by a 
                    public holiday. Prince William Arthur Philip Louis of Wales, 
                    KG, FRS (born June 21, 1982), is the elder son of Charles, 
                    Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, and grandson 
                    of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. 
                    He is second in the line of succession, behind his father, 
                    to the thrones of 16 independent states. Since their 
                    relationship began, Catherine Elizabeth ‘Kate’ Middleton 
                    (born  January 9, 1982) has received widespread media 
                    attention. The office of the Prince of Wales at Clarence 
                    House announced the marriage would take place on April 29, 
                    2011, at Westminster Abbey.<br>

                    beating The Netherlands 1-0 and ended their drought of 
                    winning major tournaments. Other than Euro championships in 
                    1964 and 2008, they rarely have been in contention in other 
                    competitions. At least the Netherlands made two World Cup 
                    finals and also got to the semi-finals in 1998.<br>
                    <br>
                    Second-ranked Spain started their World Cup in the worst 
                    way, losing to Switzerland in the group matches. But it won 
                    every game after that, including a 1-0 victory over powerful 
                    Germany that was far more one-sided than the score 
                    indicated. No other nation has won the World Cup after 
                    losing its opener.<br>

                    In the final against Holland, it was Andres Iniesta who 
                    broke free in the penalty area to collect a pass from Cesc 
                    Fabregas and take a right-footed shot from eight yards just

                    The German-born Benedict XVI who succeeded John Paul as the 
                    Catholic Church’s 265th pope on April 19, 2005, has been in 
                    the news for his non-conformist views that have alienated 
                    the devotees but brought cheer among the so-called 
                    non-believers.<br>
                    <br>
                    In an interview conducted by Peter Seewald titled, ‘Light of 
                    the World’, Pope Benedict XVI’s announced that condom use 
                    may be the best choice in some circumstances. This statement 
                    is considered a watershed, because it is the first time that 
                    the public health has entered the Catholic Canon. And it is 
                    also a departure from the Catholic position, repeatedly 
                    endorsed earlier by Benedict, that, there is no possible 
                    role for condoms or other forms of artificial contraception 
                    since the legitimate purpose of the act of procreation 
                    within marriage was to produce children.</font><p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was elected after the death 
                    of the popular and long-serving Pope John Paul II, and took 
                    the name Benedict XVI, is a bookish scholar with a strong 
                    theological bent, and experts predicted that he would not 
                    inspire the same sort of public adoration as his 
                    predecessor.<br>
                    <br>
                    But he remained in the news nevertheless as Benedict’s 
                    papacy went from crisis to crisis. Benedict faced 
                    accusations that he and direct subordinates often did not 
                    alert civilian authorities or discipline priests involved in 
                    sexual abuse. In 2006, Benedict enraged many Muslims, when 
                    he quoted a Byzantine emperor who called Islam ‘evil and 
                    inhuman’. In January 2009 he sparked outrage across Europe 
                    when he revoked the excommunication of schismatic bishops 
                    who had denied central elements of the Holocaust.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                    <img border="0" src="images/cover26.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="6" width="175" height="196">On 5 August 2010, a cave-in occurred at the San José 
                    copper-gold mine in the Atacama Desert near Copiapó, Chile. 
                    The accident left 33 men trapped 700 metres (2,300 ft) below 
                    ground. The miners survived underground for a record 69 
                    days. All 33 were rescued and brought to the surface on 13 
                    October 2010.<br>
                    <br>
                    The 69 days they spent before the rescue is the longest 
                    anyone has been trapped underground and lived.<br>
                    <br>
                    Their story of survival captured global attention. Some 
                    1,500 journalists were at the mine to report on the rescue 
                    operation, which was broadcast live around the world, 
                    including dramatic live images of the miners hugging 
                    rescuers who traveled down the shaft to their refuge deep in 
                    the mine.<br>
                    <br>
                    But the main hero for the Chilean miners trapped half a mile 
                    underground by 700,000 tonnes of rock, is Luis Urzua, 54, 
                    who was the shift commander at the time of the disaster. 
                    Urzua used all his wits and his leadership skills to help 
                    his men remain calm for the 17 harrowing days it took for 
                    rescuers to make their first contact.<br>
                    <br>
                    Rescuers had found the men miraculously alive with a bore 
                    hole the width of a grapefruit. It served as a lifeline to 
                    pass hydration gels, water and food, as well as bibles, 
                    letters from their families and soccer videos to keep their 
                    spirits up.<br>
                    <br>
                    The total cost of the rescue operation was estimated at 
                    $20mn, a third covered by private donations with the rest 
                    coming from state-owned mining corporation Codelco and the 
                    government itself.</font><hr color="#000000" size="1">

                Omantel also introduced a slew of packages to Mada post-paid

                In a fast changing world where developments occur rapidly making 
                every new technology obsolete in days, change is unavoidable and 
                a rudimentary necessity, especially in the print media. 
                Recognising this trend, Ahmed Essa Al Zedjali, CEO, Muscat Press 
                and Publishing House, embarked upon changing the face of the two 
                dailies published by the company – Times of Oman and Al Shabiba.<br>
                <br>
                Today, both the newspapers have a stunning new look with a 
                complete facelift both in terms of design and editorial; size of 
                the papers; as well as contemporary masthead logos. The new size 
                followed by Times of Oman and Al Shabiba is used by most 
                well-known dailies like USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Times of

                Activities are underway for celebrating Oman LNG’s 10 years of 
                operations in the Sultanate and partnership with the government 
                to achieve His Majesty’s 2020 goals of sustainable economic 
                growth and diversification. Dr Brian Buckley, GM &amp; CEO believes 
                that gas has been the game-changer of the last decade for Oman 
                as gas has become the largest single revenue generator for Oman 
                after oil and the greatest catalyst for the diversification of 
                Oman’s economic base.<br>
                <br>
                Oman LNG stands as a major contributor to the Sultanate’s 
                revenue stream and has attracted many laurels within only a 
                decade as an active player in the global LNG industry. In 2002, 
                only two years into operations, the company achieved its first 
                nine million man-hours without Lost Time Injury (LTI). At 
                present the company contributes around 10 per cent to Oman’s 
                GDP.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 10px; ">

                Freezone Sohar (FzS), an ambitious free zone venture taking 
                shape alongside the Port of Sohar, has been attracting the eyes 
                of international investors. Authorities have drawn up 
                investor-friendly regulatory policies and a range of fiscal 
                incentives under a freezone law to be promulgated soon. Freezone 
                Sohar is being developed by Sohar International Development 
                Company (SIDC), a 50:50 joint venture between the Government of 
                Oman and Port of Rotterdam, and SKIL Infrastructure Limited of 
                India.<br>
                <br>
                Freezone Sohar, says Aziz, has an enormous investment appeal 
                given its proximity to a world-class port; the planned 
                establishment of an international airport and rail network, and 
                other transport infrastructure in the Batinah region. The 
                freezone aims to attract downstream investments that add value 
                to base industries, chiefly petrochemicals and metals, currently 
                in operation at the Sohar Port.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 10px; ">

                John Malcolm, former managing director of Petroleum Development 
                Oman (PDO), in September, was conferred “Oman Civil Order” Third 
                Class by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said in appreciation of 
                his good efforts in promoting the Omani oil sector. Malcolm had 
                spearheaded the 60 per cent government owned PDO since November 
                2002 with his single point agenda being to enhance the oil 
                production of the company. For a country which relies heavily on 
                oil production to generate its national income, Malcolm’s role 
                was to find ways and means to reverse the falling oil production 
                of the company. He led a three-pronged EOR effort using thermal, 
                chemical (mainly polymer injection) and miscible gas. Malcolm 
                said the share of PDO’s liquids produced by EOR will rise to 36 
                per cent in 2018 from 3 per cent in 2008.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 10px; ">

                Hyundai car sales in the Sultanate recorded an impressive 57 per 
                cent increase till September 2010 compared to the corresponding 
                period of 2009 and OTE has considerably contributed to the 
                Hyundai Motor Corporation’s achievement under the leadership of 
                Sheikh Saad Suhail Bahwan. Hyundai’s global success can be 
                attributed to the emphasis on improving product quality, he 
                said. In a short span of time, Hyundai has become the auto 
                industry’s quality leader.<br>
                <br>
                “Thanks to the exceptional support from Hyundai Motor Company 
                and in particular, the Middle East Headquarters under the 
                leadership of BT Shin, I would like to say that Hyundai in Oman 
                has had huge increase in sales this year and has recorded one of 
                the largest market share growths in the country,” says Sheikh 
                Saad.<br>

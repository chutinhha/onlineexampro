                        <br>
                        As part of the agreement, Omantel will build and operate 
                        a Convergent Government Network to connect governmental 
                        sites across the Sultanate. A pilot project of the 
                        Convergent Government Network was conducted prior to 
                        signing the agreement. The pilot project connected about 
                        30 sites across four ministries. It is estimated that 
                        over 415 sites of different ministries will be connected 
                        to the Convergent Government Network over the next four

                        Central Bank of Oman (CBO) has eased its minimum capital

                        adequacy ratio to 10 per cent from 12 per cent. CBO is 
                        implementing the new international capital accord ‘Basel 
                        II’ from early next year. To implement Basel II in

                        ratio will be applicable after the implementation of 
                        Basel-II. In 1998, CBO had implemented minimum capital

                        The Omani economy will take advantage of high oil prices 
                        to reduce its debt by up to 30 per cent this year. Oman 
                        was using windfall revenue to reduce its debt, which 
                        amounted to US$2.6 billion. Oman’s internal debt stood 
                        at US$1.6 billion and its external debt was US$1.03 
                        billion. The 2006 state budget carries a gap of US$1.69 
                        billion but it is based on a conservative oil price of 
                        US$32 per barrel, about half the actual price. According 
                        to official statistics, Oman’s oil and gas exports 
                        soared 44.5 per cent to US$15.7 billion in 2005 over the 
                        previous year. The hydrocarbon sector accounts for 80 
                        per cent of the Sultanate’s export earnings and 40 per 
                        cent of its gross domestic product.</font></p>

General Manager of OHI Electronics, pastime is a paying business, as Mehre Alam 
discovers<br>
<br>
Did you ever hear of someone called DJ Devil? A Muscat-based “devil”! Ask the DJ 
buffs of the capital city. They’ll tell you who this “devil” is! He is someone 
called Devan Thuppali. In his free time, he is DJ Devil. In the office hours, he 
is the General Manager of OHI Electronics.<br>
<br>
“It’s a double-edged sword,” Thuppali says of his pastime, and laughs his heart 
out as we get started. He’s just back to the office. The 12 o’clock commitment 
is safe. So we begin the chat. <br>
<br>
What are his main hobbies? Need he spell it out any clearer? The penpusher 
insists. “My main hobby is music. Deejaying is my passion. I do a lot of shows 
in Oman — quite high profile shows, like for example the ABA Ball (the American 
British Academy Ball). I have been deejaying for this event for the last two 
years.” (For the uninitiated, DJ stands for disc jockey, an initial made famous 
by radio presenters who chose music compilations to be broadcast on the air; 
today they are better known off the air at live venues.).<br>
<br>
Thuppali is now a veteran of many a theme show like Valentine’s, Halloween and 
New Year’s Eve. And, he has deejayed at ‘A’ list private parties in the homes of 
Muscat’s elite.<br>
Necessity is the mother of invention, they say. Thuppali’s deejaying foray stems 
from this very premise. There was a time, he says, when he felt frustrated, 
unable to locate a suitable pub to take his family to. That’s when, and how, the 
deejay (DJ) in him was born. <br>
<br>
“We started mulling organising parties for like-minded people and families. 
There used to be this restaurant at the corniche called Al Inshirah. It 
specialised in Thai-Chinese cuisine,” Thuppali recalls. (“Tell me how long have 
you been here?” Thuppal suddenly pauses to test the reporter, and then goes on). 
“The restaurant had a huge party hall with wooden floor. It was ideal for 
parties. I started hosting theme parties for like-minded people with the help of 
Subroto, the then manager of the hotel. Thus began my foray into deejaying. And 
it went on like that for over three years.”<br>
<br>
Three years into deejaying and Thuppal started getting calls for professional 
performances. “Now, this is a paying hobby. It’s not just fun. I get paid. I get 
serious money for this,” he asserts. No wonder he went on to purchase some 
serious deejaying equipment. One look at the interiors of his house and you can 
spot the DJ in him — DJ Devil, to be more precise!<br>
<br>
As a DJ with a greying beard, how does he ward off competition from the younger 
lot? “I spend a lot of time downloading things, getting updated. When you are 
doing shows, you can’t keep playing old numbers. You’ve got to be up-to-date, 
especially in view of the kind of crowd you entertain today. Though I may look 
old, I play for a young crowd,” he emphasises. <br>
<br>
But there is more to Thuppal’s staying power. “Luckily for me, as far as DJs are 
concerned, I have come across a lot of Omani DJs,” he reveals. (Are you 
listening, expats?). “Strangely, the local DJs do not have a good mix. If you 
look at the crowd I have been playing for, you have the youngsters; you have 
those in the mid-30s, and those in the 40s and 50s. I tend to have a fantastic 
mix in the sense that I can satisfy everybody’s need in a crowd.”<br>
<br>
What about his other pastime? “I play a little bit of golf. My brush with golf 
started recently, thanks to the OER CEO Golf. This event was a kind of pedestal 
for me to get into the groove as far as golf is concerned. To be honest, I am 
quite regular with my golf now. I am there at the golf range almost every time I 
get a chance to play on the weekends (no tournaments because I do not have a 
handicap).”<br>
<br>
But how does he manage to eke out time to do all that. “It’s not all that 
difficult. It’s all about managing the 24 hours of a day properly. That’s it.” 
And he has a “memo” to give to the management mandarins: “Take your pastime 
seriously!” Point taken?</font></p>

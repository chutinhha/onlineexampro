Meet Omar Ahmed Qatan, the new CEO of Oman Oil Marketing Company, who believes 
innovation is the key to turn around corporate fortunes</b><br>

Ahmed Qatan has a clear formula when it comes to work ethic.</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
“Be fast and quick to work; exert the torque on time as the world will rotate 
faster than you if you don’t,” he says. Oman Oil Marketing Company (OOMCO) 
couldn’t have found a better person to step into the shoes of Michael G Wilson 
(ex Managing Director of OOMCO) to lead the company. Though it’s still early 
days for him — he took charge this April only — he has already shown that he 
practices what he believes in. “Soon after I joined, we signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MoU) with Yemen Petroleum to explore the development of a retail 
network there. In addition, I was in Southeast Asia recently to negotiate on a 
major project for the company. We are exploring more overseas markets quite 
aggressively. We expect to close some of these deals in the coming months,” Omar 
informs.<br>
<br>
Talking about his background, he says, “Being born into a business-oriented 
family, business is deep rooted in my blood. Even as a child in Grade III, I 
used to participate in the family business.” <br>
<br>
Omar graduated in civil engineering from California University in 1984. 
Thereafter, he went on to do his Master’s degree in public health from Leeds 
University (UK). He honed his professional skills by attending various training 
programmes and securing diplomas in projects and business management.<br>
<br>
He started his career with Royal Oman Police (ROP) as a civil engineer. 
Recounting his early days, he says, “I started by supervising ROP projects which 
gave me excellent exposure to being a professional manager with the focus on 
time management and stress for action rather than theory. Besides, values such 
as strict discipline, target orientation and performance got strongly embedded 
in my mind as a young Omani engineer working in the force. I spent 11 fruitful 
years with ROP, whilst moving up to managerial rank.” <br>
<br>
<b>Rich Experience<br>
</b><br>
With rich experience in supervision of projects executed by others behind him, 
Omar moved on to the other side of the table to execute projects himself as he 
joined Galfar Construction in 1996. “Starting as Senior Manager (Projects) 
dealing primarily with PDO projects, I moved on to head the branch in Yemen 
following which I was entrusted with the responsibility of executing a RO30 
million project for the Salalah Sewerage and Conveyor System. My five years at 
Galfar Construction taught me how to do a quality job with optimal utilization 
of resources to generate maximum profit. This stint broadened my skills and 
knowledge base as I worked in a highly competitive market to meet the 
international standards and ensure the highest levels of health, safety and 
environment (HSE) practices,” Omar spells out. <br>
<br>
His next assignment was with the industrial sector ending up with Gulf Stones 
Co. SAOG where he enhanced his reputation as a turnaround expert. According to 
him, the last few years at Gulf Stones were a unique experience. Those years 
added new dimensions to his professional understanding. “I drew up turnaround 
plans, appointed a new management team and conceptualized the new marketing 
strategy. All these efforts led to a complete transformation in the company’s 
fortunes. Within six months of my entry at the helm, the company posted a net 
profit after a gap of four years. When I left, the company was in a strong 
financial position with an excellent management team in place,” he recalls. <br>
<br>
<b>OOMCO Challenge<br>
</b><br>
What made him join OOMCO? “I accepted the offer as it was a challenging 
opportunity in a different industry where I could contribute to the growth of 
the company and also sharpen my own skills.” <br>
<br>
On his role as the CEO of the company, he says, “Simply put, my role as the CEO 
of OOMCO is to grow the company and the people. I am currently working closely 
with the senior management team to pave the way for taking the company to new 
growth standards, both organically and inorganically, and to excel in all we 
do.” <br>
He regards the team led by him as the custodians of the shareholders’ money. “We 
are initiating work on various projects to grow the company, get optimal 
utilization of resources, and maximise profits while delivering quality service 
to our customers and community,” he adds.<br>
<br>
Though he is still in the process of understanding the business and its 
intricacies, he has identified three challenging areas, which he must be 
prepared to manage in doing justice to his role as the CEO. “The first one is 
related to the continuity in supply of fuel products. We had recently seen 
restrictions being imposed on supply to all the marketing companies. This 
created a shortage in the Sultanate. Apart from restricting our ability to meet 
our customer’s requirement, this also led to higher operating costs. Hopefully, 
this is a thing of the past, with the government committing to sustain supplies 
to all marketing companies.<br>
<br>
“Secondly, we are committed to the national initiative of Omanisation. We have 
set ourselves a target of 90 per cent in the coming years. This is a challenge 
as it will have to be implemented in a manner that does not upset our ambitious 
growth plans.<br>
“Thirdly, aviation is another area of potential for us. We compete with regional 
airports and need to be competitive with them not only in terms of pricing but 
the overall offering also at the airport to grow the volumes at Seeb airport. We 
have been in dialogue with the concerned ministries/authorities to address this 
issue but a lot remains to be done on this front.”<br>
<br>
The economy of Oman is on a roll and most of the companies are generating record 
turnovers and profits. In this situation, the performance of a CEO is under 
constant pressure with the expectations from the shareholders and consumers to 
perform. Omar recognizes this fact as he says, “I believe that we should not 
just ‘meet’ expectations (that is the bare minimum) but should strive to surpass 
them or as I like to say ‘delight’ our shareholders/consumers. For that, we 
constantly need to innovate by thinking of new ways of doing things that would 
result in the ‘delight’. I believe innovation which results in ‘delight’ should 
be appropriately recognized and rewarded.”<br>

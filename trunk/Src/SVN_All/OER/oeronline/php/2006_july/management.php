point to the fluidity of capital as a driving force in the global markets. 
Capital respects no borders or nationalities. It flows wherever investment 
promises to deliver a handsome return. Human beings, unfortunately, float — and 
sometimes drown — in its wake. Ever since I began writing a book on human 
slavery in our own time, I have met some of those characters. Here’s one of 
those encounters.<br>
<br>
Not long ago I went to London and stayed in a hotel in the city center. One 
evening, I noticed that a member of the hotel staff who served me a cup of tea 
in the lobby was distraught. Her eyes betrayed a recent cry, and she was 
stumbling through her work. I asked after her well being, and she answered 
quickly, “Life is terrible, but I can’t talk about it.” I let her be.<br>
<br>
<b>Polish Story<br>
</b><br>
The next evening, as I was again relaxing in the lobby, Katja came over to my 
table to thank me for my concern the night before. She went on to share her 
remarkable story. Katja is from Poland and had been in London for only eight 
months. She had to leave Poland for her own safety. The local mafia had murdered 
her father because he would not cooperate with a corruption racket they were 
running in Warsaw. She knew the identity of the man who pulled the trigger 
because he continued to threaten her family after the murder. Katja bravely 
turned him into the police and a high-profile court case ensued. She 
subsequently appeared on television many times to denounce the stranglehold that 
criminals and corrupt police officers had on Polish society.<br>
<br>
Sadly, her efforts were like trying to slow a mighty stream with a single stone. 
Her father’s killer was found innocent, and the local mafia had her number. She 
fled to London and considers herself lucky to have found a job in an upscale 
hotel. Life is expensive in London, so Katja shares a flat with several other 
East European girls with whom she ekes out an existence.<br>
<br>
Due to her own hardship, Katja was not thrilled when her younger brother called 
her from Warsaw and said that he was going to join her in the UK. Katja warned 
him that opportunities were scarce in London for a Polish immigrant. “Don’t 
worry,” he said in an effort to soothe her anxiety. “I already have a job in a 
factory.” An advertisement in a Warsaw paper had promised good pay for Polish 
workers in Birmingham. A broker’s fee of US$500 and airfare were required, so 
her brother borrowed the money from their mother. He made the trip with a dozen 
other young Polish men.<br>
<br>
The “broker” picked the young men up at Heathrow and piled them in a van. They 
drove directly to Birmingham, and at nightfall, the broker dropped the whole 
crew off at a ramshackle house inside the city. He ordered them to be ready to 
be picked up in the morning for their first day of work. A bit dazed by the 
pace, they stretched out on the floor to sleep.<br>
<br>
Their rest was brief. In the wee hours of the night, the broker returned with a 
gang of 10 or so thugs armed with cricket bats. They beat the young Polish boys 
to a pulp and robbed them of all their valuables. Katja’s brother took some 
heavy kicks to the ribs and head, then stumbled out of the house. Once outside, 
he saw two police cars parked across the street. The officers in the cars 
obviously chose to ignore the mayhem playing out in front of their eyes. Katja’s 
brother knew better than try to convince them otherwise; the police in Poland 
would act no differently. Who knows, maybe they were part of the broker’s scam. 
Or maybe they just didn’t care about a bunch of poor Polish immigrants 
“invading” their town.<br>
<br>
<b>Human Trafficking<br>
</b><br>
The day I first saw Katja, she had just received a call from her frantic brother 
in Birmingham. In many ways, they were fortunate. </font></p>

                              Human trafficking thrives in the new global 
                              economy. People cross borders, are told by their 
                              “brokers” that they have to pay off their debt 
                              (for rent, food and transport from their host 
                              country) and end up serving for years as 
                              indentured slaves. The police and other local 
                              authorities often share in the revenue.</font></td>

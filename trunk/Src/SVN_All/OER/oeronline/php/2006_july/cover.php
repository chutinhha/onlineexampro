            property rights include patents (utility, design, and plant), 
            copyrights, and trademarks. A common definition of intellectual 
            property rights is the rights given to persons over the creations of 
            their minds.”<br>
            <br>
            With the signing of the US-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on 
            January 19 this year by HE Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, Oman’s Minister 
            of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Sultanate is on course to become a 
            special trading partner of the US. But before the FTA comes into 
            force, Oman is under compliance to set the house in order as per US 
            conditions. Under its FTA obligations (see box — US demands on IPR 
            regulations from Oman), Oman has committed to provide increased 
            intellectual property rights (IPR) protection for copyrights, 
            trademarks, geographical indications, and patents. Oman will also 
            improve enforcement and protection of undisclosed test data from 
            unfair commercial use.<br>
            <br>
            The US authorities are providing technical assistance to the Omani 
            government to change the prevailing IPR regulations. In January this 
            year, a regional IPR conference sponsored by US Patent Trademark 
            Office (PTO) was held in Muscat. More than 45 participants with 
            representation from the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, Office of 
            Public Prosecution, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Manpower and 
            Royal Oman Police attended the conference and gained knowledge on 
            IPR-related issues. In addition, US PTO is organising a series of 
            global IP enforcement academies in the US to create awareness about 
            IPRs.<br>
            <br>
            “Last year, we organised the academies in December. This year, we 
            organised the academies in February, May and June. Many Omani 
            representatives participated in it. The next one is scheduled in 
            August. The attendees meet the IPR experts in US PTO and US Trade 
            Representative headquarters besides having an audience with 
            corporates to gain from their experiences in dealing with IPR,” 
            informed an official from the US embassy in Oman. <br>
            <br>
            The Omani authorities are working with World Intellectual Property 
            Rights Organization in developing and drafting the new legislation. 
            Once the legislation is ready, they are expected to share it with US 
            Trade Representatives and US PTO to check its compliance with the 
            FTA.</font></p>

            </b><br>
            Like 
            seen in many markets across the world, the major cases related to 
            IPR violations here pertain to software piracy, music and movie 
            piracy, counterfeit branded FMCG, stealing of satellite channels’ 
            signals, auto ancillaries, pharmaceuticals etc. According to Yahya 
            bin Issa Al-Riami, Director, Intellectual Property Department, 
            Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry: “The most prominent issue is the 
            imitation of trademarks which confuses the consumer and makes it 
            difficult for him to identify the difference between the original 
            and imitated product.  </font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">The private sector has major concerns due to business loss on 
            account of their IPR violations. Pankaj K Khimji, Partner, Khimji 
            Ramdas Group said, “There are challenges on the IPR front. We have 
            concerns in beauty care products, especially shampoo line. As per 
            our estimates, almost 30-35 per cent of what is sold in the market 
            is counterfeit. Unfortunately, very little can be done because there 
            is the issue of how do you know that it is counterfeit. Because the 
            difference between the real and the counterfeit could be determined 
            by an expert only. It’s not like Rolex watch which you can open and 
            identify the difference easily. With the help of the bottlemaking 
            die and sticker, the fake packaging will look similar to the 
            original pack.”<br>
            <br>
            Khimji added, “For large MNCs, Oman as a market is a drop in the 
            ocean, but we, as hard burned traders, feel the heat. MNCs focus on 
            the manufacturers of counterfeits instead of the sellers.”<br>
            <br>
            The consumer is affected by IPR violation. His or her expectations 
            of the product are not met, he is at risk as counterfeit 
            manufacturers do not follow the same safety and quality standards as 
            the original manufacturers. Charles Schofield of Trowers &amp; Hamlins 
            says: “The consumers might not get the products or services as the 
            foreign companies might not introduce their products or services due 
            to a country’s poor IPR protection.”<br>
            <br>
            But the situation is changing fast. Jawad Al-Redha, Co-Chairman of 
            Business Software Alliance (BSA) Middle East said: “Dealers are 
            co-operating with BSA and are showing their commitment by signing 
            the Code of Ethics drafted by BSA to protect copyrighted software. 
            Forty Omani companies have signed the BSA Code of Ethics since 
            October 2003. The Code of Ethics declares that the signatories would 
            neither commit nor tolerate the manufacture, use, or distribution of 
            unlicensed software and would supply only licensed software to 
            customers.” <br>
            BSA is an international organisation committed to protecting the 
            rights and interests of software developers and providing a safe 
            e-commerce environment.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Issues in IPR Implementation in Oman<br>
            </b><br>
            One 
            of the major complaints against IPR Laws is the laxity towards 
            giving harsher punishment to the guilty. For example, if someone is 
            caught violating a copyright law, he/she will be sentenced to jail 
            for not more than two years and a fine of not more then RO2000. 
            Besides, all the duplicate products will be confiscated along with 
            the articles used to make the illegal duplication. Perhaps, it’s not 
            a harsh deterrent for the regular offenders.<br>
            <br>
            According to Schofield, the greatest challenge is the enforcement of 
            the law. “Internationally, the mechanisms are in place with a strong 
            judicial system which has the ability to provide urgent relief like 
            quick injunctions. The affected people based on those injunctions 
            can take action themselves against those who are breaching their 
            IPRs. Self-help is the norm everywhere but the mechanism needs to be 
            in place to facilitate the process,” he said. </font></p>

            the government authorities don’t want to use IPR-related laws 
            harshly on the people because the public at large is new to the IPR 
            development and is not used to it. There is another problem under 
            the law, which relates to evidence. It is difficult to prove that 
            someone is infringing on the copyrights. The court wants the 
            official evidence of the infringement.<br>
            <br>
            “Another related and notable issue is that the police are not fully 
            equipped to understand the crime. They refuse to file the case 
            unless we approach the public prosecution and the public prosecution 
            asks us to submit an explanation of why a particular development, 
            like using a computer programme illegally, is a crime. It’s 
            difficult to get the protection despite the law being in place. 
            Lastly, the issue is left for the ordinary commercial court to 
            solve. This is an area of concern. May be, IP specialist judges 
            would be a better option,” Sheridan said.</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">Sheridan’s 
            colleague at Denton Wilde Sapte, Dianne Hamilton, who has recently 
            moved to Oman from Australia, has a fresh perspective on the subject 
            as she said: “The IPR laws in Oman are there but the exemptions 
            under them are too wide. For example, educational institutions can 
            use any part of scientific copyright work or even all of it. So the 
            person who made the effort of creating the intellectual property 
            loses out instantly. It also means that the educational institutions 
            can use IP work like Micosoft programmes. That’s extraordinary, as 
            one has to pay for using the same software in other places. 
            Similarly, entire content reproduction by broadcasters and 
            newspapers are allowed related to economic and religious articles 
            besides news on current topics. The wideness of the permissible 
            usage is too much. To protect IPR in the country, this kind of 
            exemptions need to be looked into. In Australia, the copyright laws 
            are quite extensively written but here, it is summarised in a few 
            pages without getting into complete details.”<br>
            <br>
            There is another issue that must be dealt with. Otherwise, it might 
            grow into a major problem for the government as the country 
            progresses in the coming years. “Under the copyright law, one has to 
            deposit the intellectual property physically with the ministry to 
            get a copyright. How are the authorities going to handle situations 
            like TV channels, radio stations and movies beaming copyrighted 
            programming round-the-clock later on?” asked Abdelrahman Mohamed 
            Elnafie of Denton Wilde Sapte. <br>
            <b><br>
            Fear Among MNCs<br>
            </b><br>
            Already, some MNCs have raised their apprehensions about the 
            protection of their intellectual properties in Oman. With the 
            US-Oman FTA, MNCs based out of the US are going to be more vocal and 
            aggressive in giving vent to their fears. <br>

            One major area of concern, according to Sheridan, is knowledge 
            transfer. He said: “At times what happens is that a local company 
            ties up with an MNC to make and/or sell their products/services 
            under the trademark of that MNC. But after the expiry of the 
            contract between the two, the local company goes on its own by 
            introducing its own brand/ product with high degree of similarity 
            with the MNC brand that it was dealing with earlier. The MNC company 
            then sues the local company. As a result, many MNCs get wary of 
            giving their technical know-how to the local company due to the fear 
            of duplication later on.”<br>
            <br>
            Agriculture too is not immune to IPR violations. Terence Shelby, 
            Deputy General Manager, Tawoos Agricultural Systems LLC informed: 
            “We source seeds, fertilizers, chemicals etc. from the vendor and 
            the agreement is based purely on trust and faith. It’s a gentleman 
            verbal agreement presuming that we are supplied with products on 
            which they have rightful ownership. The margins in agriculture are 
            very small. It is quite possible that in the process to increase 
            their margins some of the companies might cut corners by resorting 
            to cheaper inputs and in the process violate IPRs without even 
            knowing about it.”<br>
            <br>
            More than anything else, MNCs look forward to maintaining 
            confidentiality and business secrets with the comfort of approaching 
            a court to get relief at a faster pace in the case of IP violation. 
            They are worried about the availability of instant remedy for 
            enforcement of their rights.<br>
            <br>
            In a major initiative to fight illicit replication of genuine goods 
            and to help enforce Intellectual Property Rights, some of the 
            renowned international brands have joined hands to launch the Brand 
            Owners Protection Group (BPG) for the GCC and Yemen, based in Dubai.<br>
            <br>
            Some of the most reputed global brands that have joined hands to 
            establish the BPG include Beiersdorf, British American Tobacco, 
            DaimlerChrysler, General Motors, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nestle, 
            Phillips, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Unilever.<br>
            <br>
            ‘These market leaders are alarmed at the economic, social, and moral 
            impact that illicit trade has on consumers, governments, and 
            legitimate businesses. The BPG has been founded in order to suggest 
            and recommend effective measures to counter this social menace,” 
            added Omar Shteiwi, Chairman of the Board of the BPG and Regional 
            Intellectual Property Advisor, Nestle Middle East.<br>

            <b>Losses Due to Piracy <br>
            </b><br>
            As 
            per estimates, global counterfeiting currently represents between 
            7-10 per cent of world trade. Crimes ranging from counterfeiting, 
            cloning and unauthorized association to diversion, tampering and 
            theft are costing brand owners anywhere between US$350-600 billion 
            per annum through loss of sales, legal action and erosion of brand 
            loyalty and trust.</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">China, the global factory, leads in terms of IPR infringement as 
            counterfeit goods now account for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per 
            cent of all products manufactured in China, said Representative 
            Donald Manzullo, chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, 
            US. About 95 per cent of all compact discs (CDs) and digital 
            versatile discs (DVDs) manufactured in China are counterfeit. The 
            Chinese counterfeit production is affecting the US economy badly. 
            “In 2005, almost 70 per cent of counterfeit products seized at US 
            borders originated in China. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, auto 
            parts, aircraft engine parts and other advanced industrial products 
            are now experiencing the same incursions that are already familiar 
            to content providers and artists. With an annual exchange of goods 
            worth over US$285 billion, this creates a bilateral trade issue of 
            the utmost importance between the US and China,” he said. <br>
            <br>
            US auto parts producers estimate that they are losing US$12 billion 
            per year because of counterfeiting. The US Federal Trade Commission 
            has determined that domestic corporations in the automobile industry 
            could hire another 250,000 American workers if sales of counterfeit 
            parts were eliminated. No wonder US authorities are aggressively 
            lobbying for curbing piracy and enforcing IPR laws in most of the 
            countries to protect its own interests.<br>
            <br>
            In terms of software piracy rate, the Middle East dropped one 
            percentage point last year to 57 per cent, while the global piracy 
            rate has remained unchanged at 35 per cent, according to an 
            independent study released by BSA. The UAE’s piracy level of 34 per 
            cent is lower than that of several European countries, such as 
            France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, and is 
            comparable to the piracy rates of the United Kingdom (27 per cent), 
            the Netherlands (30 per cent), Australia (31 per cent), Qatar (60 
            per cent), Oman (62 per cent) and Kuwait (66 per cent). Saudi Arabia 
            remained unchanged at 52 per cent. The total loss due to software 
            piracy in the Middle East and Africa region stood at US$1.6 billion. 
            As per estimates, 35 per cent of the packaged software installed on 
            personal computers worldwide in 2005 was illegal, amounting to US$34 
            billion in global losses due to software piracy.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Benefits of IPR Protection<br>
            </b><br>
            A US embassy official opined, “The companies from the 
            US, Oman and other countries are going to benefit alike from 
            stricter IPR norms and enforcement in the Sultanate. It is not going 
            to benefit just the US companies alone. If Oman is serious about 
            building a knowledge-based economy, and if it wants to improve on 
            research and development activities, it has to improve on IPR 
            performance. Otherwise, knowledge/technology transfer and foreign 
            investment will not happen here, because companies will be wary of 
            enforcement of their IPRs. The FTA commitment will open for Oman, a 
            country of 2.5 million people, a duty free access to US market of 
            290 million people. That’s a good deal for Oman. FTA is a special 
            club. Jordan, which joined the US FTA club a few years ago, is a 
            good example. In 2000, the trade between US-Jordan was around US$200 
            million and now it is over US$1.1 billion. The software industry, 
            which was almost non-existent in Jordan earlier, is now a booming 
            industry after the FTA.”</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">A BSA-IDC study illustrates economic gains from reducing software 
            piracy. Reducing the worldwide piracy rate by 10 percentage points 
            could create 2.4 million jobs - US$400 billion in economic growth. 
            In China, the IT sector is projected to grow by 85 per cent by 2009 
            despite a software piracy rate of 90 per cent. However, a 10-point 
            piracy reduction could increase China’s IT growth to 209 per cent - 
            a 124 per cent differential. Curbing piracy and adoption of 
            legitimate software leads to expansion of software companies’ 
            business across countries which generates more jobs.<br>
            <br>
            The IT sector in the Middle East &amp; Africa is a small but a growing 
            US$17 billion industry, with 32,000 businesses employing more than 
            220,000 people and generating US$6.6 billion a year in taxes. With a 
            10-point reduction in its 58 per cent software piracy rate, the 
            region’s IT sector could grow to US$27.5 billion by 2009, adding 
            almost 95,000 new jobs and US$5.4 billion in additional economic 
            growth.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Arguments Against IPR<br>
            </b><br>
            There are counter arguments, which contend that better IPR leads to 
            faster economic growth and higher FDI. In the 1970s, as many 
            developing countries were not technologically at the forefront, the 
            incentives provided by IPR, and patents in particular, for 
            investment in research and development, were not meaningful. IPR was 
            considered as ‘protection for monopoly imports’ of benefit to 
            exporters at the expense of developing country importers.<br>
            <br>
            The world has changed quite drastically in the last few decades. But 
            many countries remain in a position where they are the buyers, 
            rather than producers of key products and technologies. For these 
            nations, enhanced IPR will lead to increased imports and higher 
            prices in some sectors. The domestic benefits of stronger IPRs are 
            less clearly established. Past justifications of stronger IPR as 
            being an important ‘signal’ of openness to economic activities or 
            theoretical justifications of the roles of IPR have been useful but 
            not compelling for those who are seeking some clearly documented 
            evidence.<br>
            There is no clear presumption that stronger rights will always 
            enhance welfare e.g., for small countries (those whose R&amp;D 
            expenditures do not registered globally), stronger IPR increases 
            welfare by enhancing access to products not otherwise available. 
            Over-protection in countries with limited R&amp;D capacity, reduces 
            local production of ‘pirate’ products, and can lead to reduced 
            benefits due to higher prices and job losses. But if the small 
            country has both production and innovation capacity, welfare results 
            are indeterminate. <br>
            <br>
            As Thorstein Veblen, Norwegian-American economist and sociologist, 
            said, “Ownership gives the owner not only the right of use over the 
            community’s immaterial equipment, but also the right of abuse and of 
            neglect and inhibition.” <br>
            <br>
            When use of existing work is restricted, society may be hurt. As 
            intellectual objects are public goods, granting a (temporary) 
            monopoly on their commercial exploitation may not leave “enough and 
            as good.”<br>
            <br>
            Independent inventors are hurt as they may be prohibited from using 
            something they have developed themselves but another party was 
            granted a patent for earlier. It is further argued that intellectual 
            objects are more often than physical ones, the result of cooperation 
            - a cooperation that may or may not be promoted by IPRs<br>
            <br>
            It is becoming increasingly difficult for developing countries to 
            ignore IPR policies. Only when a country has a sufficiently 
            attractive internal market and/or has a sufficiently strong research 
            tradition itself will it be able to negotiate on an equal footing. 
            China, India, and Brazil are examples of countries that are able to 
            credibly use the threat of drawing on the compulsory license clause 
            in Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) to 
            make right holders lower the price of the products they offer. If a 
            country offers protection of IPRs that is perceived as too weak, FDI 
            might suffer and exports of products that embody new technology 
            might be lower too, for fear of such products being re- imported.<br>
            <br>
            Developed economies like the US have been haphazard in implementing 
            and enforcing IPRs when they were not yet so relatively developed 
            themselves. Had Japan done so with regard to patents, it might not 
            have had its strong electronics industry. Had the USA done so with 
            regard to copyrights, it might not have had its strength in the 
            entertainment industry that it now has. <br>
            <br>
            To prevent the system of IPRs from being hijacked by larger firms, 
            standards for obtaining patents should be raised; and made sure that 
            incentives to initial inventors are more clearly and evenly weighed 
            “against incentives for follow-on innovators”. Narrowing the scope 
            of patents is one option; shortening the duration of (some) patents 
            is another. Differentiating between patents covering different areas 
            has also been suggested by Bill Gates of Microsoft. <br>
            <br>
            In the case of Oman, the new IPR regulation is round the corner as 
            to quote a senior US government official: “It is like taking the pen 
            to the paper.” It will be interesting to see how the US FTA will 
            work for Oman. The other Middle Eastern nations are keeping a close 
            tab on the developments, as they are next in queue to join the 
            special US FTA club.</font></p>

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Oman’s tryst with IPR started with the Sultanate passing a 
                  Trademark Law in 1987, leading to registrations of trademarks 
                  in the official Gazette. There was no patent or copyright 
                  protection at that time. A US IPR delegation visited Oman in 
                  May 1992. During the talks, Omani officials tentatively 
                  acknowledged the need to draft patent and copyright laws and 
                  expressed an interest in examining the process. The Sultanate 
                  agreed to join the World Intellectual Property Organization in 
                  September 1996. Thereafter, in 2000, the Sultanate joined the 
                  World Trade Organization (WTO) and signed an agreement on the 
                  protection of intellectual property rights. <br>
                  <br>
                  As part of its WTO accession, Oman introduced amendments to 
                  the GCC patent law to comply with its obligations under the 
                  Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) 
                  Agreement. In 2000, Oman amended its copyright protection law, 
                  and in 1999, enacted decrees banning the local sale of pirated 
                  video cassettes, sound recordings, and computer software.<br>
                  <br>
                  Currently, the laws related to IPR in Oman include: <br>
                  1) Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Law (Royal Decree No. 
                  37/2000)<br>
                  2) Trademarks, Descriptions and Secrets and Protection from 
                  Unfair Competition Law (Royal Decree No. 38/2000)<br>
                  3) Protection of Industrial Designs Law (Royal Decree No. 
                  39/2000)<br>
                  4) Protection of Geographical Indications Law (Royal Decree 
                  No. 40/2000)<br>
                  5) The Topographies Rights of Integrated Circuits (Royal 
                  Decree No. 41/2000) <br>

                  On the changes expected soon, Yahya Bin Issa Al-Riami, 
                  Director, Intellectual Property Department, Ministry of 
                  Commerce &amp; Industry informed, “Currently, Protection of 
                  Industrial Designs Law (Royal Decree No. 39/2000) is under 
                  revision. Besides that, an executive draft of the law is being 
                  made in association with WIPO. The law will be announced after 
                  the review and approval by WIPO and subsequently, the Ministry 
                  of Commerce and Industry and Ministry of Juctice.”<br>
                  <br>
                  He added, “Currently, 80 per cent of registered trademarks in 
                  the Sultanate are owned by companies from other countries, 
                  while 20 per cent of total registered trademarks are owned by 
                  Omani companies.”</font></td>

            <br>
            </b>If you observe the mineral water bottle and relate it to IPR 
            laws, you will find that this product is related to five IPR laws 
            which are illustrated in the following example: <br>

            innovation is called invention and it re-acquires a Patent. <br>
            <br>
            Then, designing the bottle in attractive way goes under Industrial

                T</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">wo of Europe’s biggest telecommunications companies, Nokia 
                and Siemens, have announced their intention to join forces. The 
                new company, named Nokia Siemens Networks, will have about 
                US$19.9 billion in annual sales and will be based in Finland. 
                Nokia is located at Espoo, Finland, while Siemens is based in 
                Munich. The combined entity will have around a 21 per cent share 
                in the wireless-equipment market.<br>
                <br>
                The companies say that they will eliminate around 9,000 jobs — 
                15 per cent of their combined workforce — with the aim of 
                mounting a challenge against market leader Ericsson AB, which 
                has a 26 per cent share of the market. Siemens had been 
                searching for years for a solution for its telecom equipment 
                unit “Com”, after offloading its loss-making mobile phones 
                division to Taiwan’s BenQ last year. Nokia and Siemens said they 
                both expect to boost their earnings per share by the end of 2007 
                on a pro-forma basis excluding restructuring charges.<br>
                <br>
                The European Commission is generally supportive of the agreement 
                between the two companies. In an interview, the EU’s 
                telecommunications commissioner Viviane Reding said the merger 
                would be viewed as an opportunity to create a stronger player 
                and enhance competition: “When there are mergers that help the 
                market to be competitive, which is a very good move.”</font></p>

                <b>Arcelor accepts Mittal takeover bid<br>
                </b><br>
                <img border="1" src="worldscan_arcelor.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="114">Arcelor 
                SA ended a bitter five-month takeover battle by yielding to a 
                sweetened bid from Mittal Steel Co. The combination will create 
                a titan with nearly 10 per cent of the global steelmaking 
                market. Arcelor’s board supported the proposal to create 
                Arcelor-Mittal after Mittal boosted its offer 7 per cent to 
                about US$33 billion. Since Mittal launched a surprise bid in 
                January this year, Arcelor had wrung several changes out of the 
                company, retaining a considerable level of control. <br>
                <br>
                Analysts have said the two companies are complementary and have 
                few overlaps. Arcelor — based in Europe with large operations in 
                Latin America — focuses on high-quality steel, selling to 
                long-term clients in the auto industry in Europe. 
                Rotterdam-based Mittal’s steel mills in Asia and Eastern Europe 
                produce lower-quality steel sold on the open market, although it 
                also has significant operations in North America.<br>
                <br>
                Under the terms of the deal, Mittal will pay US$50.51 a share in 
                cash and stock, a 49 per cent improvement on Mittal’s first 
                unsolicited offer on January 27. The Mittal family, which 
                currently holds 87 per cent of Mittal Steel, will own 43.6 per 
                cent of the combined group and agreed not to make any major 
                changes to their stake for five years. The new company would 
                dwarf other steel makers, controlling close to 10 per cent of 
                world steel production, churning out 120 million tons of crude 
                steel a year and employing more than 320,000 people. It would 
                have a market capitalization of US$46 billion and save US$1.6 
                billion in synergies.</font></p>

                The world’s biggest food company well known for its chocolate 
                and coffee has embarked on a new push to tackle obesity and 
                diabetes. At the company’s research laboratory in Switzerland, 
                scientists are working on new projects that alter the body’s 
                absorption of sugar, reduce fatty acids in the bloodstream and 
                set up the burning of carbohydrates during digestion. The first 
                of these offering a cereal bar with a fiber addictive that tamps 
                down surge in blood sugar levels after eating, was launched in 
                Asia last year and will soon be rolled out worldwide. More 
                engineered foods are on the horizon. Nestle is studying 
                acetogenic fibers, found in apples and some vegetables that may 
                reduce high level of fatty acids in the bloodstream.</font></p>

                <b>Future without Gates</b><br>
                <br>
                Microsoft is mapping plans for a future without visionary Bill 
                Gates as the world’s biggest software giant gears for battle 
                with Google and others to be the dominant high-technology 
                company. Bill Gates, who founded Microsoft with his childhood 
                friend Paul Allen, has announced he will step down from his 
                day-to-day duties at the company in 2008 so that he can devote 
                more time to philanthropy. Gates will retain the title of 
                chairman of the group he founded over 30 years ago, while 
                handing over his title of “chief software architect” to Ray 
                Ozzie, another software industry pioneer.<br>
                <br>
                According to analyst group Gartner, Microsoft is facing one of 
                its greatest challenges yet. “Recent trends such as Web 2.0, 
                software as a service and open source software are increasingly 
                threatening the company’s pre-eminence within the IT industry. 
                Google represents the most obvious challenge.”<br>
                <br>
                The response to this challenge will be led by chief technology 
                officer Craig Mundie, who will take on Gates’ research and 
                strategy responsibilities, and Ray Ozzie, who will become chief 
                software architect. <br>
                <br>
                Commenting on the change, George Kalorkoti, group chief 
                information officer at solicitors Herbert Smith, said, 
                “Microsoft is at the stage in its evolution where a fresh set of 
                directions, in response to the business challenges it faces from 
                the likes of Google, Linux and the EU (competition issues), is 
                going to benefit it and its customers.”</font></p>

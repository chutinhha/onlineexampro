Singh, Partner, Ernst &amp; Young, writes on how the concept of public private 
partnerships is bringing about a paradigm shift in the Gulf<br>
<br>
Public Private Partnerships (PPP) have, in recent times, revolutionised the way 
the public sector operates. Instead of the public sector procuring a capital 
asset by paying for it in full upfront, the effect of a typical PPP structure is 
usually to create a single standalone business, financed and operated by the 
private sector. The purpose is to create the asset and then deliver the service 
to the public sector client, in return for payment commensurate with the service 
levels provided.<br>
<br>
<b>There are two key objectives in commissioning a PPP:</b><br>
• The first is to maximize value for money in providing a service over a long 
timescale of 20 to 30 years, having taken account of all the risks. Maximizing 
efficiency and innovation is key to achieving value for money.<br>
• The second is to enable the public sector to procure services in a manner 
consistent with economic policy.<br>
<br>
In order to meet these objectives, the public sector considers a number of key 
criteria, like for example: What is the need and what is the optimal solution to 
meeting that need? Does the private sector have the capability to meet that 
need? Can PPP demonstrate value for money? Can the PPP solution be afforded?<br>
<br>
The key is to focus on what service is required, which means specifying the 
output, and allowing the private sector to determine what inputs are required, 
including infrastructure and skills, with a view to achieving that specified 
output.<br>
<br>
Why PPP? There are a number of factors relating to public sector cash 
constraints and the underlying principles of PPP, which might cause governments 
to consider the introduction of a PPP:<br>
<b><br>
Public Sector Cash Constraints</b><br>
In many countries, the demand for new infrastructure projects is growing in 
quality and quantity. Besides, there is the rising pressure for funds to renew, 
maintain and operate the existing infrastructure. Competition for such funding 
is often intense, not just between infrastructure projects, but also with the 
many other demands on public sector
finance. PPP permits the authorities to substantially reduce capital expenditure 
and convert the infrastructure costs into affordable operating expenditure 
spread over an appropriate timescale.<br>
<br>
<b>Principles of PPP<br>
</b><br>
PPP allows each partner (public/private) to concentrate on activities that best 
suit their respective skills. For the public sector, the key skill lies in 
developing policies on service needs and requirements. For the private sector, 
the key is to deliver those services at the most efficient cost. The nature of 
the PPP process may help to address any historical shortcomings in public sector 
procurement management in the following ways:<br>
<br>
• Procurement Efficiency: Meeting monetary and time budgets, which are 
frequently overrun in conventional procurement contracts.<br>
• Improved Accountability: Proper consideration of the long-term ongoing 
liabilities that arise, avoiding the possibility of short-term policy decisions 
taken solely on a cash accounting basis.<br>
• Risk Management: Assessment of risk allows projects to proceed with a full 
range of risks being fully accounted for and priced into the procurement 
contract. Public officials are generally not trained, measured or rewarded for 
taking such risks.<br>
<br>
<b>Benefits of PPP</b><br>
<br>
<b>- Strengthening of infrastructure: </b>PPP can help enhance the quality and 
quantity of basic infrastructure such as water, energy supply, 
telecommunications and transport as well as being widely applied to other public 
services such as hospitals, schools and prisons.<br>
<br>
<b>- Value for money:</b> PPP projects can often deliver greater value for money 
compared with that of an equivalent asset procured conventionally. This is 
because the synergies developed by combining design, construction and operation 
outweigh the higher cost of finance. The fact that those responsible for the 
building of an asset are also responsible for long-term maintenance and 
operation, should ensure that whole life costings are properly assessed.<br>
<br>
<b>- New facilities provided efficiently and effectively: </b>Because the 
private sector will usually not receive any payment until the facility is 
available for use, the PPP contract structure fosters the use of construction 
and procurement methods that encourage efficient completion and minimise the 
risk of defects.<br>
<br>
<b>- Innovation and spread of best practice:</b> The expertise and experience of 
the private sector encourages innovation, resulting in reduced costs, shorter 
delivery times and improvement in the design, construction and facility 
management processes. Developments in these processes can be applied to future 
projects, facilitating the spread of best practice within public services.<br>
<br>
<b>- Standards maintained: </b>Assets and services will be maintained at a 
pre-determined standard over the full length of the concession. This may 
contrast with conventional public procurement where maintenance of assets and 
service quality are dependent on the public sector continuously making funds 
available to maintain the asset and service.<br>
o Flexibility: PPP has the inbuilt flexibility to be introduced successfully to 
most types of infrastructure, and the principles that underpin PPP can be 
adapted to any situation.<br>
<br>
<b>- Local employment: </b>Where buildings and services are delivered which 
would not otherwise be available, new employment opportunities are generated. 
Such PPP projects are also helping support local businesses and promote 
long-term relationships in the local economy. <br>
<br>
<b>Ground Reality<br>
</b><br>
Oman has gained significant PPP experience through its Independent Water and 
Power Project (IWPP) programme over the past few years. This has been a 
successful program that has allowed the Government to set up five power projects 
generating almost 1,800 MW of power and about 50 MIGD of desal water; it is also 
in the process of launching two more power projects of 600 MW power and 30 MIGD 
of desal water.<br>
<br>
It appears that this program will now lead to IWPP programs too. In a 
path-breaking venture, the Ministry of Defence is in the process of finalizing a 
Military Technological College to provide a specialized education program under 
a PPP framework, together with facilities management. Going forward, one expects 
that this PPP framework has great potential in the areas of Education (specially 
higher education), Housing (and the focus here could be on social housing), and 
Transport (roads).<br>
<br>
These trends generally hold true for the GCC, where power has always been the 
first sector to be tested for the PPP model. Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Riyadh, and 
Kuwait, all seem to have adopted the IWPP model for their power sectors. <br>
<br>
In other cases, Kuwait is piloting its PPP approach with a social housing 
project, while Bahrain is also about to appoint advisors for a social housing 
project under PPP. Abu Dhabi has recently made headway in Education with 30 odd 
public schools being handed over to the private sector for managing on a PPP 
basis. Riyadh too is keen to make a significant commitment on PPP for its water 
distribution and transmission sector.<br>
<br>
Apart from these specific examples, the GCC Governments are keen to consider a 
number of other projects in the areas of infrastructure and real estate under 
PPP models. <br>
<br>
Clearly, the next few years offer very interesting opportunities for the private 
sector to enter into partnerships with their Governments.<br>

<b>OER reviews what makes Omani crude oil so competitive in the international 
market</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="pdo.jpg" width="350" height="166" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">1967 
- On July 27, the Mosprince – a 83,000-tonne tanker built only the previous year 
in Japan for the Mosvold Shipping Company of Norway – arrived off the coast of 
the Sultanate of Oman to load a cargo of crude oil. According to the bill of 
lading dated August 8, 1967, the cargo consisted of 543,800 barrels of net clean 
oil of API* gravity 33.2 degrees, valued at US$1.42 a barrel. Distinguishing 
that oil was not its volume, purity, density or price, but its provenance, for 
it was the first oil ever exported from Oman. <br>
<br>
Four decades have passed since. Omani crude oil continues to command great 
demand in the international market (see graph – Oman Crude Export Destinations 
2006). But it has not always been easy to meet the demand particularly in recent 
years. John Malcolm, PDO managing director, explains: “We produce from 3,750 
wells in 120 fields, operate 16,000 km of pipelines and run numerous 
oil-processing plants. Last year, we contracted 36 drilling rigs to sink 249 
wells. That is more new wells drilled than by any other Middle East national oil 
company. And there are literally many more layers of complexity under the 
surface: Oman’s geology is exceptionally complex.”</font><p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

		<b>Production process<br>
		<img border="0" src="special_report_pdo02.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>Oil is forced to the surface using the natural pressures 
		underground, through pumps on the surface or submerged in the well, and 
		also by injecting water or gas to artificially increase pressure in the 
		reservoir. Often what comes to the surface is a mixture of oil, water 
		and gas, and this is collected and separated in oil production stations. 
		The water is either used for re-injection into the field or disposed of, 
		while the gas is a valuable commodity in its own right, and is mostly 
		transported away for sale unless it is needed for injection into the 
		reservoir. Once the water and gas have been removed, the remaining crude 
		oil is pumped from the production station into pipelines for 
		transportation and commingling in the main oil line. The main oil line 
		is the backbone of Oman’s oil production, stretching 1,600 km from 
		Marmul in the south to Muscat in the north. The resulting mixture – 
		known as Oman Export Blend Crude – is collected at PDO’s Mina al Fahal 
		terminal. The terminal has 10 storage tanks with a capacity of nearly 
		five million barrels and three single-buoy mooring units, through which 
		the tankers receive their liquid cargo.<br>
		<br>
		Mina al Fahal bay is one of the region’s few deepwater ports for oil 
		tankers, so the ships usually arrive partly filled, then top up with 
		Omani crude before setting off for their final destinations. The 
		remainder of Oman’s oil meets the needs of the domestic market, for 
		which its final destination are the refineries at Mina Al Fahal or 
		Sohar. At the refinery, crude oil is turned into gasoline and fuel oil. 
		Refined oil is also used as the base material for plastics and 
		chemicals. Nothing is wasted – even the heavy residue from refining is 
		used as bitumen, which gives a solid foundation to the roads we drive 
		on.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
		<font size="1" face="Verdana"><b><br>
		Quality standards<br>
		</b>The Omani government’s policy is to ensure that the oil has a minimum 
		average API of 34 degrees. In addition, before the oil is loaded onto 
		tankers, it must meet certain other technical specifications with 
		respect to its acidity and its water, salt and sulphur content. Crude 
		oil is commercially defined as “sweet”, if the total sulphur content is 
		0.5 per cent or less by weight and “sour**” if this is more. Oman crude 
		is classified as sour oil.<br>
		<br>
		PDO and the other oil producers in Oman, all of whom put their oil into 
		PDO’s main oil line, ensure that their contributions meet agreed quality 
		specifications. The quality and quantity at each input mode is measured 
		and the data are transmitted in “real time” to PDO.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>*API gravity: An arbitrary scale of degrees, named after the American 
		Petroleum Institute, by which a crude oil’s specific gravity (its 
		density relative to water) is measured. The larger the API degree, the 
		lighter the oil and the higher its value.</i><br>
		<i><br>
		**Sour Crude: Crude oil containing more than 2.5 per cent sulphur (by 
		weight).<br>

<b>The new Touareg is something that will be with you all the way, from the 
narrow corners of the city to the rugged open spaces of the interiors<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="car1.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The concept of SUV or Sports Utility Vehicle 
became popular due to it being roomier and more comfortable without taking away 
from performance. This SUV idea consists of a blend of practicality and 
performance, which is really brought out in the Touareg. <br>
<br>
<b>What’s New</b><br>
The new Touareg at first glance appears to be an extension of the old one but 
there are a few significant changes. The most important being the introduction 
of the FSI injection technology in all its petrol engines This has led to an 
increase of 40hp in both the 3.2L V6 and the 4.2L V8 engines (giving a total of 
280hp and 350hp, respectively).<br>
<br>
There has been an addition of curves to the headlights along with slight changes 
to the brake lamps, which indeed complement the vehicle. These changes were 
particularly welcome since the old models had been fairly plain and 
unfortunately, a bit too simple for such a refined machine.<br>
<br>
<b>Driving Impression<br>
</b>We drove the 3.2L V6 for this test. Our expectations of a V6 were more than 
met on our first drive. On road, the V6 showed impressive power. It’s power band 
continued at speeds much after 120kmph, which is usually the characteristic of 
V8s. The summary of the acceleration over a long stretch would be: “smooth and 
consistent”. In turns, the Touareg took on a different form. The suspension 
overall gave a very soft and smooth response. This, however, may take some 
getting used to, as the car has way more control than what appears to be. The 
gearbox comes in 6 speed tiptronic. The tiptronic performed well in full 
acceleration, but the initial gear shift is slow for spontaneous reactions. 
Considering the size of the Touareg, this fact can be easily looked over. The 
option of the sports mode is great. It runs completely in automatic, while 
keeping the car considerably in a lower gear. This low gear driving assists 
speedy pick-up and has its applications on off-road driving as well.<br>
<br>
The introduction of the ABS ‘plus’ has improved the braking system which has 
been particularly designed for off-road vehicles. This results in shorter 
braking distances on off-road by up to 20 per cent. This could be an important 
change since all the ABS systems in general, have a negative effect on sandy 
surfaces.<br>
<br>
<b>The Interior</b><br>
At first look, the interior is still the same with good spacing between the 
buttons throughout the dashboard. The steering wheel has more than its share of 
buttons, though this fact is subjective to the drivers’ taste. The ignition is 
placed in an appropriate position, by being higher. This makes sure that the key 
avoids contact with the knee but it stands out awkwardly and is prone to being 
hit by random hand movement. <br>
<br>
The audio system displayed the performance of an expensive aftermarket system, 
with deep bass and clear tone. However for the watt hungry, there is an option 
of the 600 watt Dynaudio sound system.<br>
<br>
The Touareg comes standard with cruise control, but as an optional extra has the 
Automatic Distance Control (ACC). The ACC assists the driver by automatically 
keeping space between the car ahead and itself. For example, on the road when a 
car in front brakes or reduces speed, the ACC would automatically apply the 
brakes and if necessary, bring the car to a halt. The drawback observed with the 
cruise control system is that the minimum increment to the cruising speed is 
10kmph, which leaves less room for fine adjustments.<br>
<br>
<b><img border="0" src="car2.jpg" hspace="6" vspace="4" align="left">Technology Notes<br>
</b>In particular, we noted a very impressive accessory. Along with the spare 
wheel, there comes a small sized electronic air compressor. This is capable of 
filling air in any tyre by connecting its plug points to the battery. This 
feature can be a blessing in off-road situations.<br>
<br>
The Touareg also has a line of very refined diesel engines, with the benchmark 
for all being the V10 TDI. It is ‘one of the most powerful diesel engines fitted 
in a series passenger car’. With torque being a whopping 550lbs.ft, it does 
0-100kmph in only 7.4 seconds.<br>
<br>
The Touareg, in all its means, displayed miles of practicality by being a rugged 
off road vehicle. This is topped by the luxury and performance that it has to 
offer. There are two main judging criteria for every SUV, on-road and off-road. 
These two usually complement each other since boosting one adversely affects the 
other. As a footnote for the Touareg, both on-road and off-road performance are 
outstanding. This vehicle is something that will be with you all the way, from 
the narrow corners of the city to the rugged open spaces of the interiors. The 
Touareg has more than enough excitement to offer, while giving that everyday 
reliable performance which is very difficult to find.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<div align="center">

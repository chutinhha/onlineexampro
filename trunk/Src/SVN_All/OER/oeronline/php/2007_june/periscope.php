<b>Lebanese bank credit ratings are today a derivative of the Republic of 
Lebanon’s own sovereign credit risk ratings, writes Matein Khalid</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="periscope.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" style="border: 0px solid #EFEFE9; " vspace="4">Ever 
since France’s Ottoman Bank opened its doors from a seafront palace in the 
1860s, Lebanon’s financiers have earned a worldwide reputation for 
entrepreneurial flair, helping to forge pre-war Beirut’s reputation as an 
offshore banking hub, the Switzerland of the Levant. It is no coincidence that 
some of the leading power brokers of modern Lebanon were either bankers or owned 
banking empires, from former President Elias Sarkis to three Prime Ministers 
(Salim Hoss, Rafiq Hariri and Fouad Siniora). As a quintessential service 
economy with a laissez faire capitalist ethos that seeks to regain its historic 
role as a financial entrepot in the Mediterranean, banks are mission critical 
for Lebanon’s economic growth, foreign trade and the financing of government 
debt in a nation whose public sector debt / GDP, at 180 per cent, is the highest 
in the world. The Lebanese banking system has survived a succession of recent 
traumas – the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri, Israel’s devastating 
aerial attack and ground invasion last summer, the political gridlock between 
the government and the opposition over who will succeed President Emil Lahoud 
and the multiple wars in Iraq that cost Lebanon billions lost in exports and 
remittances. Moody’s recently downgraded the credit ratings of Lebanon’s four 
leading banks to a financial strength of D to reflect a grim political milieu 
and the increasing reluctance of bankers to increase their holdings of the 
government’s sovereign Eurobonds and Treasury bills.<br>
<br>
The assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in February 2005 still haunts 
the Lebanese financial markets and banking system. Hariri was the symbol of 
Lebanon’s economic renaissance in the 1990s, whose Solidiere real estate firms 
rebuilt Beirut’s gutted downtown after the Taif Accords ended the 1975-90 civil 
war. He was instrumental in attracting billions of dollars from the Lebanese 
diaspora, Gulf sovereign agencies and Wall Street investment banks to finance 
Lebanon’s postwar reconstruction and development, orchestrating the Paris donor 
conference in 2002 that averted a sovereign default which would have meant 
monetary Armageddon for the Lebanese banking system, whose assets are primarily 
invested in financing the government’s debt. In Beirut recently, I was stunned 
by the visible evidence of Israel’s assault on Lebanese infrastructure. Every 
major bridge in the Bekaa Valley, the Beirut-Jounieh highway and the Sidon 
coastal road was bombed by the IDF. The Israeli war machine inflicted US$11 
billion in damages on Lebanon and led to the destruction of hundreds of roads, 
fuel depots, factories, homes, bridges and power generation plants. Yet, 
amazingly, only six per cent of the Lebanese banking system’s loans are 
estimated to be at risk as a result of the Israeli destruction and 
reconstruction will be largely financed by Hezbollah, the Lebanese government, 
GCC sovereign donors and the World Bank, with only a minor role for Beirut’s 
private bankers. Riad Salameh, the governor of Banque du Liban, estimates that 
only US$100 million in provisions is needed in the banking system’s 
US$17-billion loan book. Yet the secondary impact of the war caused incalculable 
damage to Lebanon’s fiscal future, with lost VAT, export and tourism revenues. 
Lebanon’s credit risk is way below investment grade at a dismal B, meaning that 
its banks’ credit ratings cannot exceed the sovereign ceiling since they hold so 
much government debt, whose political risk premium escalated dramatically after 
the assassination of Hariri. Moreover, more than US$4.5 billion of the US$7.8 
billion in funding pledged by international donors at the Paris III conference 
is conditional on economic reforms under surveillance from the IMF. But 
historically, privatisation and the reform of loss-making Lebanese state-owned 
utilities are paralysed by sectarian patronage networks and the political 
cleavages in the Siniora Cabinet. While Banque du Liban managed to keep the 
Lebanese lira rate stable to the dollar at 1500 and has accumulated no less than 
US$19 billion in hard currency reserves and gold bullion, the central bank 
cannot solve the existential macro dilemmas that haunt Lebanon.<br>
<br>
Lebanon is, ironically, the only Arab state where private financiers, not the 
government, own virtually all banking assets, and the state has never 
nationalised a bank. Moreover, the end of the civil war after the Taif Accord 
and the Hariri era enabled banks to expand their assets ninefold since 1992, 
with banking assets now 350 per cent of GDP, among the highest in the world. 
Lebanese banks also boast exceptional liquidity by any standards in the emerging 
markets, with deposits at US$60 billion or three times its GDP. Lebanon is also 
a de facto dollar economy, with almost three-fourths of deposits and loans 
denominated in the greenback. With almost 70 commercial, Islamic and private 
banks, Lebanon’s branch per capita metrics easily compares with Western European 
countries. Yet Lebanon’s bankers are hostage to their sovereign’s public 
finance. After all, Lebanon borrowed heavily since Taif, with its gross public 
debt rising from US$3 billion in 1992 to almost US$40 billion now, making 
Lebanon the most frequent Arab sovereign issuer in the Eurobond market. However, 
almost half of outstanding sovereign Lebanese Eurobonds are not held by fund 
managers in London or Wall Street but by Lebanon’s five major commercial banks. 
Lebanon’s banks are significantly exposed to their own government, which in turn 
is exposed to the vagaries of war, peace and capital flight in the Middle East. 
Lebanese bank credit ratings are thus a derivative of the Republic of Lebanon’s 
own sovereign credit risk ratings. A natural strategy to reduce their sovereign 
debt exposure risk compelled the major Lebanese banks to accumulate assets in 
Syria, Algeria, Egypt and the GCC. Lebanon’s banks are liquid and well managed 
and the Banque du Liban is among the most respected central banks in the Arab 
world. If the state overcomes political shocks and succeeds in the IMF 
adjustment programme, Lebanese banks’ profit, growth and credit worthiness would 
warrant a compelling bullish case. </font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

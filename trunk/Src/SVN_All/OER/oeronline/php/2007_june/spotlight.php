<b>The overall positive outlook of the economy is having a multiplier effect on 
the automobile batteries, tyres and lubricant market in Oman</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="spot.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The tyre, lubricant and batteries sector in Oman 
is going through a healthy growth curve over the last couple of years. The 
rising sales of commercial as well as personal automobiles have had a positive 
impact on growth. Almost all the leading brands of tyres, batteries and 
lubricants have their presence in Oman and each brand, in its effort to 
capitalise on sales opportunities, is offering lucrative schemes and incentives 
to both the customers as well as dealers.<br>
<br>
The overall market scenario in the GCC reflects a similar trend. According to a 
report by Gulf Organisation for Industrial Consulting, GCC member-states produce 
a number of spare parts, such as lubricant oils, batteries, brake shoes, and 
air-filters. The bulk of such industries are based in Saudi Arabia, Oman and 
Kuwait. However, car tyres are being recycled and not manufactured in this 
region. As far as metal tyres are concerned, Bahrain’s Aluminium Tyres Company 
produces large quantities, all of which are being exported.<br>
<br>
Overall, the GCC region has been a profitable market for tyres, lubricants and 
batteries. European brands have always dominated the lubricant industry globally 
with very few originating from Japan and Middle East, like the UAE and Oman. 
Similarly, the battery market has also been traditionally dominated by European 
brands, though of late, the supply has been coming from countries like 
Indonesia, South Korea or Saudi Arabia with an indigenous brand from Oman. 
Unlike lubricants and batteries, Oman has only tyre-trading industry as there is 
no rubber production in the country.<br>
<br>
<b>Rising prices</b><br>
With the prices of crude oil, steel, and other base materials for tyres, 
batteries, and lubricants shooting up, the sector in Oman is however being 
directly impacted. As S K Wig, General Manager, Mohsin Haider Darwish, explains, 
“Prices of tyres and batteries are volatile worldwide and price increases have 
been fuelled mainly by rise in prices of natural rubber, oil derivatives, steel 
and lead. Energy costs have gone up as well. Hence, higher prices have been a 
universal phenomenon across all brands of tyres and batteries. With regard to 
the Oman market, the demand for tyres and batteries is currently strong on 
account of the several infrastructural projects being undertaken and this trend 
is expected to continue.”<br>
<br>
The car sale volume is also increasing rapidly in Oman for the past couple of 
years and estimates say that it will continue to grow for some more time to 
come. In the tyre segment, the market has a wide range of brands like Michelin, 
Pirelli, Hankook, Yokohama, Bridgestone, GoodYear, Toyo, Falken, Kumho, 
Continental, Ceat, etc. Apart from the increase in car sales, the growing demand 
of tyres is also due to the usage and maintenance. In the GCC region – being the 
hot seat for a longer duration of summer season than the rest of the world – 
tyres are one accessory that bear the brunt of burning temperatures. A few good 
thumb rules can prevent untimely change of the tyres ensuring the consumer good 
value for money.<br>
<br>
<b>Moving up the ladder</b><br>
As far as the lubricants market is concerned, the industry has more than 30 
international players in the Middle East region. Major players in the Middle 
East are Shell, BP/Castrol, Mobil, Total, Elf, Caltex, Valvoline, Gulf Oil, 
ADNOC, Veedol, Crown, ENOC, Fuchs and National. <br>
<br>
The demand for lubricants has significantly increased in the Sultanate of late 
due to economic environment, population growth, general level of motorisation 
and industrialisation. Shell Oman has the largest market share in terms of total 
production, while Shell Rotella leads the market in the diesel engine oil 
segment, and BP’s Visco 2000 leads in the petrol engine oil segment. The three 
sectors which are the main consumers for lubricants in Oman are, commercial and 
industrial sectors with consumption standing at 60 per cent; the automotive 
sector consuming about 35 per cent of the lubes; and, the marine sector 
utilising 5 per cent.<br>
<br>
Sunil Bantwal, Sales Manager, Oman Mechanical Services Co. Ltd. LLC, dealer of 
Mobil lubricant says: “Due to the economic boom in the country and the growth of 
industries, especially in the Sohar belt, there has been a huge demand for 
industrial lubricants in the last two years. Increase in the number of vehicles 
on the road has also increased the demand for automotive lubricants. With 
technology changing every day, demand for high performance lubricants has 
increased in recent times. New equipment and vehicles are coming out with 
requirement for synthetic lubricants, which, unlike mineral-based oil, keep the 
engine parts, gears, etc., in good condition for a longer period of time.”<br>
<br>
When it comes to making a choice in picking up lubricant for their cars, 
customers in Oman are going for the best. As Alwyn Martin, Head, TBLE Division, 
Al-Hashar &amp; Co, distributor of Veedol lubricants and products such as petrol 
engine oils, diesel engine oils, gear oils, automatic transmission fluids, brake 
fluids, coolants, greases, hydraulic fluids, says: “In Oman, most consumers are 
very conscious about which lubricant they use. However, the trend of 
international price increases in all lubricants has disturbed the fluency of the 
business over the past two years. To add to this problem, most of the brands 
have pampered the dealers in a big way by offering schemes, etc., to promote 
their lubricants and every brand is competing with the other in promotions to be 
one step ahead.”<br>
<br>
<b>Charging up</b><br>
With the automobile sector on an upward curve for the last few years, the 
battery market is also experiencing an upswing. The Oman market has 
traditionally been dominated by European giants. Global big players such as 
Exide, AC Delco, Yuasa, NBC, FB and Rocket among others have had a firm footing 
in the Omani market. However, there is one brand in the market – Reem Batteries 
(Antara) – that is a 100 per cent indigenous product. <br>
<br>
In recent years, products from Indonesia (GS and Incoe) and South Korea (Aurora) 
are also making inroads and are increasing the competition. Consumers also have 
to be careful as some few players lower prices by introducing low-quality gear. 
Nevertheless, the global players have an edge over the low-quality products in 
terms of reach as well range of products. The premium brands enjoy a good 
distribution network through a network of branches and a dedicated sales force.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>From being a techie to a marketing honcho, Nawras COO Khalid Al Mahmoud has 
done it all, and yet believes there’s more, reports Sunil Kumar Singh<br>
</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="person.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">If you ever happen to meet him, at first glance 
he would appear just like any other topline corporate. But as you get to know 
him better, you’ll discover the string of success stories behind this 
personality. “I believe there is always a shortcut to success and that is to 
work smart. It means building synergy among team members and to get the best out 
of each person,” says Khalid bin Ibrahim A Al Mahmoud, sharing his mantra of 
success.<br>
<br>
In his more than 16 years of well-rounded experience in the telecom sector, 
Khalid has held various positions of increasing responsibility, in fields 
ranging from IT, ISP and data management to product management and marketing. 
His knowledge spans product/service management, marketing, project management, 
strategy development and execution. “I have always tried to be abreast of useful 
information, specially in my field and market. It pays to be conversant with the 
world around you, enabling you to make the right decisions. Moreover, the key to 
success is to draw a balance in life, balancing your personal and professional 
life, balancing your short-term and long-term goals, ensuring that each part 
gets its due,” he rejoins.<br>
<br>
<b>Working smart</b><br>
A graduate in electrical engineering, with a major in computer engineering, from 
Pennsylvania in 1988, Khalid is the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Nawras 
since February 2005. Nawras is the brand name of Oman’s second mobile operator – 
the Omani Qatari Telecommunications Company SAOC – which launched its operations 
in March 2005. The majority shareholder in the company is Qatar Telecom (QTel), 
the exclusive telecommunications provider in Qatar.<br>
<br>
An ardent advocate of hard work, Khalid, however, feels that this alone is not 
enough. Also, it is not the volume of workload that one can manage, but how 
smartly one does it. And his successful stint with QTel, the holding company of 
Nawras, speaks louder than his words. Khalid joined QTel as a computer 
programmer just after his graduation and has not looked back ever since, moving 
up through the company, holding different portfolios and managing different 
profiles. In fact, as information technology (IT) divisional manager at QTel, he 
was responsible for laying down and managing the company’s IT strategy, which 
resulted in several significant improvements in critical IT areas, such as 
billing and customer care.<br>
<br>
After 10 years in QTel’s information technology department, Khalid was 
re-designated to lead the company’s data and internet business unit in Qatar, 
with the responsibility of improving the internet services and overhauling data 
network operations.<br>
<br>
In 2003, his career took a big turn, when he was appointed senior manager, 
product management and marketing at QTel and was in-charge of overseeing 
management, development and marketing of all wire-line services, including 
international and, national calls, data, internet and many other ancillary 
products. After a successful two-year stint heading QTel’s marketing unit, 
Khalid was seconded to Nawras as Chief Operating Officer.<br>
<br>
<b>Home is where the heart is</b><br>
Originally from Qatar, Khalid has been living in Oman ever since he joined 
Nawras. Asked how did he find settling in Oman as compared to Qatar, he replied: 
“I never thought that Oman could be so beautiful. Unlike other GCC countries, 
Oman is different in terms of landscape, people, culture, etc. Such diversity is 
its strength. It has been a very enriching experience for me to work in a 
competitive environment and lead the team.”<br>
<br>
Khalid finds Oman’s telecom market to be a very challenging one as well as one 
having tremendous growth prospects. “I’ve been working in an exciting and 
dynamic environment. In my more than two-year spell in Nawras, I feel as if I 
have got 20 years of experience because of the volume of challenges I face 
regularly in putting into place a world-class telecom infrastructure.”<br>
<br>
<b>Learning from experiences</b><br>
On his ability to productively manage different fronts, Khalid reasons, “I 
always had the inspiration of leading the people and having a strong influence 
on the direction of the company. The biggest strength I have is being internally 
focussed. Before joining QTel’s marketing department, I was keen on acquiring 
experiences of different departments, such as customer service, systems and 
product development, and this gave me the perspective on different aspects of 
the business.”<br>
<br>
Khalid believes that the success of any corporate hinges on its people and the 
relationships among them as well as with the management. “What makes an 
organisation successful are its people. This is why I put special focus on 
people. If they are happy, they’ll go the extra mile to achieve the targets of 
an organisation.”<br>
<br>
As his profile warrants more and more time on work, Khalid finds it difficult to 
find time for leisure and to unwind. But whenever he finds the time, he never 
misses out on his passion for flying light aircraft and fishing. Besides, on 
weekends, he ensures that he spends some time with his family in Doha. “Being 
close to aircraft has enchanted me all along. Flying gives me the inspiration to 
move higher and higher in life, and the realisation that there is always scope 
to learn and grow.” </font></p>

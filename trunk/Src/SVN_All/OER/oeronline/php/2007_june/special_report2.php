<b>Her Highness Sayyida Aliya bint Thuwaini Al Said, Director, The Chedi Hotel, 
and Patron of the Al Noor Association for the Blind, in a chat with Akshay 
Bhatnagar talks about how women are coming up in business in Oman<br>
</b><br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="special1.jpg" width="150" height="173" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">What 
is the state of women in business in Oman?<br>
</b>Women in Oman have come a long way. Earlier, due to lack of education and 
opportunities, women were not playing a significant role in the economic 
development of the Sultanate. Today, women are focusing on getting a proper 
education and thus better prepared to decide and plan their careers. The mindset 
of families is also changing, as they are giving equal importance to education 
and career development of their womenfolk. No wonder, today Oman has four female 
ministers, who are doing an excellent work.<br>
<br>
On the business front, we have shining examples such as Hind Bahwan, Lujaina 
Darwish and Areej Zawawi, all of whom have proved that women can not only match 
but also outperform men in business management. Likewise there are many Omani 
women who are successfully running their own medium and small enterprises. The 
need of the hour is to bring in more women, not just in the cities but in the 
interiors also, to optimally harness the power of women in the development of 
Oman. <br>
<br>
<b>What steps should be taken by the government and the corporate sector to 
harness woman power?<br>
</b>The government has done an excellent job in creating the environment that 
facilitates equal opportunities for women and men. The Sanad programme is a good 
initiative to encourage and promote entrepreneurship among the Omanis. Many 
women have benefited from this programme. It helps in not only providing the 
seed money to kickstart a business but also impart the necessary skills, 
training and guidance to become a successful businesswoman. The private sector 
is already encouraging women at all levels. You go to sunrise sectors, such as 
telecommunications, tourism, retail, banking, etc., and the chances are that you 
may find many women occupying the top slots.<br>
<br>
<b>How is the Women in Business Conference ’07 expected to promote Omani women 
in business?<br>
</b>Women in Business Conference ’07 is the first event of its kind in the 
Sultanate that brings on a common platform successful women from Oman and the 
international arena. The role models will share their experience with other 
women who aspire to become successful in business or career. It will provide an 
excellent opportunity for women to gain from sharing their knowledge and 
business vision. The event will inspire many women to come forward and give 
shape to their dreams.<br>
<br>
<b>How has been your experience as a businesswoman?</b><br>
I’ve always challenged myself to do things that have been traditionally 
restricted to men. I’ve been involved in charity related activities for quite 
some time. And I wanted to apply my management skills, honed in charity work, in 
a different kind of business. More than three years ago, I joined as a director 
on the board of The Chedi Hotel. As I was quite raw in hotel business, in the 
first year, I focused on building knowledge on the industry and related business 
affairs by observing others, reading reference books, surfing internet and 
talking to industry experts. From the second year onwards, I started making a 
more meaningful contribution to the business by actively participating in the 
decision-making process. <br>
<br>
<b>Do you aspire to build your own business from scratch?</b><br>
Absolutely! Though there is no end to the learning process, but today I feel 
confident that I can conceptualise, plan and run my own business. In fact, I 
have just finalised the feasibility aspect of developing land near The Chedi 
Hotel.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

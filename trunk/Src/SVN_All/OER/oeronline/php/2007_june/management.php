<br>
<img border="0" src="manag.jpg" width="350" height="275" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">When, in 2006, DP World acquired the British port and ferry operator P&amp;O, in a 
deal valued at US$7.1 billion, political debate over the company’s ownership of 
US port assets dominated the headlines. What was not in dispute was the 
transaction’s significance for the industry – the deal catapulted DP World to 
the position of the world’s third-largest container terminal operator.<br>
<br>
Lying behind that massive acquisition is a growing trend for companies from 
across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – to use petrodollars flooding 
into the region to finance strategic investments abroad. Even if oil prices 
declined modestly over the next few years, these states are likely to accumulate 
US$2.4 trillion in windfall revenues through 2014. While much of this money is 
headed toward domestic investments in healthcare, education and infrastructure, 
a significant portion of it is financing overseas investments.<br>
<br>
Deep pockets alone, however, will not buy GCC companies a seat at the global 
economy’s head table. If they are to become global leaders in their industries, 
they will have to master capabilities that equip them to face global 
competition.<br>
<br>
Companies of all stripes are active in this transformation. The petrochemical 
giant, Saudi Basic Industries (Sabic) was among the early movers, acquiring the 
petrochemical division of the Dutch chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, DSM, in 
2002 for US$2 billion. The deal helped Sabic become the world’s 10th largest 
chemical company, with revenues of US$20.9 billion in 2005.<br>
<br>
Private companies are also fuelling the trend. In 2005, the Kuwaiti logistics 
group, Agility (formerly PWC Logistics), bought companies in Singapore and the 
US as part of a drive to become one of the world’s top logistics groups. 
Smaller, family-owned businesses, such as the Saudi independent car distributor, 
Abdul Latif Jameel (ALJ), and the Kuwaiti retailer, M.H. Alshaya, are rapidly 
venturing into Europe, Russia and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<b>Building capacity</b><br>
In general, two factors motivate such expansionist ambitions. The first is the 
need to find new growth opportunities as domestic markets become saturated. Many 
GCC companies are larger and more advanced than their counterparts in 
neighbouring North Africa and the countries bordering the eastern Mediterranean.<br>
<br>
Although these regional markets can provide a significant growth opportunity for 
any company – in mobile telecommunications, for example – the inherent risks and 
relatively small size of the markets have kept them off the agenda of many large 
multinationals.<br>
<br>
The second motive for expansion is a desire to acquire particular skills or 
capabilities. Acquisitions in Europe and North America, especially, are 
typically part of a broader strategy to gain rapid access to Western management 
know-how and technology; they allow Gulf companies to short-circuit the 
laborious task of building such capabilities internally.<br>
<br>
In 2006, for example, the Dubai property group, Emaar Properties, acquired both 
the second-largest private homebuilder in the US, John Laing Homes (for US$1 
billion), and the UK realtor Hamptons International (for US$154 million). 
Besides gaining access to the British and US markets, Emaar can now draw on John 
Laing’s vast experience in real-estate development and Hamptons’ expertise in 
marketing.<br>
<br>
Strong cash positions have not only opened the door for aggressive takeover 
strategies but have also given GCC companies time to learn about new markets and 
to absorb the skills they need.<br>
<br>
The advantages that drive margins at home – high-income customer pools, cheap 
labour and low energy costs – can’t be transferred to external markets, and Gulf 
companies will need to become more efficient abroad to be profitable there. The 
acquiring companies must out of necessity bring in (or quickly develop) special 
capabilities that foster competitive advantages.<br>
<br>
Acquisitions inspired by growth will probably have to be underpinned by a strong 
customer service ethos, while integration skills will be especially important 
when an acquirer buys a company to gain its capabilities. Other factors also 
come into play: for example, customers will span a broader range of incomes, 
including a large segment of the poor and “near poor”. Segmentation, pricing and 
cost-efficiency skills will be crucial in these cases.<br>
<br>
In addition, companies will have to transform their organisations to manage 
operations across a number of countries, and finding and retaining managerial 
talent will require more attention as the need for it develops.<br>
<br>
<b>Cultural adjustments</b><br>
The long-term success of expanding GCC companies may also rest on something more 
nebulous – a change in corporate culture. In the GCC and throughout the Arab 
world, relationships between people and social structures have traditionally 
carried great weight in every aspect of life: social, business and public. What 
in the West would be criticised as nepotism or cronyism is still widely accepted 
in the GCC as a way of reinforcing cultural bonds.<br>
<br>
Yet, as Gulf companies expand into other cultures and compete to hire top global 
talent, they will need to find a balance between their own established cultural 
mores and the expectations of the global corporate environment. This challenge 
will extend to the boardrooms: GCC acquirers must understand and work within the 
governance structures of other business environments, which may be quite 
different from the GCC norm. The board of the acquired company must be active 
and aggressive in setting performance targets for it and not allow it to drift 
without direction after the takeover.<br>
<br>
In the near term, a steady diet of petrodollars will fuel the growth trend. But 
over the longer term, larger servings of distinctive capabilities and skills 
must balance the menu.<br>

				<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The real estate market in the 
				country is returning to normalcy with a generous demand for both 
				commercial and rental properties, thanks to the consistent 
				economic growth witnessed by Oman despite the slowdown of the 
				past two years</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				When The volatile period of the past two years has eased for the 
				real estate sector and stability now has returned with an 
				increased supply as well as demand for the entire spectrum of 
				properties – from high end to low end.On the demand and supply 
				side, the demand for apartments and supply are evenly matched. 
				But there is an excess supply of villas. Construction costs and 
				land prices have come down therefore housing is much more 
				affordable now than in 2008. But there is nothing like a 
				breakthrough, which will make house prices very cheap.<br>
				<br>
				According to the Ministry of National Economy’s monthly 
				statistical bulletin, the price index for rents confirmed a 16 
				per cent increase in January of 2009, compared to the same month 
				the previous year. Meanwhile, a slight challenge still exists in 
				commercial propert spaces in the medium range. The rents of 
				commercial spaces are much lower than what existed in the peak 
				of 2008. Given land price and construction costs, prevailing 
				rents give reasonable returns to the developer as well.<br>
				<br>
				Figures released by the ministry of housing, in the first 
				quarter of the year indicate that there is a 62 per cent rise in 
				sale value of property and 11 per cent rise in the sale volumes 
				compared to corresponding period last year.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#000080" size="2">
				Price corrections</font></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				The property prices peaked in 2008 and moderately dropped since 
				then. The phase of price correction that the market had 
				experienced through 2009 is over. Market experts have predicted 
				that rental prices may not go down any further but instead the 
				market is expected to move forward.<br>
				<br>
				Vacancy rates in rented houses have decreased significantly 
				since 2003, despite an influx of new units. Before the so-called 
				real estate bubble, apartments that were rented out at RO250, 
				reached RO600, today the prices have come down and became stable 
				at RO450 after correction. Although the prices are now 
				stabilising, they still remain high.<br>
				<br>
				Comparing the current rents with that of 2008, rents have come 
				down. But between 2009 and 2010 10 there isn’t much difference. 
				Between 2008 and 2009 there was a drop of 15- 20 per cent in 
				rents of apartments. The government expenditure in the 
				infrastructure development for ports, airports and roads is 
				giving a boost to the economy. Consequently, there is going to 
				be more liquidity in the money market and the standards of 
				living are expected to go up. This will see more spendings and a 
				resultant growth across the economy. Such growth will definitely 
				be witnessed in the real estate sector as well.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>
				Financing</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				In 2009, banks and investors were unwilling to provide funds to 
				the sector but 2010 has witnessed a change in attitude. Both 
				banks and investors are willing to lend at present. While many 
				speculators were active in the real estate market earlier, the 
				people who buy property now are real investors. They are the 
				people who actually buy properties that they now want to live 
				in.<br>
				<br>
				For a reliable client, funding is not an issue but banks no 
				longer fund speculative activates and they would like to see 
				tangible results from a project. Some market observers feel that 
				the issue facing Muscat is that of an oversupply of properties. 
				There has been a lot of building activity in terms of office 
				space supply, which might be absorbed at a low rate. People are 
				still looking at developments but they are more realistic about 
				their feasibility studies.<br>
				<br>
				People are much more aware now than they were three years ago. 
				If you are looking for a quick short-term profit from 
				investments in property market, then it is high risk. But 
				people, who look at long-term investments, will be successful.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>
				Affordable housing</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				The crash of the real estate sector in the turmoil of global 
				financial crisis has given a new urgency to affordable housing. 
				Oman’s beachfront and cityscape are dotted with high-end 
				luxurious properties that are much talked about. Ongoing 
				projects in the housing sector, especially in the affordable 
				housing sector are progressing fast and serious buyers are 
				active in the market. Real estate agents are getting enquires. 
				But for Omanis, who belong to the middle rung of the society, 
				this expensive housing, which is currently available in the 
				market, is not affordable. Therefore, affordable housing is the 
				need of the hour. <br>
				<br>
				One of them is the growing young population of Oman, which is 
				also becoming affluent. A whopping 60 per cent of Oman’s 
				population is below the age of 30 with the average salary earned 
				being RO600. It is this segment that wants to create their own 
				set-up and want to invest and buy property such as those 
				available on affordable investment schemes. It is estimated that 
				by 2025, the country’s population will swell to 5 million from 
				the current 3.3 million.<br>
				<br>
				In the absence of official price statistics for the real estate 
				sector, both rental and sale prices are estimated to have 
				doubled over the past four years. It is a fact that many Omanis 
				are finding it hard to keep up with rising housing costs. There 
				is a speculation that rents will further go up in 2011 for new 
				properties. The government has done its bit to ensure that 
				Omanis in the middle to low income brackets do not get priced 
				out of the housing market.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>High 
				potential</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				To limit the impact of the high prices, in June 2008, an 
				amendment in the 2007 housing law limited the cap on rental 
				price increase to 7 per cent per annum for three years, 
				subsequent to the signing of a lease agreement. Under the 
				previous cap, landlords could increase rent up to 15 per cent 
				over two years. This may have a bearing on how flats are taken 
				on rent.<br>
				<br>
				Many Omanis who work in Muscat currently take flats on rent but 
				are interested in paying an equated monthly (mortgage) 
				installment that is equal to monthly (rental) rates in order to 
				finance a property purchase. The average income of this 
				particular segment rests between RO700 and RO900, though that 
				may not be the full picture of his income. His earnings may also 
				come from other sources like stock market, financial support 
				from family, land, shops and rents.<br>
				<br>
				In the absence of personal tax, it is difficult to assess 
				people’s income. There is a potential demand for affordable 
				housing, which will continue growing as Oman’s large youth 
				population moves away from joint families to the system of 
				nuclear families. However, in the absence of a proper survey, 
				demand cannot be quantified. Oman’s biggest advantage is that it 
				has sprawling land, prices for which had dropped dramatically at 
				one point of time. Location wise, there are two segments of 
				markets, based on personal preferences. There is demand for 
				houses in Muscat city; a sound infrastructure and a happening 
				city life being the reason behind such demand.<br>
				<br>
				The government of Oman is spending a huge amount of money on 
				infrastructure projects like the Southern Express highway and 
				Batinah Coast Highway. Muscat International airport expansion is 
				going on. In short, Muscat is getting connected to the outskirts 
				of the city and there are buyers, who by choice, would like to 
				be located there for comfort and a bigger house, away from the 
				hustle and bustle of city life.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>
				Popularising the segment</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				According to the statistics from MONE, the wholesale price 
				index, for building materials in Muscat fell to 163.2. The index 
				has plummeted further as the cost of steel, cement and other 
				materials remain low due to decreased worldwide demand stemming 
				from the global meltdown. This dip in construction and materials 
				costs has spurred developers to deliver more units to the 
				expanding middle-income market. Their high price was once a 
				prohibitive factor in building affordable housing. But with the 
				situation easing out, developers are now looking to increase 
				their presence in the sustainably affordable housing sector or 
				on reasonably priced properties.<br>
				<br>
				However, Omanis have not yet reconciled to the fact that they 
				can own and live in apartments as most of the people perceive 
				them as smaller and closed space. The general preference is for 
				more open space as in villas. Developers need to raise awareness 
				among buyers to invest in this kind of property. Generally, an 
				affordable property hovers between RO50,000 and RO70,000. Muscat 
				is becoming a much denser city, which is making affordable 
				housing increasingly important. Certain areas are zoned and 
				rezoned for allowing the higher density development, based on 
				the infrastructure provided around them.<br>
				<br>
				Companies like Alargan Towell Investment, Zain Property 
				Development and a few others are moving in to take advantage of 
				low-cost constructions.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Moody’s 
				forecast</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				The supply-demand imbalance remains a key driver of the 
				continued negative outlook for the property industry in the 
				Arabian Gulf, says Moody’s Investors Service in a new Industry 
				Outlook report. The negative outlook reflects the rating 
				agency’s view of fundamental credit conditions in the industry 
				over the next 12-18 months.<br>
				<br>
				“The supply-demand imbalance in commercial property and to some 
				degree in residential units, depending on the city or country, 
				is likely to grow worse as vast supply meets slack demand and is 
				a major driver of our negative outlook,” says Martin Kohlhase, a 
				Moody’s Assistant Vice President – Analyst and author of the 
				report. In the report, Moody’s notes that the other drivers of 
				the outlook remain the same as in 2009, namely funding and the 
				preservation of cash, which includes potential disposals of 
				non-core assets, cash collection and debt standstill agreements. 
				Moody’s believes that these factors will remain in place for the 
				rest of 2010, albeit with a different emphasis from the previous 
				year.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Ratings 
				downgraded</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				The rating agency further notes that it has downgraded the 
				ratings of all GCC issuers with real estate exposure over the 
				past 12 months. The average rating of A2 at the beginning of 
				April 2009 now stands at Ba1, a five-notch drop. This is largely 
				a reflection of lower government support assumptions that had 
				underpinned a number of ratings.<br>
				<br>
				However, although Moody’s industry outlook for the region as a 
				whole is negative, it notes that significant differences 
				continue to exist across the region, with Saudi Arabia seen as 
				the brightest spot of the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) 
				countries. “The large, growing and young population of this 
				Kingdom continues to support the local residential market,” 
				explains Kohlhase. “Furthermore, rent and sale prices have 
				remained stable in prime areas, while limited price correction 
				has been witnessed on the outskirts.”<br>
				<br>
				The rating agency says that several factors could prompt a 
				revision of the outlook to stable, including government spending 
				for public infrastructure work; government intervention; a 
				shortage of low- and middle-income housing and international 
				expansion. “However, we do not envisage moving to a stable 
				outlook in the near term,” Kohlhase cautions.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Foreign 
				investment </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				One of the biggest countries in the Middle East, the Sultanate 
				holds tremendous potential in terms of trade, industrial growth 
				and of course, real estate. As a result of a long maritime 
				history and interaction with various cultures, Oman can 
				rightfully claim that it is the friendliest country in the Gulf 
				basin. Today, Oman is one of the fastest growing economies in 
				the Gulf, thanks to prudent government planning, responsible 
				expenditure as well as heavy investment in the non-oil sector.
				<br>
				<br>
				Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Oman boasts lush 
				green terrain in certain areas that spell out the promise of a 
				relatively calm and unhurried lifestyle. This country is home to 
				vast agricultural farms that are a vital source of fruits and 
				vegetables to the rest of the GCC. With extensive geographic and 
				climatic diversity, fertile coastal zones and mountains, Oman 
				has the most versatile terrain in the Gulf. As the country is 
				poised to develop further, the local real estate sector is going 
				through an exciting phase. <br>
				<br>
				Oman is attracting foreign investors, not only from the GCC and 
				Asia but also from distant Europe, due to the low cost of its 
				land, high economic growth potential, easy availability of 
				beachfront plots and good infrastructure. Of late, Oman has been 
				investing heavily in its tourism, infrastructure, specifically 
				in its airline, roads and airports. Foreign participation in the 
				tourism industry has also been increasing due to government 
				incentives to investors. <br>
				<br>
				Over the last five to ten years tourism in Oman has taken off in 
				a big way, with remarkable growth being experienced recently. 
				There has been an increase in direct, non-stop flights from key 
				international markets which have identified the potential of 
				Oman as both a tourist and business destination. This boom in 
				the tourism sector is reflected in the real estate industry as 
				well.<br>
				<br>
				Advantages of property Investment in Oman<br>
				Oman has zero taxation<br>
				Rental market in tipped in favor of landlord<br>
				Strong economic growth of the country<br>
				Exceptional performance of tourism sector<br>
				Freehold property ownership<br>
				<br>
				The government is drafting a law to attract foreign investments 
				and is on a liberalisation drive to expand the markets. Many 
				multinational companies have taken advantage of the situation 
				and established bases in Oman, especially in Muscat. This has 
				boosted rents and consequently the rental yields.<br>

					</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Taif Properties is 
					one of the most prominent sales and leasing agents in Oman, 
					headed by a long-time resident with an abundance of local 
					knowledge and a deep understanding of the Omani culture.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
					Established in 2006, Taif Properties believes successful 
					long term partnerships are a crucial factor to the continued 
					success in the property market. The successful track record 
					for delivery and careful selection of opportunities has been 
					of fundamental importance in building long term 
					relationships with a number of international investors and 
					developers. <br>
					<br>
					In the beginning the focus was on sales and new developments 
					in Muscat and Salalah which brought many new opportunities 
					for the company not the least of which was teaming up with a 
					well known mega developer from Qatar. This led to new 
					development projects in the countryside beyond Muscat and 
					the beautiful, Indian Ocean town of Salalah.<br>
					<br>
					Taif is now a prominent force to be reckoned with in both 
					sales and leasing and particularly specialises in new 
					expatriates coming to Oman guiding them through the process 
					of finding a new home. Giving advice on schools, 
					neighbourhoods, banks, shopping and anything a new family 
					needs to know is all part of the service which is much 
					appreciated by the new arrivals.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Taif Properties </b>offices are located in the business 
					and diplomatic district of Shatti Al Qurm, close to A’Sarooj.

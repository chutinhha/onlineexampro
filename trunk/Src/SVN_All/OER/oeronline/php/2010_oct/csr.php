				<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>The OHI Group 
				kicked off its Bring a Smile campaign with a novel idea of 
				sending 40 children to Disneyland, Hong Kong. An OER report</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				The OHI Group and Dar Al Atta’a joined hands to take 40 children 
				on their dream vacation to Disneyland. A week-long trip was 
				organised in July as a part of the ‘Bring a Smile’ campaign that 
				OHI has launched in association with Dar Al Atta’a to mark the 
				40th year of Renaissance of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said.<br>
				<br>
				Smiles and giggles were the order of the day as the children 
				returned after the vacation of a lifetime at Disneyland, Hong 
				Kong. The children travelled in two batches and were accompanied 
				by supervisors from OHI and Dar Al Atta’a. The trip was 
				organised by Eihab Travels, an OHI Group company.<br>
				<br>
				On their return the children were full of anecdotes about their 
				trip. “Ever since I heard about it, I’ve yearned to go to 
				Disneyland. I couldn’t believe my luck when I was chosen for 
				this exclusive trip,” declared one of the children, voicing the 
				sentiments of the whole group. In between trying out every 
				single breathtaking ride that Disneyland had to offer, the 
				children rubbed shoulders with Mickey and friends and took 
				enough pictures to fill a dozen albums. “But the excitement 
				didn’t end there,” declared another child. The organisers made 
				sure the children had enough time to explore the four classic 
				theme parks. <br>
				<br>
				The children threw themselves whole-heartedly into the Disney 
				Parade in Main Street, USA and marvelled at the amazing firework 
				display. Tarzan’s Treehouse and an exciting Jungle Cruise were 
				the highlights of USA Adventureland. Fantasyland brought all the 
				Disney princesses to life, while Tomorrowland was a firm 
				favourite with the older children, with its futuristic sci-fi 
				adventures.<br>

				adjectives used by the children to describe their holiday. The 
				news was broken to 12-year-old Aliya Khamis by her teacher. 
				Though she was a bit afraid initially, she was thrilled on 
				reaching Hong Kong. “I enjoyed the games particularly the car 
				games,” says 13-year- old Marwah Nooruddin. On their return the 
				children were greeted as heroes. Says Bassam Mohammed, “Everyone 
				in my family is feeling good and it has become quite an event at 
				home.” If there was one regret that all the children had it was 
				the fact that the trip ended so fast. The smallest child sums it 
				up succinctly – “Now I know dreams do come true!”<br>
				Maqbool Hameed, Chairman, OHI Group says, “The five-day 
				all-expenses paid trip to Disneyland is just the beginning of 
				the ‘Bring a Smile’ campaign through which our main objective is 
				to give back to those less fortunate. We admire Dar Al Atta’as 
				commitment to reaching out to the underprivileged, and are proud 
				to support them in every way we can. We believe in the power of 
				partnerships, and we shall strive to join hands with all the 
				right organisations to change lives for the better,” he adds.<br>

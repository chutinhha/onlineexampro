				growth plans of the company following the launch of its IPO. 
				Excerpts from a candid interview with Visvas Paul D Karra<br>
&nbsp;</font></b><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<b>Nawras is the first company in Oman to use a book-building 
				process for an IPO. How did you arrive at a fair price with this 
				method?</b><br>
				<br>
				When we sat with the Capital Market Authority (CMA) for our IPO, 
				they said the banks had recommended an improved process of price 
				setting and they actually had asked BankMuscat to study this 
				process over the last two years and they had concluded that the 
				time was ripe to introduce the book-building process. In 
				addition, we were glad to be part of this process as it is yet 
				another first.<br>
				<br>
				The principle is that the process interrogates all the 
				professional investors who follow telecommunications in this 
				region. They are the experts who have paid to get the answers 
				right. They were asked en masse to tell how many shares they 
				would buy at different prices. This means that you can basically 
				draw a demand curve and since you know how many shares are 
				available and you have the demand curve, the place where they 
				intersect is the fair price for the institutions.<br>
				<br>
				<b>If it is a fair price for the institutions, how can you say 
				that it is a fair price for retail investors?</b><br>
				<br>
				Well, the fact is that they (institutional investors) are 
				specialists at that business. Clearly some get it right more 
				than others but they are still fully informed as compared to 
				retail investors who can of course never be fully informed 
				because it is not their job. Therefore, they can rely on the 
				fact that the price, which is finally struck, is a price, which 
				should broadly meet the available demand with the available 
				supply, in other words a fair price.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Why did you choose the book-building approach for your IPO?</b><br>
				<br>
				People are concerned about after-markets therefore book-building 
				helps in this. Firstly, because the equilibrium of the price 
				setting is so much better than other methods. There should be 
				relative stability going forward, all other things remaining 
				equal.<br>
				<br>
				Secondly, because of the process, the institutions will look at 
				their appetite in a demand-curve way, which means that if they 
				see a difference in pricing as they go forward they are ready to 
				come in. So it creates stability. You are talking to the manager 
				of the company now. You may ask why we need a stable life. What 
				we are doing is looking after customers. Now if we lose that 
				focus, it is not a good way of spending our time. The virtuous 
				circle we have at the moment is that if we look after our 
				customers properly, they will use our service; if they use our 
				service, that drives our financials and that looks after the 
				shareholders. So we try to stay focussed. That’s why we like 
				stable markets. Now obviously, our challenge – one that we 
				gladly accept – is to try to grow that value over time. It is an 
				important point to remember that we are still talking about a 
				growth company; this is not just a dividend yield company. So, 
				if you look at Nawras it is something very special. You will be 
				a very satisfied receiver of dividends and you will also be 
				participating in a company that is growing. We think it is very 
				attractive and we are very excited by this opportunity.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How successful will Nawras IPO be in the prevailing weakened 
				economic conditions?</b><br>
				<br>
				I see success being defined as ‘happy sellers meet happy 
				buyers’. Then this is also a kind of an opportunity for us. At 
				the moment, people may have an opportunity to enjoy our services 
				or they may choose not to; but this IPO can now appeal to an 
				even wider group and we may attract people who are not our 
				customers to invest. Maybe we can get them to try our services 
				as well. We think it is a very good time to come into the market 
				from an operational point of view because we can really meet and 
				exceed the demands of the new shareholders and at the same time 
				attract new customers.<br>
				<br>
				Shareholders will be curious to know the growth areas for 
				Nawras, knowing that you have geographical limitations for any 
				expansion.<br>
				<br>
				We see growth in a number of areas. By the way we don’t feel 
				geographically limited, as we have got over 300,000 sq mtrs of 
				land in Oman (laughs) itself. The growth that we see in 
				continuing the mobile business, with 140 per cent penetration, 
				is enormous if you just compare with the UAE, which has 230 per 
				cent, SIM card penetration. And we are seeing growth every day 
				with hundreds of customers being added everyday.<br>
				<br>
				The other growth areas are largely new, making us very excited. 
				The first is in the business corporate market. In the past, we 
				had only mobile services but now we can go to the corporates and 
				ask if we can bring fibre to your business as we can provide all 
				types of services. And when we look at our corporate customers 
				in the eye, they look absolutely excited because there is an 
				unrequited demand for real latest fixed services and we have 
				some unique aspects to our product offerings in the fixed area. 
				This is why we have been able to attract some famous names like 
				Imtac, BankDhofar and Oman Air. That means we are already 
				showing the benefits of having that fixed portfolio.<br>
				<br>
				Then there is growth in the international market. As we land our 
				international cable, it gives us the opportunity to take 
				benefits of the geography of Oman as a hub in the region. So we 
				can move other people’s traffic through our country on to other 
				countries. That is a very big business indeed by the way and 
				that is a new revenue stream for Nawras, which we didn’t have 
				before. Apart from that, being part of the Qtel group we have 
				the natural advantage of having a large number of sister 
				companies that would love to route and receive traffic through 
				our cable. So it’s a win win situation. We can be a hub in this 
				region for independent operators of the world and also for our 
				parent company. Domestic broadband is another area of growth. 
				That is relatively underserved. Even if it is as high as 10 or 
				15 per cent in Oman there is still a massive underserved 
				portion. That is a growth oppor-tunity. Because of the 
				international cable and international gateway, we can control 
				our costs much better and because of that we now have the 
				virtuous circle of having more opportunities to control costs 
				and also grow our revenues, which is obviously something, which 
				the shareholders will be very pleased to enjoy as that will 
				translate into more net profits.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Has there been a delay in the listing of the IPO?</b><br>
				<br>
				No, there has been no delay. In terms of the license we are 
				supposed to launch around now.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do you think that, with seven telecom operators in the 
				country, your marketshare will come down?</b><br>
				<br>
				I think that if you look at what we have done well until now, I 
				don’t mean to do anything different now. We will focus on 
				customers. The virtuous circle is we get great people to work in 
				the company who are really enthusiastic about what they are 
				doing. So they look after the customers, and then we will have 
				customers who use more of our services. They will delight the 
				shareholders with increased revenues and profits. That is the 
				approach. Further, as far we are concerned, competition keeps us 
				on our toes. It means we get out of bed every morning delighted 
				because we are having a good focus on our customers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How will the money that will be raised going to be utilised?</b><br>
				<br>
				The money is not coming to the company. The money will just come 
				from a new group of shareholders to the selling shareholders. 
				One-for-one map. So it does not touch Nawras. We have got 
				sufficient funds for our operations. Usually people selling on 
				the stock markets are attracting funding for their operations, 
				whereas we have already got that. We are a growth company with 
				an excellent prospect of dividend yield with enough funding to 
				deliver that internally without any shareholder funding. <br>

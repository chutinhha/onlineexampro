					The IPO, Oman’s first since July 2008, is expected to value 
					Nawras between RO456-586mn<br>
					</font>
					</b>
					<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					Nawras 
					has announced its initial public offering (IPO) for 
					subscription. The IPO of 40 per cent of Nawras’ total share 
					capital is open to Omani and non-Omani individuals and 
					institutional investors. The one-month subscription will 
					close on October 14. Following the listing of Nawras on the 
					Muscat Securities Market on October 27, the shares will 
					trade on the ticker ‘nwrs’.<br>
					<br>
					Commenting on the IPO’s launch, Ross Cormack, the CEO of 
					Nawras, says, “This is the moment when our customers and 
					investors across the Sultanate and internationally will have 
					the opportunity to share in our future through participation 
					in our IPO. Our focus on improving communication in Oman for 
					the past five years has seen us successfully grow our 
					business through offering our customers pleasingly different 
					mobile, fixed line and broadband services. Now is the right 
					time for us to welcome new investors to participate in this 
					true Omani success story.” The IPO, Oman’s first since July 
					2008, is expected to value Nawras at between RO456mn and 
					RO586mn. The price range for the company’s shares will be 
					set at 702 biasa to 902 biasa which includes an issue 
					expense of 2 baisa. The IPO is expected to raise between 
					RO182mn and RO234mn for the selling shareholders.<br>
					<br>
					Cormack adds, “We are very proud of what we have achieved 
					within only five years. None of this would have been 
					possible without the vision of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin 
					Said, the strong support of the TRA and the CMA, the loyalty 
					of our customers, the dedication of our internal Nawras 
					family members and the support of our shareholders. We are 
					grateful to them all. We are delighted to be launching this 
					IPO to enable the Omani public and investment community to 
					get closer to Nawras.”<br>
					<br>
					There are two categories of potential investors who can 
					apply. Category one investors can apply for a minimum of 500 
					shares and in multiples of 100 and category two investors 
					can apply for a minimum of 500,100 shares up to a maximum of 
					26,037,700 shares, or 10 per cent of the offer. Category one 
					or retail investors will initially subscribe at the top of 
					the price range at 902 baisas for a 100-baisa-share. Any 
					refunds will depend on the final pricing and the final 
					allocation of shares to investors.<br>
					<br>
					The final share price will be determined on the basis of the 
					bookbuilding process and is expected to be announced on 
					October 24. All investors will be allotted shares at the 
					final share price which may be lower than the subscription 
					price for category one investors.<br>
					<br>
					Copies of the IPO prospectus and an application are 
					available at the branches of BankMuscat, National Bank of 
					Oman, Oman Arab Bank and ahliBank. The prospectus can also 
					be downloaded from the IPO website www.nawras-ipo.com or 
					from the website of the Capital Markets Authority – 
					www.cma.gov.om.<br>

					<b>The Oman Capital Markets Forum was an excellent

					<br>
					<br>
					The Oman Capital Markets Forum, organised by OITE 
					Conferences, was held under the patronage of HE Yahya bin 
					Said Al Jabri, Executive President, Capital Market 
					Authority, on September 28 and 29. The conference which 
					explored the opportunities to establish and develop mutual 
					business relationships was an excellent opportunity to learn 
					innovative practices and challenges in the stock market, 
					discover emerging opportunities in the capital markets, 
					exchange commercial insights and network with key 
					stockholders.<br>
					<br>
					Ahmed Al Hooti, Director of the Information and Awareness 
					Department at Muscat Securities Market says, “we are 
					delighted to support such initiative and are looking forward 
					to sharing the latest updates concerning the local capital 
					markets and at the same time, to learning from experts from 
					around the region who will shed light on the region’s 
					investment growth and potentials”.<br>
					<br>
					The event has attracted much interest from the industry, 
					both in terms of sponsorship, delegation and speakers, with 
					over 150 delegates and six confirmed sponsors including 
					National Bank of Oman, Falcom Financial Services – Oman, 
					National Investment Funds Co, Oman Investment &amp; Finance Co 
					and Global Omani Development and Investment Co.<br>
					<br>
					An expert panel tackled various topics related to the 
					challenges and opportunities in Oman’s financial market. 
					Ahmed Baabood, executive chairman, at OITE, says, “the past 
					two years was a testing time for most senior executives. The 
					Oman Capital Markets forum came at an appropriate time, with 
					most recession-hit global companies edging back into growth 
					and new opportunities appearing on the horizon.<br>
					<br>
					The conference featured around more than 20 speakers from 
					around the region including Dr Fadi Khalaf, secretary 
					general of the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges (UASE), who 
					delivered the key note address on ‘Arab stock exchanges 
					throughout the difficult experience’. Other speakers include 
					Ahmed Bin Saleh Al Marhoon, director general, Muscat 
					Securities Market; Mustafa Baltaci, executive vice chairman,

				<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Al Ansari Group is 
				consolidating its operations to make the most of impending 
				opportunities in the Sultanate and simultaneously looking at 
				growth across geographies, reports Mayank Singh<br>
				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				From a humble beginning of two people and an indenting activity 
				in 1975, the Al Ansari Group has been able to diversify into 
				different verticals in the construction arena such as civil 
				contracting, electro-mechanical works, instrumentation, 
				calibration, steel fabrication, and trading of high value 
				engineering products; and has expanded operations into three 
				different geographical areas. Today the group boasts of over 
				3000 employees and 10 group companies across Oman, UAE and 
				India. <br>
				<br>
				“Timely diversification and converting the opportunities into a 
				viable business over the last 35 years have significantly 
				contributed to our great success. A lot of this success can also 
				be attributed to the continuous focus on developing the Al 
				Ansari brand and the Al Ansari family culture,” says Yusuf 
				Esmailji Nalwalla, joint managing director, Al Ansari Group of 
				companies.<br>
				<br>
				For most companies the primary objective of building a strong 
				brand is to “fence off” the competition and increase marketshare. 
				Al Ansari has tried to build a brand that invokes a sense of 
				trust and reliability amongst clients and all its stakeholders. 
				The key to building such a brand image is the fact that it 
				ensures that customers are treated with respect, they receive 
				high quality products and services and that the execution 
				process is an enjoyable experience. The organisation is built on 
				the same principle of employing and training a team which can 
				provide products and services that benefit the customer and meet 
				their expectations. Says Kiran Asher, group managing director, 
				Al Ansari Group of Companies, “I take pride in the fact that we 
				have established a reputation of being a company which is known 
				to fulfill its commitments and deliver at any cost and under any 
				circumstance.”<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				</font><font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><b>Riding the wave<br>
				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				The company has benefitted from the overall development of the 
				Sultanate’s economy. Says Nalwalla, “Over the last decade the 
				construction 
				</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">business sector has grown in several fold. The 
				government of Oman has made massive strides in developing the 
				infrastructure of the country. Several infrastructure projects 
				such as road works, pipeline works and sewage treatment plants 
				have been completed all across Oman and many such projects are 
				on the anvil. Such initiatives by the government not only 
				benefit our business but also give a boost to the economy which 
				in turn fuels growth across sectors.” <br>
				<br>
				Oman’s economy is buoyant and poised for growth. The government 
				plans to spend on several infrastructure projects and this would 
				directly help businesses in a positive manner. Al Ansari is 
				strategically aligning its resources to take on the business 
				opportunities that are on the anvil. The group is focusing on 
				growing its trading business unit and the civil works division. 
				Says Asher, “We have decided to consolidate our group companies 
				under one roof and build a corporate office in Ghala. The 
				development of this building is already on its way and we plan 
				to complete it by early 2011.”<br>
				<br>
				The group has also spread its wings geographically. Apart from 
				the Sultanate it has operations in Dubai, Chennai and Bangalore. 
				In the UAE it has a landscaping and electro-mechanical 
				contracting company called Akar. Within a short period Akar has 
				been able to establish itself as a premier landscaping company 
				in the region. Apart from this, it also has a company called 
				Kimoha in Dubai which is a leader in manufacturing and marketing 
				of paper products and labels. In Bangalore it has established Al 
				Ansari power technology which provides electro-mechanical 
				solutions. In Chennai it has set up JSK ltd which supplies and 
				installs high-end engineering products in the building industry.<br>
				<br>
				The Al Ansari logo amplifies the brand image fostered by the 
				company. Says Nalwalla, “the colour red signifies the vitality 
				that we possess and exuberate. It also symbolises that we are 
				sensitive to the ongoing trends in the market and are constantly 
				looking to implement and promote innovations that are required 
				to have the cutting edge. The fort signifies the commitment we 
				as a company wish to extend to our valued customers and the 
				strong character of encompassment and strong protection. It also 
				symbolises that our clients can feel secure with us and that 
				they trust us to deliver products and services that are of high 
				quality standards.” The two ‘A’s imply that Al Ansari is an A 
				grade company and its employees take pride in being part of such 
				an organisation. The square engulfing the fort exhibits the 
				“fair and square” dealings that it practices with its customers, 
				suppliers and employees.<br>

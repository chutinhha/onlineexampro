					</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Because of her exemplary 
					services for the comprehe-nsive development of all sections 
					of Omani society. A university professor, Dr Sharifa was 
					appointed as the Minister on October 22 in 2004. Since then 
					she has been actively involved in the efforts of the 
					Ministry of Social Development to provide basic community 
					and family services. Sharifa believes women are key players 
					in ensuring sustainable development and in shaping their 
					communities and families.<br>
					<br>
					The Ministry of Social Development carries out technical and 
					research studies and operates projects and pilot schemes in 
					various social fields with the aim of promoting community 
					development, providing people with the tools and knowledge 
					to enjoy more productive and fulfilling lives. The Ministry 
					prepares social welfare plans and programmes for families 
					and individual citizens, frequently backed up by material 
					assistance. It takes steps to improve the housing, economic 
					and social conditions of families on social security and 
					involves the government and non-government sectors in an 
					increasing number of development and social projects in 
					cooperation with various state authorities. The Ministry of 
					Social Development employs a highly professional team of 
					more than 160 experts and administrators to fulfill a range 
					of functions, including research into social trends and 
					developments, interviewing families applying for social 
					welfare and conducting regular home visits where necessary.<br>

					<b>Oft-quoted saying</b><br>

					woman editor of Oman News Agency also known as ONA – the 
					most important news agency in the country and the official 
					channel for news about the Sultanate.<br>
					<br>
					Zamzam graduated from Sultan Qaboos University and worked as 
					a teacher of English before moving to the Ministry of 
					Information, where she held a range of positions. These 
					included several stints in the Oman TV as a news 
					broadcaster, chairperson of the news and advertising 
					department and then marketing. Her effective contribution in 
					the establishment helped her to become the Director-General 
					of Oman TV 2.<br>
					<br>
					From a television presenter and broadcaster to the helm of 
					the country’s most important news agency, it was a 
					qualitative leap and a different experience for Zamzam but 
					she is excelling in her present role.<br>
					<br>
					The spread of news to the public has undergone a great 
					metamorphosis with the emergence of new information channels 
					and this is the challenge that information providers face. 
					However, ONA under Zamzam has risen to the occasion.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Comment about women</b><br>
					Women are now seen in all sectors of political, economic and 
					social spheres. Similarily, Omani women have made a name for 
					themselves in the media both at the local and regional 
					levels<br>

					OER’s listing of the Most Powerful Women in Business and the

					editorial team reached out to various industry leaders 
					asking them to suggest names of the Most Powerful Women. <br>
					A comprehensive list was drawn up based on these 
					suggestions. This list was deliberated upon by a team of 
					senior editors from UMS and a final listing was arrived upon 
					after consensus by the editorial team.<br>
					<br>
					<b>The following parameters were used for the process:</b><br>
					The position occupied<br>
					Length of experience<br>
					Contribution to the organisation and society at large<br>
					Visibility<br>
					Ability to influence others<br>
					Respect amongst peer group<br>
					Leadership<br>
					Courage to take decisions<br>
					Integrity<br>
					Ability to drive change<br>
					Motivating and encouraging others<br>
					Empowering others<br>
					Humility<br>
					Innovation and generating new ideas.<br>

					Sunil Fernandes, Fatma al Araimi, Mysaa Said al Hinai, Deepa

<b>US fuel consumption dips in 2006<br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="gcc9.jpg" width="150" height="219" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">High fuel prices may be curbing America’s thirst for oil, or so it seems. As per 
the American Petroleum Institute, the US oil industry’s main trade group and 
lobbying arm, the country’s petroleum use fell in 2006 for the second year in a 
row. Airlines burned 2.8 per cent less jet fuel. Factories and utilities stopped 
using residual fuel oil for power and switched to natural gas. To be sure, not 
everyone consumed less. Drivers bought more gasoline and diesel in 2006 than in 
2005. But gasoline use grew just 0.8 per cent, well below the 2 percent annual 
increases seen earlier this decade. The statistics support other recent data 
showing that the soaring oil prices have had an effect – albeit an uneven one – 
on consumption.<br>
<br>
Some sectors of the economy have had an easier time adjusting than others. Much 
of American industry switched from natural gas to oil several years ago, when 
gas prices were soaring, but switched back last year when natural gas prices 
fell, said institute economist Ron Planting. Truckers, however, couldn’t stop 
delivering freight just because diesel prices jumped. “Even if the cost of fuel 
goes up, you can’t just say, ‘We’re not going to get you your groceries after 
all,’” he said.<br>
<br>
Some energy economists pin the relatively modest growth in gasoline use on 
price-shocked drivers cutting back on trips. Others say consumers are buying 
more-efficient cars. “There seems to be a trend away from the big SUVs, and not 
just for the fuel issue,” said Dan Sperling, director of UC Davis’ 
Transportation Institute. “The SUVs were the 1990s.”<br>
<br>
Interestingly, US President George W. Bush, who acknowledges a link between 
rising temperatures and mounting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, pulled out in 
2001 from Kyoto (UN’s Protocol for fighting warming beyond 2012) under which 
most industrial nations have capped emissions.<br>

<b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CC3300">Online fraud costs Swedish bank US$1.4 mn<br>
<br>
</font>
</b><font face="Verdana" size="1">In perhaps the biggest ever phishing attack, at least 250 customers of 
Sweden based Nordea Bank lost their savings totalling US$1.4 million. The 
hackers used a phishing email that advised bank customers to download a “spam 
fighting” programme called ‘raking.zip’ or ‘raking.exe’ that loaded what 
security companies are calling the haxdoor.ki Trojan. Obviously the phishers 
have a sense of humour in calling the software ‘raking’ – for they not only 
clearly intended raking in the cash, they succeeded in doing so to tune of over 
US$1.4 million.<br>
<br>
Haxdoor is a keylogging programme that records the keystrokes you make when you 
type in information on your keyboard, and hides itself from traditional 
anti-virus programmes. The Trojan activated itself once users visited the Nordea 
bank website, which then redirected users to a fake Nordea home page, making 
visual verification of the correct site impossible. Once the log-in details were 
entered, they were sent to US and Russian servers and then harvested.<br>
<br>
The malware waited until customers tried to log into the online banking service 
of Nordea, displaying an error message asking the customer to re-enter their 
data. Once this was done by compliant customers, the crucially sensitive login 
details were sent to the Russian hacker servers for later use in stealing funds. 
Police in Sweden have already arrested over 100 middlemen in Sweden, who it 
would seem were working with the Russian hacker criminals.<br>

</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
</font>
</b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Indonesia is contemplating to offer 30 new oil and gas blocks this year. The 
new blocks are mostly in the deep waters of Papua and Nusa Tenggara and will 
come along with a package of incentives for investors. R. Priyono, the energy 
ministry’s director for the upstream oil and gas industry, said the blocks would 
be offered through a regular tender and direct offer mechanism, scheduled to 
start in May or June.<br>
<br>
By way of incentives, Priyono said companies could return their exploration 
rights to the government if they consider their areas unpromising after 2-3 
years of exploration.<br>
<br>
Priyono also said the government would announce in February the results of 20 
tenders held in August 2006. Blocks put up for tender at the time are in Madang, 
South Mandar, Sageri, and South Sageri, all off the South Sulawesi coast; 
Enrekang, onshore in South Sulawesi; and Karama, Malunda, and Mandar, off West 
Sulawesi.<br>

<b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#CC3300">Air traffic to slow down in 2007<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) November traffic results 
showed that year-on-year international passenger traffic growth recovered to 6.7 
per cent, the highest growth rate recorded since May. International freight 
traffic growth for the same period remained sluggish at 3.1 per cent. Year to 
date, passenger traffic is up by 5.8 per cent and freight traffic by 4.8 per 
cent. The average passenger load factor remained strong at 73.9 per cent in 
November and is at 76.1 per cent year-to-date.<br>
<br>
“While year-to-date traffic growth is slower than the buoyant rates seen in 2004 
and 2005, it is in line with the long term industry average growth rate and has 
been a key factor behind the industry’s improving bottom line,” said Giovanni 
Bisignani, Director General and CEO of IATA.<br>
<br>
The Middle East remains the fastest growing region posting an increase of 18.3 
per cent in passenger traffic in November. However, for the second consecutive 
month, the rise in capacity (20 per cent) outstripped demand in that region. 
Africa recorded a 7.5 per cent increase followed by North America (7 per cent), 
Europe (6.1 per cent), Asia-Pacific (5.6 per cent) and Latin America (-2.4 per 
cent).<br>
<br>
International freight traffic in the Middle East rose sharply (17.3 per cent) 
followed by Africa (3.9 per cent). The Asia-Pacific (3.2 per cent) and European 
(1.4 per cent) sectors posted relatively low growth rates despite the 
improvement in underlying economic factors. “A positive revenue environment 
helped the industry reduce losses to just US$0.5 billion in 2006,” said 
Bisignani. “We expect traffic growth to slow in 2007. Airlines must continue to 
keep load factors high by carefully managing capacity and by finding further 
efficiency gains to achieve the US$2.5 billion industry profit that we are 
projecting for 2007.”</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><br>

Abdul Razak Ali Issa, chief executive of BankMuscat commented: “Having a 
presence in commercial banking in India through our investment in Centurion Bank 
of Punjab, we were exploring opportunities in other segments of the financial 
services sector. Mangal Keshav would be our vehicle for exposure to the high 
growth Indian securities market.” As per Morgan Stanley research, the Indian 
equity markets are experiencing one of the strongest rallies and the trading 
volumes are expected to double to US$ 3.2 trillion in 2010 from about US$ 1.6 
trillion currently. Morgan Stanley projects the Indian brokerage business 
revenues to grow to US$ 3.9 billion by 2015. The financial due diligence on 
behalf of BankMuscat was conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, India, while legal 
due diligence was done by Amarchand Mangaldas, one of India’s leading legal

<br>
<img border="0" src="business_briefs4.jpg" width="125" height="184" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">National Bank of Oman has recorded a net profit of RO30.4 million which 
surpasses the record net profit of RO20.3 million reported for 2005 by 50 per 
cent. Growth in total assets during the year saw the Bank crossing the RO1 
billion mark for the first time in its 32-year history. This growth was linked 
to the growth in deposits by RO200 million (32 per cent) and growth in net 
advances by RO162 million (30 per cent). These increases reflect a growth trend 
and are consistent with the strategy of the Bank to grow quality loans and 
deposits. The cost to income ratio of 45 per cent in 2006 was lower by 5 per 
cent as compared to 50 per cent in 2005. Non-interest income as a percentage of 
total income was 33 per cent as compared to 26 per cent in 2005. This 
improvement represents the success of the Bank’s strategy to not only grow its 
operating revenues but diversify its income sources and decrease reliance on 
increasing risk assets as an engine for growth. NBO’s CEO Andrew Duff commented, 
“The record net profit, overall growth and business efficiency combined with the 
Bank’s emphasis on customer satisfaction has led to the Bank being rewarded with 
The Banker’s Magazine Award for the Best Bank in Oman for 2006 as well as rating 
upgrades from reputed rating agencies.<br>
<br>
Core operations grew by 40 per cent in 2006 as compared to 17 per cent in 2005. 
With non-performing loans now reduced to 9.5 per cent of total loans and 90 per 
cent of these covered by provisions, the Bank has clearly moved away from its 
earlier strategy of capital preservation to one of growing its business and 
finding new and improved ways to serve its customers. The Bank has announced a 
dividend payout to shareholders as proposed by the Board of Directors of 17.5 
per cent of capital as cash dividend and 15 per cent of capital as stock 
dividend.<br>

<img border="0" src="business_briefs5.jpg" width="125" height="145" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="3"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has discovered three new oil fields. One 
field, named Budour Northeast, is located in the Birba area of south Oman. The 
other two discoveries are extensions of the Ufuq and Dafiq fields, whose 
discovery was originally announced last year.<br>
“These new fields will contribute to the sustainability of PDO’s oil 
production”, said John Malcolm, PDO Managing Director. “They have been hooked up 
rapidly to our pipeline infrastructure, adding to PDO’s production in the short 
term while delivering valuable production data for the fields’ longer-term 
development.” The Budour NE field will be appraised this year on the basis of a 
long-term production test of the discovery well and the drilling of two or three 
additional wells. But initial indications are that the field contains a 
significant quantity of good-quality oil. The discovery well revealed that the 
field, at a depth of about three kilometres, contained oil along a vertical 
distance of 67 metres. And a preliminary test showed that it could produce at a 
stable rate of 8000 barrels per day. The other two discoveries – in the north of 
the country lying at depths of about 1500 metres – are hooked up for long-term 
production testing with a view to developing them as part of the plans being 
drawn up for the earlier Ufuq and Dafiq discoveries.<br>
<br>
Dr Martin Stäuble, Exploration Director of PDO, commented: “Budour NE will join 
the Birba, Harweel and Al Noor fields as the fourth major development based on 
the south Oman intra-salt carbonate formations. It is an important discovery, 
not only because of its significant size but also because it opens several new 
avenues for exploration.”<br>

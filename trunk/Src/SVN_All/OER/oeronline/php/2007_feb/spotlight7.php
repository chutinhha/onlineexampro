an upswing. Akshay Bhatnagar reports.</b><br>
<br>
The global commercial aviation business is under tremendous pressure. Even 
though revenue has gone up from US$329 billion in 2000 to an estimated US$450 
billion in 2006 (source: IATA), net profit has gone down drastically. The 
industry last registered a net profit in the year 2000. Thereafter, it has 
registered constant losses mainly due to a slump in the US market and higher oil 
prices. In 2006, as per IATA estimates, the global aviation industry reported a 
net loss of 1.7 per cent.<br>
<br>
Contrary to global trends, the Middle East market recorded a net profit of 0.2 
per cent per annum for the period 2004-2006 (source: IATA). The ME
market holds the maximum potential for passenger and cargo traffic growth. The 
international passenger traffic in the ME region is expected to have grown by 
9.5 per cent in 2006 and is expected to continue growing at the rate of 6.9 per 
cent in the period 2006-2010, more than any other market across the world. (See 
Table: Traffic Forecast By Region.)<br>
<br>
<b>Oman – Strategic Development</b><br>
The Sultanate of Oman is among the major catalysts in the growth of aviation 
business in the Middle East. Oman, with a major thrust on tourism development, 
is emerging as an important traffic hub on the global aviation map. On the 
infrastructure front, the government of Oman is modernising its existing 
airports besides building new ones to meet the growing demand. The national 
carriers, Oman Air and Gulf Air, connect the Sultanate to most of the important 
cities in the world and with the expansion of their fleet are continuously 
introducing new routes. <br>
<br>
Major international airlines along with regional carriers and budget airlines 
are also increasing their connecting flights to Oman. Air travellers to and from 
Oman, both in the leisure and business segments, now have a number of flying 
options to choose from. This has also led to more scope for growth in exports 
and imports to boost trade in Oman. “Oman has assumed significant strategic 
importance on the regional and global aviation map. Geographically, Oman is 
strategically located, being the entry point from the Indian subcontinent into 
the Gulf,” says Ziad bin Karim Al Haremi, CEO, Oman Air. (See Steady Progress.)<br>
<br>
Mansoor Mushabech, Emirates’ Area Manager for Oman, adds, “The Oman government’s 
initiative and commitment towards supporting the tourism industry has ensured 
that the country is well connected to all key gateways and its international 
arrivals are on an accelerated growth path.”<br>
<br>
No wonder, air traffic movement at Seeb International Airport has gone up 
substantially. In the period January-October 2006, 17,368 international flights 
landed at Seeb (an increase of 17.1 per cent over the same period in 2005). 
Similarly, 17,346 flights took off, which again was 17 per cent higher than the 
corresponding period in 2005. In terms of international passengers, 1.75 million 
air travellers arrived at Seeb, which was 37 per cent higher than the 
corresponding figure in 2005. And 1.73 million passengers departed from Seeb, 
35.1 per cent more than the 2005 figures <br>

<b>National Carriers – Connecting to the World</b><br>
The major credit for the growth of aviation in Oman goes to its two national 
carriers, Oman Air and Gulf Air. Both have led to unprecedented inward and 
outward traffic in Oman by connecting the Sultanate to major centres globally 
and created huge opportunities for organisations and individuals to upscale 
their activities related to the country.</font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Gulf Air has named Swiss national Andre Dose as its Chief Executive Officer. He 
replaces James Hogan, who left last September and now heads Etihad Airways. Dose

<br>
<b>Regional &amp; International Carriers in Oman </b> <br>
Regional and international airlines have also increased their operations from 
Oman to take advantage of the growing business opportunities. Khondaker Kabir, 
Sales Manager – Oman, Etihad Airways, says, “Etihad launched its much-heralded 
daily service between Muscat and Abu Dhabi in March 2006, with a brand-new 
purpose built two-zone A330-200 aircraft. A year later, traffic figures on this 
route have increased three-fold, with a significant number of Pearl and Coral 
Zone guests making the short flight between the two capital cities.” He adds, 
“The Omani market has seen consistent growth during the past year with a 
significant increase in demand from both business and leisure travel, which 
formed a key part of Etihad’s business plan. As the Abu Dhabi-Muscat sector 
continues to grow and more visitors look to come to the Sultanate, Etihad will 
look to build on these services.”<br>
<br>
Emirates operate two daily flights between Muscat and Dubai. It also has 32 code 
share flights a week with Oman Air to Dubai. Mansoor Mushabech, Emirates’ Area 
Manager for Oman says, “Oman is an important market for Emirates. The airline 
has played a catalytic role in boosting inbound business and tourist traffic 
from Europe, Asia and the United States into Oman. Emirates connects Omani 
travellers and shippers with a 87-city strong global network via its Dubai hub. 
Germany and United Kingdom in Europe; Australia, China, Thailand, Japan and 
Korea in Australasia; South Africa, Morocco and Egypt in Africa, and Dubai are 
some of the popular destinations for Omani travellers.” Emirates plan to expand 
its business in Oman by enhancing its global network and offering new products 
and services. Emirates is also expected to strengthen its route network with the 
addition of several new gateways like Venice, Newcastle and Sao Paulo, and 
increase flight frequency and capacity on high-demand routes.<br>
<br>
Qatar Airways, one of the fastest growing airlines in the world, plans to 
operate two daily flights from Muscat from this summer. What makes the airlines 
so bullish about the Oman market? Ali Abdul Khaliq, Regional Manager-Arabian 
Peninsula, Qatar Airways-Oman, responds, “The new international airport coming 
up at Sohar will boost the aviation industry in Oman. Rapid growth in tourism in 
Salalah will encourage more international airlines to include it in their 
network. Qatar Airways-Oman will also extend its customer services by setting up 
a dedicated office in Salalah.” Qatar Airways connects more than 71 destinations 
worldwide. Its network includes Europe, Africa, Far East, Middle East, Indian 
subcontinent, GCC and by mid summer, it plans to expand its network to the US. 
Ali adds, “Qatar Airways aims to grow and add more new destinations connecting 
out of Oman.”</font></p>

Sharjah-based Air Arabia, Middle East’s first low cost carrier which is coming 
out with an IPO in the first quarter of 2007, launched its first flight from 
Muscat on October 29, 2003. Godfrey Mascarenhas, Manager, Air Arabia – Oman, 
says “We started with a thrice-weekly frequency and from April 2007 will operate 
10 flights a week to Sharjah–5 morning departures and 5 evening departures for 
maximum customer benefit. This increase has been necessitated by the steadily 
increasing demand for cost effective and safe travel.” Around the region, Air 
Arabia flies to all GCC points and Teheran. In Africa and the Middle East, it 
covers Alexandria, Luxor, Assiut, Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia, Khartoum, Amman, 
Beirut and Sana. The airline covers India with daily flights to Mumbai, Kochi, 
Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai, and Jaipur apart from four flights a week
to Nagpur. In the Asian sub-continent, Colombo, Kabul, Kathmandu, Almaty, Astana 
and Yerevan are the other destinations that it connects from Oman and in Europe 
it connects Istanbul.<br>
<br>
Talking about the airline’s Oman operations, Peter Schilter, Manager – Oman, 
Swiss say, “Muscat, with daily frequencies from Zurich via Dubai, is a smaller 
destination in the Swiss network. However, thanks to the high seat load factor 
throughout the year and excellent share of First and Business class travellers, 
it is amongst the most profitable routes for the airline. Since the introduction 
of daily flights, Swiss has more than doubled the number of passengers between 
Switzerland and Oman. In 2006, we carried around 35,000 passengers, a 20 per 
cent increase over 2005.”</font></p>

			THE BULLISH CASE FOR THE US DOLLAR</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
            <b>The rally of the dollar is having an impact on the macroeconomic 
            indicators of countries from Europe to the Indian subcontinent. It 
            also puts a spanner in the works for oil prices and the northward 
            movement of goods</b><br>
            <font color="#990000"><b><br>

            <img border="0" src="periscope.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="195" height="382"><br>
            The 
            dramatic breakout in the dollar was inevitable given the $30 plunge 
            in crude oil since mid July. In essence, the foreign exchange 
            markets have priced in a global economic slowdown and shrinkage in 
            the US trade deficit that benefits the dollar. Moreover, the 
            European Central Bank (ECB)’s Jean-Claude Trichet and the Bank of 
            England’s King retreated from their previous hawkish stance on 
            inflation and emphasised downside risks to economic growth.<br>
            <br>
            As US gasoline and jet fuel demand plummets alongwith tight monetary 
            policies and the elimination of fuel subsidies in Asia, there is no 
            reason to doubt that crude oil prices can fall below $100. It was 
            significant that not even a war in Georgia, a pipeline and storage 
            hub of Caspian Sea oil could derail the bearish momentum on crude 
            oil. This is in stark contrast to the period only three months ago, 
            when any geopolitical risk (Iraq, Niger Delta, Venezuela, US-Iran 
            nuclear threats) would instantly cause a $3-5 barrel spike in oil 
            prices.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The greenbacks rally</b><br>
            The magnitude of the dollar’s rally suggests a trend reversal has 
            now taken place. Not only did the Euro and the British pound plunge 
            beneath their 200 day moving averages, a key technical support 
            point. Commodity currencies like the Aussie dollar, New Zealand 
            dollar and the Brazilian real have all plunged in value. The 
            Australian dollar has lost 10 per cent as commodities are sixty per 
            cent of exports and the Reserve Bank in Canberra has indicated 
            economic softness will force a rate cut as early as next month, 
            removing its high yield advantage.<br>
            <br>
            There is increasing evidence that the commodities bull market is now 
            over. Commodities across the spectrum – gold, silver, corn, wheat, 
            grain, lead, nickel, copper have plunged in unison. In essence, the 
            Chindia/Peak Oil argument has proven a dangerous illusion when 
            growth slowed, demand curves shifted and commodities index funds 
            scrambled to liquidate their long positions. There is also 
            increasing pressure on the ECB to soften its hard money policy as 
            consumer confidence plunges in the Eurozone. While Trichet’s mandate 
            is to control inflation and not growth, he cannot remain indifferent 
            to the chorus of outrage in Berlin, Paris, Rome and Madrid. So 
            another ECB rate hike is out of the question as long as economic 
            data disappoints. Both the ECB and the commodities outlook suggests 
            the dollar rally will continue. A 1.38-1.40 year end target on the 
            Euro is achievable. The caveat to the dollar rally would be more 
            Wall Street banking distress, a U-turn in oil prices, a surprise Fed 
            rate cut, economic recession in the US and additional weakness in 
            housing. These can all derail the dollar bulls this autumn.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Indian connect</b><br>
            The Indian Rupee is headed lower against the dollar. The Manmohan 
            Singh government has made a serious mistake in giving wage hikes to 
            5mn government employees at a time when the Reserve Bank of India 
            had done its best to dampen inflation. This was the reason the RBI 
            had hiked the banking system’s cash reserve ratio (CRR) and repo 
            rate so aggressively since June. Inflation has now soared to almost 
            12.5 per cent, its highest level since the early 1990’s. A wage hike 
            now adds to the fiscal burden on the eve of a election the Congress 
            could well lose because inflation causes incumbent parties to lose, 
            the lesson of the opposition Bharatiya Janta Party’s victory in 
            Karnataka.<br>
            <br>
            The RBI has no choice but to hike interest rates even more to offset 
            the fiscal largesse. Another repo rate and CRR rate hike is now 
            inevitable. After all, the RBI’s seven per cent target inflation 
            rate is impossible without significant monetary tightening. 
            Inflation can well rise to 14 per cent as prices of pulses, spices, 
            diesel, liquid petroleum gas and fruits are still moving higher. 
            Meanwhile, the Sensex can easily fall to 10,000 as global fund 
            mangers sell Indian shares. Industrial production has plunged from 
            10 per cent last summer to five per cent now and bank credit growth 
            will fall, corporate profit margins will be squeezed and FII money 
            will flee the Indian market as global risk aversion against emerging 
            markets rise. I anticipate Indian bond yields to rise from 9 per 
            cent to 12 per cent. A wage-price spiral as India now faces the kiss 
            of death for its nascent bond market. This makes the Indian rupee a 
            compelling short, with a target of 45 rupee against the dollar by 
            October.<br>
            <br>
            Sterling has been mauled in the FX markets after Bank of England 
            Governor Mervyn King admitted to a “Chill in the economic air” and 
            predicted that inflation will fall to his target two per cent in two 
            years if the base rate remains unchanged. Britain has flashed a 
            recession SOS. The banking system is gutted after the US financial 
            crisis. The High Street is leveraged as never before in the history 
            of the realm. Gordon Brown’s public finance black hole is a 
            disgrace. Britain faces its worst recession since the early 1990’s – 
            and the Bank of England will be forced to cut rates as low as three 
            per cent next year. Sterling calls then fall as low as 1.75 by next 
            summer, when New Labour next faces the electorate. Financial markets 
            have only just begun to price a bearish scenario for sterling.

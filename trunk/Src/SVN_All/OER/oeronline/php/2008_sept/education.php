<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The growing demand for new skills sets is 
proving to be a big business opportunity for vocational training institutes, 
writes Mayank Singh</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="education.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="173" height="150">The creation of employment opportunities for Omanis has been an article of faith 
for the Sultanate’s government. If the latest numbers are anything to go by the 
efforts seem to be paying off in a big way. According to the Central Bank of 
Oman’s Annual Report for 2007 the number of Omanis working in the private sector 
increased from 114,311 in 2006 to 131,775 in 2007, a jump of 15.3 per cent. The 
number of expatriates too has grown by an unprecedented 25 per cent in 2007 to 
stand at 638,447. With the economy growing at a rapid pace (Oman’s GDP grew by 
12.9 per cent in 2007) more jobs are expected to be created in the coming years.
<br>
<br>
<b>New market demands </b><br>
The creation of jobs has been accompanied by more competition for better 
prospects. Employers on their part have become more demanding. Says Lawrence 
Alva, general manager, National Training Institute (NTI), “A realignment has 
been going on in the job market as more Omanis realise that their educational 
qualifications are not enough to get better paying jobs and they need to acquire 
the right skill sets.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="education1.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="150" height="310">This in turn is proving to be a big business opportunity for vocational training 
institutes like NTI, Polyglot Institute, Oman and Khimji Training Institute (KTI). 
Most of these institutes have been experiencing good growth in the last few 
years. Polyglot grew by 15 per cent in 2007 and its student strength stands at 
4000 plus. NTI has been growing at a CAGR of 15-17 per cent. Says Jabir P O, 
manager – operations, Polyglot, “The industry has seen good growth in the last 
six to seven years.” The growth has emboldened training institutes to invest in 
bigger premises and better facilities. NTI which was constrained for space at 
its Madinat al Sultan Qaboos (MQ) outlet, shifted to a new location in Al 
Khuwair in 2008. The Al Khuwair centre will have 16 classrooms compared to nine 
at MQ. The institute beefed up its geographical spread by opening a new centre 
at Sohar in 2007 and Ghala in 2006. Alva explains, “The Sohar Centre offers a 
full range of courses like IT, business skills, technical and commercial skills. 
The Ghala Centre offers technical training, HSE (health, safety, environment) 
and driver training.”<br>
<br>
Polyglot is investing RO1.4mn in building a new premise at Wattayah. The 
institute expects to shift into the new building in the next six months. The 
shift will help the institute offer better facilities like counselling cubicles, 
library etc to its students. “In the long term this business will grow and we 
are investing with a long term mindset,” says Jabir.<br>
<br>
KRT has seen its teaching faculty’s strength go up from 10 in 2006 to 20 in 
2008. The institute has been growing by 28-29 per cent this year and has doubled 
its business over the last three years. Says Nadeem Ahmed, manager, KTI, “We 
have grown not only in the local market but are also undertaking industrial 
workforce training in Qatar and Pakistan.” KTI is not the only company which is 
eyeing foreign markets. NTI set up a training centre in Qatar on August 1, 2007. 
It is working with reputed companies like Shell in Yemen and Babco in Bahrain. 
“We see it as an upcoming market,” says Alva. In a number of cases companies 
which have worked with institutes in Oman, have been keen to extend this 
partnership to countries within the region. <br>
<br>
<b>Improved methods</b><br>
<img border="0" src="education2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="150" height="312">The quality of training being imparted is getting more sophisticated as archaic 
teaching aids give way to improved methods. Says Jabir, “The delivery modes have 
changed, so instead of merely using teaching aids we use audio video methods, 
interactive CDs, and power point presentations to create a friendly course.” 
Institutes have been quick to tie-up with internationally acclaimed 
organisations. For example, Polyglot is an affiliate of the International House 
World Organisation, a network of over 140 language schools worldwide. It is also 
an approved centre for ACCA and CAT computer based examinations. KRI has tie ups 
with the Royal Institute of Private health to provide HACCP certification, NIIT 
for Oracle and Microsoft courses. NTI operates New Horizons Computer Learning 
Centre (NHCLC) an international franchise with 300 worldwide centres. It is a 
Microsoft gold certified partner, an extension of Oracle University in Oman. <br>
<br>
Most vocational training institutes are flexible enough to customise courses to 
suit the varying needs of customers. Thus NTI’s NHCLC is the first centre in the 
Middle East to launch Mentored learning in 2007. Says Alva, “The training 
solution (mentored learning), provides the flexibility and convenience in terms 
of timings and pace to the learners. The method provides targeted training, 
focused and completely customsied to a learner’s needs.” In a mentored learning 
course there can be six different students doing different things at varying 
levels of a course. The approach suits companies as they can send people at 
different times. A pre-test is conducted to determine the stage at which a 
person is in terms of training and the instructor then prepares a plan to suit 
the candidates need. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="education3.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="150" height="314">There are instances wherein institutes have set up temporary facilities to cater 
to the demands of a particular company. KTI customised its IT courses to suit 
the needs of clients like BankMusat and Bank Dhofar. Polyglot built a workshop 
and 20 classrooms in Sohar to train 1300 workers from Sohar Aluminium in various 
skills like machinery, electrical, welding etc over 45 days before the smelter 
commenced production in June this year. Vocational training institutes pride 
themselves as partners in the nation building process. Says Ahmed, “We see 
ourselves as playing a socially responsible role and are not just an institute 
for profit.” KTI is a partner of the ministry of manpower’s National Project to 
train Omanis in various sectors like retail, shipping, hospitality, accounts and 
training.<br>
<br>
As the market gets globalised, small time training is giving way to 
international standards. The skill sets required in the market has evolved from 
language and IT skills to job and interpersonal skills. “Employees are looking 
at good communication, management and team skills,” says Alva. <br>
<br>
<b>Roadblocks on the way</b><br>
Despite the growing popularity of training, there are still a number of 
challenges faced by vocational training institutes. While the bigger companies 
are ready to spend money on training its staff, most small and medium 
enterprises are still to wake up to the need for training their staff. Says 
Alva, “It will require a big mindset change for them to start spending on 
training, it is happening but very slowly.” On an individual level there is a 
reticence to spend more than a certain sum of money on training. Says Jabir, 
“Every time we think of increasing the fee there is a backlash.” This is 
surprising as the fees charged by most institutes are quite competitive. 
Polyglot for instance charges RO210 for a two and half month English language 
course. NTI’s fees averages around RO100 per month. Despite these pressures most 
institutes are confident about the future prospects of the industry. </font></p>

<b>HE Nasser Khamis Al Jashmi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Oil and Gas is 
a man whose world view has been shaped by myriad influences, writes Mayank Singh
</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="person.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="250" height="248">According to the latest figures from the Ministry of National Economy, oil and 
condensate production in the Sultanate rose to 112.28 mn barrels at the end of 
May 2008 from 107.66 mn barrels at the end of 2007, a rise of 4.3 per cent. The 
production of oil in the Sultanate has been declining since 2000-01 and the 
ministry of oil and gas (MOG) has been making efforts to stem the tide. If 
recent figures are any indication then the efforts of the ministry seem to be 
paying off in a big way. <br>
<br>
The number of companies operating in the oil and gas sector has risen from 10 to 
over 35 between 2004 to 2008. This is the result of the MOG’s efforts to attract 
investments in the oil and gas sector. The MOG has been working on a major 
revamp of its organisational structure. The effort is to identify people for 
suitable roles, chalk out their training needs and to take them through the 
process so that they can fulfill their potential. <br>
<br>
A common strand running across these initiatives is H E Nasser Khamis Al-Jashmi, 
Undersecretary, Ministry of Oil and Gas. Appointed by a Royal Decree on February 
1, 2003 he has played an important role in the efficiencies that have been 
brought about in the oil and gas sector in the last four years. Says Jashmi, “I 
came in during a period when the sector was going through a lot of challenges, 
but since His Majesty had reposed his faith and trust in me, I was keen to prove 
myself worthy of this responsibility.” The foremost challenge facing the oil and 
gas sector was to arrest the decline in oil production. With most oil fields 
reaching maturity the old ways of drilling oil were no longer effective 
predicating the need to move to newer techniques. The MOG in association with 
the Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) decided to move from primary production 
techniques to secondary ones. Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods were applied 
at the Harweel, Qarn Alam and Marmul oil fields. Companies were pushed to 
optimise production. “Production stabilised last year and we hope to make some 
improvements this year,” avers Jashmi. <br>
<br>
<b>Been there done that</b><br>
Having cut his teeth in the government at the ministry of finance (MOF) Jashmi 
is no stranger to challenges. In 1998 when oil prices hit an all time low of 
$11.91 per barrel (adjusting for inflation this was lower than the price of oil 
in 1946), he was the director general (DG) for budget at the MOF. “I had to 
submit a budget which was sustainable in trying circumstances and learnt a lot 
from that experience.” Starting his career as a finance researcher at the office 
of the deputy prime minister for finance and economic affairs in 1989, Jashmi 
soon rose through the ranks to become a DG in 1997. It was at the MOF that he 
had his first brush with the oil and gas sector as he became a board member of 
Oman LNG and the deputy chairman of Oman Refinery Company. “The MOF is a 
learning hub as every project in the Sultanate whether it pertains to education, 
health or infrastructure needs finance. So just by being at the finance ministry 
one gets a fair view of what is happening all around.” <br>
<br>
Jashmi’s appointment to the MOF was a straight fit with his educational 
background. In 1985 he won a scholarship from the government to pursue a four 
year bachelor’s degree in economics and political science at the Jordan 
University. In 1991 he was chosen to be a part of a World Bank Development 
Programme in which 20 officials from various ministries were sent to the US for 
higher studies. As a part of the programme he got a masters degree in applied 
economics from the American University in Washington DC, he also went on to do a 
higher diploma in development management. Says Jashmi, “Apart from the knowledge 
gained from learning, I learnt a lot by living in two countries with contrasting 
cultures.” Having gone out of Oman at a young age of 17 years, he found himself 
being shifted from a protected environment to the rough and tumble of managing 
things on his own. The process of going through ordinary chores like acquiring a 
license or getting insurance gave him a new perspective making him a more 
disciplined person. These experiences have shaped his world view. <br>
<br>
A firm believer that an organisations goals can only be achieved by team effort 
and not by individual brilliance he says, “A good leader should create a team of 
leaders.” In line with this philosophy, he believes in delegating authority with 
accountability. “It stems from ones personality whether one wants to get into 
the details or reposes ones trust in other people.”<br>
<br>
<b>A family man <br>
</b>
<img border="0" src="person1.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="200" height="425">At home though he has to change his hands-off approach to a more hands-on 
role. As a father he is ends up taking his family out on weekends, buying things 
for his children and planning vacations. In Oman, Salalah remains a favourite 
family getaway, largely because of the relief that it provides from Muscat’s 
summer. Having been to Australia lately, he has come back with fond memories 
about the country and its people. Switzerland though remains an all time 
favourite. Ask him about what he likes about the destination and pat comes the 
reply, “Everything.”<br>
<br>
Apart from travelling he enjoys reading books related to history, religion and 
politics. Self- esteem (books that help to develop oneself) is another genre 
that he likes to get into. Having studied in the US he has developed a taste for 
Hollywood movies. Jashmi counts Gladiator and Braveheart to be amongst movies 
that he has enjoyed in the last few years. The larger than life canvas and 
historical plot of these movies seem to have struck a chord with him. Coming to 
music he is not too choosy and is game to listen to Arabic and English music.
<br>
<br>
Looking back on the influences that have shaped him he fondly remembers his 
father Khamis Ali Al Jashmi. “He taught us how to respect others, honesty and 
the right value systems.” A person who got educated at a time when not many 
people went to school or college Khamis went on to travel to Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, Bahrain and East Africa in the course of his work. A well read and well 
travelled man he groomed his children with all his experience. And Jashmi has 
gone on to become a worthy son of a worthy father. </font></p>

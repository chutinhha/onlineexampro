<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Having carved a niche for itself with its ERP 
solutions, Towell-take solutions is looking at strengthening its market position 
with its latest offering TIMICSnXg writes Mayank Singh</b></font><br>
<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="tech.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="250" height="301">Jawad Sultan Technologies (JST) has just awarded Towell-take solutions (TTS) the 
contract to install an ERP (enterprise resource planning) solution for its 
company. Says G Gopalakrishnan, CEO, JST, “When it comes to ERP solutions TTS 
has the most cutting edge solutions in the market.” Goplalakrishnan is echoing a 
sentiment shared by companies and organisations like Al Maha Petroleum, Telecom 
Regulatory Authority (TRA), Muscat Securities Market, National Mineral Water, Al 
Nasser Tiles etc, which have tied up with TTS for using its ERP solutions 
package – TIMICS. <br>
<br>
TIMICS is a state-of-the-art business software solution designed to help an 
organisation run efficiently. It helps in defining business parameters and 
accommodates changes in the work environment to compete in an ever-changing 
market. An Oracle based business software solution, it is an integrated 
management information and control system. A 22-year old evolutionary history in 
which various enhancements were added to the original package, TIMICS is today 
one of the most extensive and through business systems in the market. In 
addition as it is designed specially for the Middle East region, its supports 
its unique language and business characteristics. Apart from Oman TIMICS has 
been well accepted in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and India.<br>
<br>
TTS has recently launched the new version of its ERP solution – TIMICSnXg. Built 
on the Oracle 10g platform, it boasts of a three-tier architecture, web based 
application and 55 new features like auditing, improved error handling, 
management dashboards and extensive drill down reports. Says Dr Anchan C K, Vice 
President, TTS, “For any company looking at a financial package we should be the 
first choice.” TIMICSnXg has been developed on the 4D approach – discover, 
design, deployment and delight. <br>
<br>
<b>On firm ground </b><br>
The upgrade has a number of factors going for it. In a dynamic business 
environment companies are on the lookout for information and the challenge for 
any software solution is to offer this to customers. TIMICSnXg makes information 
available anywhere and that too at the shortest possible time. In TTS parlance 
this is known as CM2 an acronym for capture, manage and move. The software 
captures information, manages it and gives it to the customer so that he can 
move ahead in his business.<br>
<br>
Being a locally developed product, it is tailor made for the requirements of the 
Sultanates market. In the ERP market, any business process change of a company 
usually leads to a change in the software partner. TIMICSnXg’s core module can 
be customised to suit the specialised needs of customers doing away with any 
disruption. <br>
<br>
Finally, it offers an end-to-end solution for companies. For example the asset 
management and asset tracking features of TIMICSnXg can help a company like 
PepsiCo to keep an account of its various chillers and coolers in the market and 
this information shows up on the ERP system. <br>
<br>
<b>Feature heavy </b><br>
<img border="0" src="tech1.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="194" height="195">TIMICSnXg is built on the best security platform using the adaptability of CMMI 
Level 5. It provides the flexibility to meet changing business needs of any 
organisation. It is a bilingual, sophisticated and powerful ERP-business system 
which enables an organisation to have multiple divisions and multi-organisational 
structure.<br>
<br>
Let’s take a closer look at some of its features. The three-tier architecture 
means that there is an application server, a data base server and the client. 
The application server takes care of things such as general ledger, payables, 
receivables etc. The database server manages the entire application process and 
all this resides in a single server. Thus the client can log onto the browser 
and access the information from anywhere. “Irrespective of whether you are in 
Oman or in Jordan, a customer gets access to his sales figure, the day-to day 
developments and what is pending at the click of a button,” says Anchan. The 
three-tier architecture thus takes care of all the core features of any 
financial module. <br>
<br>
TIMICSnXg uses insight a tool which breaks down information to the minutest 
details. For example total sales of a company can be segregated by region, 
product type, value, country, supplier etc. TTS borrowed this feature from Take 
Solutions, its partner, based in Chennai, India. Insight is used by blue chip 
Indian companies like ITC, Dabur, Parle. A drill down option allows variables 
like sales to be broken down to the lowest measurement unit like kilolitres, 
grams etc. Says Anchan, “This dynamic analytical tool gives companies the 
wherewithal to analyse their data.” <br>
<br>
TIMICSnXg also comes with a number of user friendly options. For example a 
person does not have to change between multiple screens to shift between 
functions. If one is working on an HR page and wants to go to check out purchase 
details, he does not need to close the HR page and then open the next one. One 
can go to the next page by merely clicking on that user page icon or name (just 
like a yahoo or a Google home page).<br>
<br>
TIMICSnXg, is a clear win in the ERP market with a third party application 
integration facility giving customers a one-stop solution. This ERP could be a 
backbone on which any other module can be integrated. The success of TIMICS was 
largely due to the fact that being an open structure it fit into multi-segment 
requirements of a client. TIMICSnXg boasts of seven core modules and the rest as 
business processes giving one an integrated environment. The objective is to 
have one process wherein any other add-ons can be plugged in. This latest 
generation of TIMICS stands head-to-head with international packages in quality 
and accuracy. Says Anchan, “Our aim is to meet business requirements of today 
keeping in mind the business needs of tomorrow along with investment protection 
and rapid ROI.” <br>
<br>

Company brings together deep domain knowledge and a focus on providing vital 
solutions for successfully running an enterprise in today’s fast changing world. 
It blends its intimate knowledge of the vertical to offer TIMICSnXg ERP, supply

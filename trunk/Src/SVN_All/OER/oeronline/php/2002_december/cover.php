                    healthy profit with a limited local customer base&nbsp;</b></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is no doubt that the
                    major players in the fiercely competitive fast food market
                    are battling hard to keep their share of custom within Oman
                    and remain profitable. Pizza Hut, KFC and McDonald's may
                    have successfully expanded their businesses but they remain
                    guarded about their profits. There is a general consensus
                    within the local industry that the restaurant business has
                    slumped in the past few years. Some operators privately
                    complain that they are starved of custom.&nbsp;<br>
                    &quot;The market appears to be too small for so many brands.
                    The main trend in recent years has been one of fewer brands
                    with a greater number of outlets competing for the same
                    customers,&quot; says Abhilash Patel, Marketing Manager for
                    Khimji International LLC, the local franchisee for Pizza
                    Hut.<br>
                    Apart from affordability of fast food products and the
                    Sultanate's sporadic population density, a convenient
                    lifestyle is partly to blame for the unhealthy state of the
                    local market. Workers' extended hours for lunch and the ease
                    of reaching home within this break time have contributed to
                    the fewer number of customers reaching for a menu other than
                    on special occasions. With many workers leaving late from
                    the office during weekdays in Oman, restaurants also feel
                    the pinch at evenings. Indeed, most business is clearly
                    transacted during weekends but much of this is still
                    perceived as a family treat rather than a convenient dining
                    option.<br>
                    <img border="0" src="../../images/2002_december/24-1cover.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="169" height="200">The
                    international fast food franchises have to compete with the
                    region's king of snacks - the shwarma (a rolled sandwich
                    traditionally with lamb, chicken or vegetable filling).
                    Shwarmas sell for 200 baisas at food stalls across the
                    country and are extremely popular among locals, other Arabs
                    and Asian expatriates. Taco Bell struggled to shift Mexican
                    tacos for one Omani rial while their Arabian equivalent was
                    being scoffed at street kiosks for one-fifth of the price.&nbsp;<br>
                    Taco Bell disappeared from Oman's fast food market rather
                    pitifully, and sadly so have a few others like Wendy's,
                    Pizzaland and Burger King. But, despite these casualties in
                    recent years and all the difficulties faced by the industry,
                    McDonald's and Pizza Hut have more growth lined up. Each has
                    plans to introduce at least two more outlets in the country
                    by 2003. Cynics would suggest that this is being done to
                    simply satisfy franchising agreements, but company officials
                    say that there is much more to this strategy than boosting
                    the brand.<br>
                    &quot;We've had excellent growth. All our sites are
                    profitable and our total turnover in 2002 has so far risen
                    over 20 per cent from last year,&quot; says Ali Kamal Daud,
                    Oman's development licensee for McDonald's. He is planning
                    to open another restaurant this month in Al Khuwair next to
                    the Shell service station. &quot;There is a lot of potential
                    for us. So far we have focussed on the capital area to form
                    a strong base before moving to Salalah. Sohar, Ibri, Buraimi
                    and Nizwa are also possible future locations but with
                    perhaps some modifications to the size of the restaurant we
                    would open.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
                    Patel of Pizza Hut Oman says, &quot;We are planning to open
                    two more restaurants next year. We still have some concerns
                    about our Al Khuwair and Medinat Qaboos outlets. We are
                    looking at perhaps merging the two operations or introducing
                    a larger restaurant in the area to take care of dining
                    facilities and keeping another for the delivery
                    business.&quot; Pizza Hut currently has 15 restaurants
                    across the country. There are 10 restaurants in the capital
                    and five in the interior locations including Salalah, Sur,
                    Sohar and Nizwa.&nbsp;<br>
                    Although Pizza Hut has new plans to beef up its operation,
                    it has also decided to get leaner in the past six months
                    developing smaller outlets into bigger restaurants and
                    closing two out-of-town restaurants altogether. &quot;The
                    strategy is to consolidate our current network,&quot; says
                    Patel. &quot;Earlier we wanted to be focused on home
                    delivery, but now we think that local people are looking for
                    more of a fun experience so our priority is to give our
                    customers bigger dining areas and creche facilities.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
                    Other fast food chains indicate restructuring is also the
                    main order of the day.&nbsp;<br>
                    &quot;We don't have plans to open any new stores next year
                    and we will not consider opening stores outside of the
                    capital area until there is a broader knowledge of the fast
                    food market,&quot; says V.S. Naik, Baskin-Robbins' Oman
                    Manager. A streamlining initiative in 2000 has already
                    snipped two loss-making stores from the premium ice cream
                    chain bringing the number of shops in the country down to
                    seven.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>'Shwarma syndrome'</b><br>
                    Subway, a well-known but new global sandwich franchise which
                    entered the local market last year, has gallantly grown to
                    four shops, all in Muscat. Many in the industry have
                    concerns about Subway's fiscal performance despite its
                    novelty and rapid expansion.&nbsp;<br>
                    Kaizer H., Marketing Manager, Al Burj Trading and Consumers
                    LLC, which manages Subway for the Royal Guard of Oman,
                    shrugs off any vulnerability in the market by saying the
                    chain enjoys a strong brand equity. Indeed, he doesn't rule
                    out further expansion, saying: &quot;We need to cater to
                    giving more convenience and this can only be achieved by
                    creating additional outlets to allow easier access to our
                    stores.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
                    He does, however, concede, that affordability is becoming a
                    major challenge. &quot;Perhaps you can get five shwarmas for
                    one of our sandwiches but they cater more towards the mass
                    market while our products serve a luxury segment.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
                    Price is not the number one reason for visiting McDonald's,
                    according to Daud. &quot;In our customer survey, price is
                    rated lower in importance as compared to friendliness,
                    cleanliness, service, value and quality of the
                    product,&quot; he says. &quot;We've set a price that is
                    acceptable to anybody. We have a hamburger that sells for
                    200 baisas, a cheeseburger that sells for 300 baisas. Both
                    of these products can compete with a shwarma and you are
                    guaranteed cleanliness, hygiene and an excellent service at
                    our restaurants.&quot;<br>
                    Many open food stalls are located on busy streets in Oman,
                    and hygiene standards on offer are poor. A few months ago,
                    300 outdoor shwarma stands faced a crackdown by Dubai
                    Municipality's Public Health Department to ensure that they
                    sold food which was free from contamination. No such
                    initiative has been issued locally.</font></p>

                    reigns when it comes to identifying which fast food chain
                    commands the highest share of the local market as official
                    economic data within the industry is unavailable. No single
                    fast food business in Oman was willing to feed OER with
                    financial statistics, particularly profit or loss accounts,
                    which could be a sign of difficult times.<br>
                    &quot;Our industry is very competitive. The less the
                    competition knows about us, the more of an edge we maintain.
                    They are free to make their estimates but we will not be the
                    ones to volunteer information to them,&quot; says Daud of
                    McDonald's Oman.<br>
                    A reliable industry source estimates that the average weekly
                    turnover spent on restaurant food in Oman is RO183,600
                    (US$477,360). This equates to around RO9,547,200 (US$24.8
                    million) spent on dining out in the industry each year. The
                    fast food market approximately swallows slightly over 55 per
                    cent of this suggesting that it is worth around RO5,250,960
                    (US$13.6 million).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Don't get mean, break even</b><br>
                    Fast food restaurants may specialise in dishing out meals
                    instantly, but they're a little slower when it comes to
                    raking in profits. Andrew J. Sherman, author of Franchising
                    &amp; Licensing: Two Ways to Build Your Business (Amacom,
                    1999), explains that most fast food restaurants break even
                    within six months to two years. In Oman, the break even
                    period seems to be upwards of two years which is perhaps a
                    reflection of the industry's weakness.<br>
                    Daud of McDonald's Oman says, &quot;The cost of opening a
                    new restaurant varies but it is on an average around
                    US$500,000. Typically, we will recoup our investment a
                    maximum of four years.&quot; He confirms that he has
                    recouped start-up investment in all his restaurants that
                    have been open for four years and more.&nbsp;<br>
                    Each restaurant is different and will have its own recipe
                    for profitability. If you're running a franchise and want to
                    predict how soon it will break even, Sherman says to take a
                    look at item seven of the chain's Uniform Franchise Offering
                    Circular. This is a phone-book sized document that
                    franchisers must provide to franchisees which includes
                    projected costs to open the restaurant. Those who are
                    operating fast-food restaurants that aren't part of a
                    franchise chain will have to work up these costs on their
                    own.&nbsp;<br>
                    To determine when you'll turn a profit, you'll need to
                    figure out when the restaurant's total sales will start to
                    exceed the startup costs, as well as your month-to-month
                    expenses. &quot;The sales at a given franchise unit are
                    going to vary based on location, the food you serve, and the
                    competition,&quot; notes Sherman. &quot;I'd say if you're
                    not breaking even within a year or two you've got a problem
                    with the franchise system itself, with your locations, or
                    your management of your costs.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
                    Smaller franchises such as Baskin-Robbins, which require
                    around US$150,000 of start-up investment per store
                    (excluding promotion expenses during the launch) do not fare
                    any better with the average break even around four years
                    also.&nbsp;<br>
                    &quot;There is a danger that certain businesses will cut
                    corners if they feel they are under pressure to grow the
                    franchise. But they will find it difficult to cheat on food
                    quality without customers realising that this is the case.
                    In terms of staffing, hygiene and other procedures, they
                    could reduce such standards if the business was not so
                    good,&quot; warns Kaizer H. representing Subway in Oman when
                    asked about the spot checks that take place to monitor if
                    local development partners are abiding to a franchise's
                    rigid standards.<br>

                    <b>Serving suggestions</b><br>
                    Drive-thru is an important aspect of the McDonald's
                    experience worldwide and in Oman with so many vehicle
                    owners, it has been a major factor in its success. &quot;The
                    reason McDonald's Oman doesn't do home delivery even though
                    it may generate additional revenue is that we would lose
                    control of the quality of our product. We can guarantee hot
                    and fresh over the counter or through our drive-thru but
                    this will not be the case when it is home-delivered,&quot;
                    says Daud.&nbsp;<br>
                    For home delivery, Pizza Hut has a dedicated call centre
                    which was established in 1995. During peak hours of
                    operation, 13 employees staff it. &quot;The quality of our
                    bilingualism at the call centre has been a major success. We
                    get very positive feedback and we're proud to say we have
                    some very good Omani telephone operators,&quot; says Patel.<br>

                    The burger chain, aiming to rediscover the formula that made
                    it one of the world's best-known brands, warned of a profit
                    shortfall and announced the closure of more than 175 outlets
                    last month.&nbsp;<br>
                    &quot;McDonald's will not at all pull out of Oman nor any
                    other Gulf State,&quot; said Ricarda Ruecker, Director
                    Marketing and Communi-cations for McDonald's Middle East, in
                    an exclusive interview with OER. She refutes any claim that
                    the company's announcement will have an effect on operations
                    in the region.&nbsp;<br>
                    &quot;I can assure you that there will be no country closing
                    in the Middle East. All GCC countries are 100 per cent owned
                    and operated by Arab entrepreneurs. The owners are
                    developmental licensees and McDonald's Corp. has no
                    ownership in these countries. These countries will not be
                    affected at all,&quot; she explains.<br>
                    Ruecker emphasises that the McDonald's business will
                    continue and the developmental licensees, including Ali Daud
                    in Oman, will open new restaurants according to their plans
                    and based on market research. McDonald's have announced
                    several openings for 2003 in the GCC including three new
                    restaurants in Kuwait, three in the UAE and another one next
                    year in Oman. Locally, McDonald's employs over 100 people.&nbsp;<br>

                    <b>Profits to go?</b><br>
                    Many outstanding franchise area development opportunities
                    exist in the Sultanate. Aside from the fast food chains that
                    have disappeared and want to re-connect in Oman, many fast
                    food companies are looking for agents to establish a
                    foothold in regional countries. For example, an
                    international chicken and seafood franchise called Popeyes
                    is currently looking for a partner in the Sultanate. It is
                    looking to receive a master fee of US$45,000 per restaurant
                    along with an ongoing Royalty Fee of 5.0 per cent of gross
                    sales payable every month.&nbsp;<br>
                    Patel of Pizza Hut Oman, does believe there is only a slim
                    chance that new competitors will arrive in the market.
                    &quot;I would like to believe that we couldn't be challenged
                    in the pizza business but without being too complacent there
                    is a possibility that new entrants could arrive.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
                    Locally, there are many other threats confronting the fast
                    food industry. For McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut a key
                    challenge may be to be first to find new site locations.
                    Restaurants will also have to cope with aggressive marketing
                    tactics from one another. The potential of new competition
                    from coffee shops such as Starbucks and Costa Coffee in the
                    local market remains to be seen. Convenience stores such as
                    Shell Select, BP Express and Al Maha's Souq are already
                    doing significant takeaway food business. Discounts and
                    promotions from all of these players are certain to eat into
                    the margins of fast food chains.<br>
                    Of course, another clear danger is that Oman may lose its
                    appetite for fast food chains because of links to obesity.
                    It's perhaps more likely that the industry could take more
                    knocks from consumer protests as an indirect result of
                    political decisions. Brands took a beating between April and
                    June of this year when there was a widespread Islamic
                    protest against companies of western or American origin.
                    Although the companies targeted are global, the franchises
                    are locally owned and operated. This meant that local
                    businesses, local employees and the local economy were,
                    ironically, worse affected by such measures. The industry
                    reports that sales are back on track within the Sultanate
                    but it is easy to understand why fast food restaurants in a
                    number of Middle East countries will be anxiously studying
                    the geo-political situation in 2003.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Invaluable tips:</b> Right from calling the shots, trusting staff, 
            remaining objective and defending one’s team all these and many 
            other issues have been dealt with ease and precision by the author. 
            A new job’s pitfalls and precautions to be taken as well as good 
            listening and speaking skills that are essential to make one’s point 
            without seeming too aggressive or inattentive can be honed by the 
            invaluable tips from this communication specialist. Body language of 
            the listener is as important as the pitch and tone of the speaker. 
            He advises the ‘three tactic approach’ to communication and warns 
            speakers to “prune away fluff”. Mapping out what has to be said in 
            advance is essential.<br>
            <br>
            He cautions new managers – motivation of employees is not just 
            linked in monetary terms but depends on highly varied and individual 
            factors such as attainment, power, independence, belonging, respect 
            and equity and hence to be dealt with accordingly. Dishing out 
            criticism when it is absolutely warranted towards those who report 
            to you and dealing with errant workers without making it personal; 
            is as creatively put by Stettner as is the positive aspect of 
            motivation.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Time Management:</b> Some simple skills such as time management to get 
            oneself organized with prior lists, guarding one’s private time, 
            banishing time wasters, conquering anticipatory dread and handling 
            exhaustion which is inevitable on the job front there are tactics 
            used to handle all these plus simple issues from filing to tidying 
            desks to avoid any loss of valuable time. Meetings which are an 
            inevitable part of every manager’s life can be made one hundred 
            percent beneficial if prior agendas are fixed, circulated and stuck 
            to at all costs if one knows how to handle different personalities.<br>
            <br>
            Managers can learn that true empowerment comes from delegation 
            discussed in Chapter 10 where Stettner has said new managers need to 
            outgrow micro-managing every step of the way. They need to find ways 
            to delegate to the right people and communicate and monitor well all 
            through the follow up instead of doing things which other people are 
            in effect being paid to do. He has outlined steps to use in case the 
            job doesn’t get done properly as planned and never to take recourse 
            to self-enhancement bias.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Boss handling:</b> Ultimately the real challenge every manager faces is 
            - how to handle his own boss? Indeed the tips on how to keep the 
            boss in good spirits are to be professional, staying in tune with 
            your personality and thorough with your job, a fact well pointed out 
            by Stettner. And the under promise- over deliver tactic is commonly 
            used by all. However he has tackled it differently by analyzing 
            various types of bosses and their demands. All in all he concludes 
            keeping the boss apprised of your progress and maintaining open 
            lines of communication can ensure you get due credit for your 
            efforts.<br>
            And finally the fact that mangers do intend to move on eventually 
            without too much ado. There are tips on networking and when one does 
            land the job of one’s dreams you start all over again as a new 
            manager and a new one takes over from where you left! With this 
            reality and especially if there is no mentor on hand to guide you 
            along, the new manager’s new job rests firmly on the skills learnt 
            and applied from this wonderful new book published by McGraw-Hill. 
            Even housewives, freelancers and teaching professionals can greatly 
            benefit from this book making it a useful resource in educational 
            institutions as well.</font></p>

            <b>Excerpts from the book<br>
            </b><br>
            <b>‘Use’ your employees – without making them feel used</b><br>
            New managers sometimes let the rush of authority go to their heads. 
            They suddenly feel awash with entitlement. They start to view 
            themselves as special, different, superior. They may exempt 
            themselves from standard rules of decorum, such as saying ‘please’ 
            or ‘thank you’.<br>
            <br>
            For example, I met a marketing manager, Wes, who was six weeks into 
            his new position. His bosses couldn’t understand how Wes had 
            faltered so fast. He had alienated his employees by imposing all 
            kinds of crazy edicts, ranging from an absurdly rigid dress code to 
            having them log their day’s work in 15-minute increments on 
            elaborate reporting form that he designed and distributed. The staff 
            was verging on mutiny. <br>
            <br>
            Wes wasn’t a villain. He had just lost his bearings. As he put it 
            sheepishly to me, “I guess I got carried away by this whole thing. 
            Being in charge brings out another side of me even I don’t always 
            recognize. Sometimes I think my people are tools to be used to get a 
            job done, and I forget they ‘re actually human beings.”<br>
            <br>
            I advised Wes to settle down, draft a management credo, and make 
            corrections in his leadership style. Even though his employees saw 
            him as a micromanaging tyrant, the truth was he had lost his 
            confidence and overcompensated by tightening his grip over his 
            staff. <br>
            <br>
            Even if you keep your ego under wraps as a new manager, you must 
            still find a way to harness your employees’ talents to maximum 
            effect. Put crassly, that means using your employees to make you 
            look good. Put not so crassly, it means working together to make the 
            whole group look good because all employees and their manager are 
            succeeding. The effective manager does this wisely and with full 
            buy-in of employees, rather than exploiting them shamelessly and 
            then hogging the credit for their hard work.<br>
            The best way to use employees is to get everything into the open. 
            Let them know how they’re being used. That’s right: make it clear 
            what you want from them and why their performance matters. These 
            phrases may help:<br>
            <b>- As a result of your work, we will be able to…<br>
            - I’m asking you to make a larger contribution by getting the 
            following work done…<br>
            - Here’s a way for us to use your skills more effectively…</b></font></p>

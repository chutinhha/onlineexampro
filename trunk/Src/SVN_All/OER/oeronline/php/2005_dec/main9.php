Jack confidently states, “Greater levels of performance and achievement are 
attainable by everyone. Yet most people have never learned the proven 
self-empowerment tools and time-tested performance strategies that are the basis 
for personal and professional success.” <br>
<br>
Over his 30-year career, Jack Canfield 
has developed the specific methodology and result-oriented activities required 
to help participants take on greater challenges and produce astounding results. 
Jack’s Ten- Step Action Plan shows exactly how to plan for and achieve more . In 
fact, it’s a blueprint for living a life of expanded results, greater impact and 
more measurable on-the-job performance. <br>
<br>
“Whether your organization needs to 
increase sales, boost income, increase output, expand creativity, enhance 
problem solving, find more balance or improve customer service — these 
disciplines, when put into practice, will create massive and permanent changes 
in the lives of your participants and in the day-today operations of your 
organization,” says Canfield.<br>
<br>
During this conference, participants will learn many skills, including how to 
take 100 per cent responsibility for their lives, decide what they want, be 
willing to pay the price and how to invest every day in developing their 
knowledge base and core skills.<br>
<br>
In this exciting new programme, ‘The Success Principles’ will leave participants 
excited about the potential they have for their careers, their companies, their 
personal lives and their success goals. <br>
<br>
More than just a motivational 
experience, this programme offers the actual methods, strategies, activities and 
exercises participants need to achieve, what they want...and what you as a 
company or professional association<br>
want for them!<br>

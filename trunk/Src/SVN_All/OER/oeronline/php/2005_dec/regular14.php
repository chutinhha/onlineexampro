    Asia, the premier event in Asia on the business of media and advertising, 
    which took place in November this year, raised the intriguing issue on the 
    intense battle of the print and Internet media. While the Internet media is 
    growing at a scorching pace, print media is losing in readership and 
    advertising revenue. Going by the joint study of the Interactive Advertising 
    Bureau (IAB) and Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC), the global Internet 
    advertising revenues this year are going to cross US$12 billion - well above 
    last year’s record total of US$9.6 billion. <br>
    <br>
    The staunch supporters of the Internet media, including OER believe that the 
    continued strength in Internet advertising reflects in part the medium’s 
    unique ability to reduce the business cycle for advertising, marketing and 
    branding, making it more attractive for traditional advertisers. Even the 
    traditional media brands are resorting to promoting themselves on the 
    Internet to salvage their dwindling fortunes. No wonder the Internet stocks 
    are at an all time high. Google leads the pack with its shares hitting 409 
    recently (after a low of $168 earlier) and Yahoo! Inc. touching close to $43 
    in November-end (after a low of $30 in the last 52-week period).<br>
    <br>
    Perhaps it’s time that traditional media companies take a cue from the 
    philosophy of Mongol ruler Genghis Khan who believed that “those who build 
    fortress will lose, those who move on to conquer new territories will win”. 
    With traditional media business, especially print, not expected to grow <br>
    significantly in the years to come, it’s time for them to move on to the new 
    media without <br>
    abandoning their existing fortresses to enjoy the fruits of the high growth 
    media sectors. <br>
    <br>
    Many media companies, instead of formulating strong business growth 
    strategies to address the changing dynamics of the media market, are 
    resorting to futile and knee jerk reactions. Case in point is the growing 
    trend of dumbing down and aping tabloids. But this compromise strategy aimed 
    at hooking the new generation is backfiring as the print media brands are 
    not getting very successful in tempting the youngsters who prefer the new 
    media. Moreover, the change in content strategy is leaving the older readers 
    feeling dissatisfied with the transformation. <br>
    <br>
    As per the statistics of Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC) in the US market, 
    newspapers show a 2.6 per cent decrease in average weekday circulation and 
    3.1 per cent decrease in Sunday circulation year on year as of September. 
    The scenario is so grim that of the country’s 20 largest daily newspapers, 
    only two sold more copies in the six months through September than they did 
    in the same period a year before! <br>
    <br>
    We tend to assume that the younger generation doesn’t have print reading 
    habits. But that’s is not the case. Instead of blaming youngsters for 
    dwindling readership, the print media should understand that it needs to 
    give compelling content to them. Take the example of Harry Potter series. In 
    this new media age, how do you explain the record-breaking sale of millions 
    of Harry Potter’s 600-page books the world over if youngsters are losing 
    their interest in consuming print media? <br>
    <br>
    On the media front in Oman, the Sultanate has taken a quantum leap in the 
    growth of media sector as the government approved the licensing of private 
    TV and radio stations for the first time. The decision came after His 
    Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said approved a new broadcast law allowing private 
    ownership in August 2004. More applications are under consideration.</font></td>

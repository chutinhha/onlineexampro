Al Bustan Palace, Intercontinental Hotel, Oman has played host to several world 
dignitaries in the past, offering them an ambience befitting their style, taste 
and personality. But on December 10, it will not have much to do to create the 
right air. For, Jack Canfield, who will be the toast of a special seminar here, 
is globally famous for creating an ambience of his own wherever he goes.<br>
<br>
The motivational speaker, trainer, writer of bestsellers and renowned speaker, 
is all set to enthrall the audience in Muscat. A large number people from across 
the world vouch to have benefited from Canfield’s “hail positive spirit” theory. 
Depressed top-notch corporate executives, directionless youths, and victims of 
fatal illnesses like cancer. He enlivens all of them with his peppy pro-life 
talks. For those who believe in him, he is simply “positive spirit personified.”
<br>
<br>
Unarguably, Canfield is today America’s leading expert in the development of 
self-esteem and human potential before anything else. His inspirational talks 
are considered to be the igniting force for latent energies within a human 
personality and it is effective especially for those who are at low ebb mental 
state. This explains why his seminars have been such big hit with the audience 
in all corners of the globe. <br>
<br>
Canfield’s persona of an inspirational speaker has also been enhanced by some of 
the bestsellers, which he has authored. He has written over 15 books. Some of 
his bestseller titles are: Chicken Soup for the Soul: 101 Stories to Open the 
Heart and Rekindle the Spirit, Dare to Win, The Aladdin Factor; and How to Ask 
For and Get Everything You Want. Of these, Chicken Soup for the Soul alone has 
sold over 14 million copies. <br>
<br>
Canfield has been equally effective with his popular audio-video training 
programmes like Self-Esteem and Peak Performance, How to Build High Self-Esteem 
and STAR: Success Through Action and Responsibility. Of these, the last 
programme was specifically meant for corporates and has been making waves the 
world over. That he has corporate clients of the stature of AT&amp;T, Domino’s 
Pizza, G.E. Capital, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Monsanto, and Virgin Records among 
others speaks volumes about his ability to infuse new ideas into the corporate 
mindset. <br>
<br>
However, Canfield has not restricted himself to making use of this expertise for 
the mainstream people only. He has chalked out some unusual training modules for 
people who feel alienated from the main current of life - for groups like 
prisoners, terminally ill individuals and young men and women who simply have no 
idea of what to do with their lives. His GOALS training programme and 
inspirational talks have been found to be quite effective with these groups. <br>
<br>
No wonder then that this former alumnus of Harvard University and the University 
of Massachusetts has been one of the most watched personalities on television 
shows. He has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, The Caryl and Marilyn Show, 
Talk Soup, The Today Show, CBS Evening News, The NBC Evening News, and the BBC. 
He has been an equally popular orator for several radio programmes as well. <br>
<br>
Canfield has devoted his entire life in promoting training programmes to 
disburse that quintessential element of positive attitude in life and has been 
in the forefront of such voluntary organizations like Board of the Foundation 
for Self-Esteem and Advisory Board of the National Council for Self-Esteem in 
the United States. <br>
<br>
On the 10th of December, it will be the turn of Omanis to listen to and 
understand a man who has become one of the greatest living symbols of positive 
attitude to life. Can you afford to miss it? <br>
<br>
Capgemini Telecom &amp; Media in France (Capgemini) is the gold sponsor of the Jack 
Canfield Seminar organised by ORDC. The event is being held in association with 
Oman Economic Review. The other sponsors for the events are Nawras, L&amp;T Oman, 
OCS Infotech and L&amp;T Electromech.

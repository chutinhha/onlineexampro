            forecasts gold to rise above $1,000 on Asian demand<br>
            <br>
            </b>Newmont Mining Corp., the world’s largest producer of gold, says 
            the price of the precious metal may rise to more than $1,000 an 
            ounce in the next five to seven years as demand growth driven by 
            Asia outstrips global supply. <br>
            <br>
            The gold market “is hot and it is going to get hotter,” Denver-based 
            Newmont’s President Pierre Lassonde said in an interview on 
            Australian Broadcasting Corp. television. “By early next year you 
            are going to see $525 and down the road even a lot higher than 
            that.” <br>
            <br>
            Gold for immediate delivery touched $500, the highest intraday price 
            since December 1987, as Japanese investors bought bullion to hedge 
            against inflation and jewelers in Asia and Europe stocked up. 
            Lassonde’s prediction surpasses a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. forecast in 
            July that gold may rise to $725 by 2010 because of rising demand 
            from China. <br>
            <br>
            Gold may top a record $873 during the next three years.</font></p>

            Xbox is not a money-maker yet<br>
            </b><br>
            Microsoft Corp., the world's largest software maker, loses at least 
            $153 on each Xbox video game console it sells, based on just the 
            cost of components and assembly, iSuppli Corp. analysts said.<br>
            <br>
            Parts such as processors and manufacturing cost $552.27 for every 
            machine that retails at $399, El Segundo, California-based iSuppli 
            said in a statement. Marketing and shipping costs aren’t included in 
            the estimates. Microsoft, which has spent more than $12 billion 
            developing its game machines, released the Xbox 360 recently, in 
            time for the holidays and before Sony Corp.’s PlayStation 3.<br>
            <br>
            Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is betting the Xbox, the biggest 
            loss-maker among Microsoft’s seven units, will help bolster sales of 
            the company’s other products to consumers. The Xbox 360 will also be 
            profitable over the life of the machine, he said.<br>
            “As we go through the cycle, the cost of the components goes down 
            significantly,” said Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest 
            Securities in Portland, Ore., who does not rate Microsoft stock. 
            Royalty fees Microsoft receives from game publishers “will grow much 
            more rapidly when the installed base of Xboxes increases,” he said.<br>
            <br>
            Microsoft replaced Intel Corp. as its processor supplier and, like 
            Sony, is relying on Armonk, N.Y.-based International Business 
            Machines Corp., which makes 60 per cent of the Xbox components, 
            iSuppli said.<br>
            <br>
            The premium version of the gaming system uses an IBM processor that 
            costs $106, according to iSuppli. Other IBM chips bring the total 
            cost of chips and integrated circuits to $340 per console, the 
            researcher said.<br>
            <br>
            Microsoft’s basic system, which sells for $299, has components that 
            cost about $310, according to Portelligent Inc., an Austin-based 
            market research company. Microsoft is relying on sales of 
            higher-margin Xbox packages, accessories, and games to make a 
            profit, Portelligent said.</font></p>

            Lego thief behind bars<br>
            <br>
            <img border="1" src="lego.jpg" align="left" width="137" height="93"></b>A 
            40-year-old man is behind bars, accused of stealing hundreds of 
            thousands of dollars of Lego sets. William Swanberg was indicted by 
            a Washington county grand jury on two counts of felony theft and one 
            count of attempted felony theft. <br>
            Swanberg - who is being held on $250,000 bail - allegedly stole Lego 
            sets from Target stores in Oregon by switching the bar codes on the 
            boxes, covering over the pricing labels of expensive sets with 
            labels from inexpensive ones, said detective Troy Dolyniuk. <br>
            <br>
            Target, a discount retailer, estimates that Swanberg stole, and then 
            resold on the internet, up to $200,000 worth of the multicoloured 
            brick sets which authorities claim he pilfered from Target stores in 
            Oregon, as well as Utah, Arizona, Nevada and California. <br>
            US postal service agents who searched Swanberg’s Reno, Nevada, home 
            had to use a 6m truck to haul away all the sets they found at the 
            residence. <br>
            <br>
            Lego’s Danish founder Ole Kirk Christiansen named the famous bricks 
            in 1934 by fusing two Danish words, “leg” and “godt” meaning “play 
            well”. <br>
            <br>
            Today, according to the company's website, children across the world 
            spend 5 billion hours every year playing with Lego bricks, available 
            in 90 different colours. <br>
            <br>
            The bricks have long transcended their initial purpose as just a toy 
            and - like Crayola Crayons or Barbie - has now become a cultural 
            symbol.</font></p>

            move to cut sugar subsidy may help its cause in WTO talks<br>
            </b><br>
            THE European Union is in the process of bolstering its negotiating 
            stance at the WTO December global trade talks in Hong Kong with the 
            proposed cut in sugar subsidy for the European sugar growers. The 
            European Union has 312,000 sugar beet farmers and the EU buys sugar 
            from European producers at $745 a tonne — three times the world 
            market price. <br>
            <br>
            For the first time in 40 years, the EU is seen overhauling its sugar 
            subsidy programme and the European sugar production would be driven 
            down by more than a third, to accommodate foreign imports. This may 
            even spell end of small sugar industries of small beet sugar 
            producers such as Ireland and Finland, and 80 of the 320 sugar 
            factories in the European Union countries may close down. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt"><br>
            The current reduction of 36 per cent will still leave the European 
            sugar price twice down from triple high price. Obviously, European 
            farmers will have to be compensated for the loss of revenue. The 
            move is primarily staged to improve the EU's negotiating stance at 
            the December WTO talks in Hong Kong.</font></p>

            post strong Q3 growth <br>
            </b><br>
            US economic growth was much stronger last quarter than initially 
            estimated as spending rose more than estimated. The gross domestic 
            product, a measure of all goods and services produced within US 
            borders, grew at a revised 4.3 percent annual rate in the 
            July-to-September period, the fastest pace since the first three 
            months of 2004, as per the US Commerce Department. The inflation was 
            also reported to be milder than first thought. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Clearly the economy had a good head of steam on it right through 
            the hurricane period,&quot; said Alan Ruskin, research director at 4CAST 
            Ltd in New York. Brian Garvey, senior currency strategist at State 
            Street in Boston of the Chicago PMI number said: &quot;Policy-makers must 
            remain on guard to prevent expectations that the rate cycle is 
            nearly over, given that they could be blindsided by an inflation 
            scare in the first quarter.&quot; The Fed has raised short-term interest 
            rates 12 times since mid-2004 in a bid to keep price rises in check, 
            but many analysts suspect the rate-hike campaign is nearing an end. 
            While the GDP report reinforced the view the U.S. economy is on a 
            solid footing, economists expect growth to cool in the fourth 
            quarter and into 2006 as the housing market starts to fade and 
            consumers pull back.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;That is one factor that will probably help the Federal Reserve 
            eventually conclude its monetary tightening cycle,&quot; said Patrick 
            Fearon, senior economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. The 
            Commerce Department report said after-tax corporate profits fell 3.7 
            percent, the largest decline in four years, after a 5.3 percent rise 
            in the second quarter. Profits were cut by $151.2 billion at an 
            annual rate because of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as insurance 
            companies made huge benefits payments and uninsured corporate 
            property was lost. The strong GDP growth was attributed to higher 
            spending by both businesses and consumers. Consumer spending 
            advanced at a solid 4.2 percent pace, above the 3.9 percent rate 
            first reported. Spending on housing grew at an 8.4 percent pace, up 
            from the 4.8 percent growth first reported, after a 10.8 percent 
            surge in the second quarter. Business spending was also robust, 
            climbing at an 8.8 percent pace, above the initially estimated 6.2 
            percent growth.</font></p>

            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getfirefox.com">
            www.getfirefox.com</a> Firefox 1.5 builds upon the success of its 
            predecessor, as a popular alternative to Microsoft Internet 
            Explorer, to deliver an improved browser with significant 
            performance and usability upgrades, security and privacy 
            enhancements, promising best-in-class support for web standards, and 
            greater customization options.<br>
            <br>
            “With dozens of enhancements, Firefox 1.5 will draw many new users 
            to the improved web experience it affords,” said Mitchell Baker, CEO 
            of Mozilla Corporation. “Firefox is proof of our passion for 
            promoting choice and innovation on the web and making the Internet 
            accessible and productive. Firefox 1.5 is the easiest browser to 
            install, use, customize, and keep up-to-date and secure.”<br>
            <br>
            With Firefox 1.5, Mozilla continues its search partnership with 
            Google in America and in Europe and begins a new search relationship 
            with Yahoo! in China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. &quot;Yahoo! is very 
            pleased to enter into a strategic relationship with Mozilla that 
            enables us to offer Firefox to further extend our network of 
            products and services in four of the most rapidly-growing Internet 
            markets in the world,&quot; said Farzad Nazem, Executive Vice President 
            and Chief Technology Officer, Yahoo! Inc. &quot;By combining Yahoo!'s 
            global Internet leadership with Mozilla's innovative, easy-to-use, 
            open source Firefox web browser and our shared commitment to end 
            users, we will deliver an enhanced web experience for millions of 
            users worldwide, beginning with China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            “Firefox has connected with the global community of Web users 
            because it delivers a fast, easy, modern browsing experience”, said 
            Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. “Google continues to support the 
            growth of Firefox because of the strong alignment between our 
            mission to organize the world’s information and make it useful, and 
            Mozilla’s principled approach to developing great software.”<br>

            “Firefox 1.5 represents the tireless efforts of our global community 
            of developers and consumer advocates, who continue to work to make 
            the Web experience better for everyone,” said Baker.</font></p>

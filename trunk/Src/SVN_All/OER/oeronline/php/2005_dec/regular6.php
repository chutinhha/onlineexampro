<br>
<img border="0" src="mp3_phone.jpg" align="left" width="106" height="160"></b>For 
Korean electronics giant Samsung, which has successfully placed itself in the 
top three handset manufacturers in the world, enhancing functional capabilities 
of their phones seems to have become a key strategy. The company is now set to 
release an MP3 phone with a mammoth capacity of 10GB early next year. The plan 
to release a phone of this capacity, which will allow consumers to store a 
staggering 3000 music files, was recently revealed by Ki-Tae Lee, President, 
Samsung Electronics. <br>
<br>
By announcing a phone with this kind of memory, Samsung has moved more swiftly 
than expected. Only in October, Samsung had announced the SPH-V7900 with 3GB of 
storage space, but with the revelation of a 10 GB MP3 phone, Samsung has upped 
the ante. They have yet to disclose pricing.</font></p>

Fuelled by its ambition to become one of the top three
<img border="0" src="samsung_pmp.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="95">digital 
camera players in the world, Samsung’s R &amp; D labs are abuzz with activity these 
days, churning out new innovative digital cameras. According to an inside report 
they are well on their way to churning out a PMP digital camera. This camera to 
be unveiled next year will have the normal functionalities of a PMP like mobile 
TV and movie playback with a screen size as large as 3 inches. <br>
<br>
Samsung’s reported move will be keenly watched by market observers because the 
experiment to mix a digital camera with PMP has not been too successful in the 
past. But then Samsung has managed to turn many predictions made about it upside 
down in recent years. And, therefore, its move to create a hybrid product 
between a Digicam and PMP shouldn’t be taken lightly. </font></p>

Let’s have no misgivings about it. In the world of Gizmos,
<img border="1" src="pam_pod.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="102">no word 
commands more attention than POD after the stupendous success of Apple 
Computer’s iPOD and the recently released iPOD Nano. So while Shakespeare may 
have asked “what’s in a name”, but in market parlance a name, a branded name 
means everything. With iPODs becoming a rage all over the world, more products 
sharing the famous “POD” as the second name or surname are coming out. <br>
<br>
A prominent medical equipment manufacturer in the United States has released a 
product, which it has christened “HeartPOD” which promises to help you in 
personal constant monitoring of heart conditions. The device has two key 
elements in the form of an implanted intracardiac sensor as well as a Patient 
Advisory Module (PAM), which suggests adjustments in medical dosage at different 
points of time depending upon your heart condition. The PAM is a wireless 
component, which helps in analysing the raw data pertaining to your heart 
condition.</font></p>

are not available about the new offering, it is believed to have dimensions of 
only 14mm in thickness and will have a memory capacity of 512 MB. It will also 
have an in-built functionality for USB connectivity and MP3 features.<br>

                    HE Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al Bakri, Minister of Manpower 
                    spoke to OER on the latest Omanisation percentages. Excerpts 
                    of the interview<br>
                    <br>
                    What is the progress in the rate of Omanisation till date?<br>
                    </font> </b> <font face="Verdana" size="1">The National Manpower 
                    Seminar coupled with the joint action by public and private 
                    sector enterprises to implement the recommendations of this 
                    seminar resulted in a remarkable increase in the number of 
                    national manpower at the private sector institutions.<br>
                    <br>
                    The latest statistics show that the number of Omanis working 
                    in the private sector increased from 98,200 in 2000 to 275,751 
                    by the end of April 2009, an increase of 14 per cent year-on-year. 
                    This reflects the success of Omanisation in various sectors 
                    of the economy. As for the temporary labour force in the private 
                    sector, statistics reveal that their number stood at 170,387, 
                    as of April end 2009. Around 81.1 per cent of this workforce 
                    is males. Statistics also show that the national manpower 
                    in the private sector also witnessed a remarkable growth in 
                    terms of technical and scientific skills. Many private sectors 
                    now warmly welcome fresh Omani graduates who have the right 
                    qualification and training. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What are the major challenges in increasing Omanisation 
                    percentages?</b><br>
                    Many sectors still suffer from lack of skilled national manpower, 
                    therefore we have no option but to allow expatriate recruitments. 
                    On the other hand, many private sector enterprises pay poor 
                    salary and give few work incentives, which results in higher 
                    turnover of national manpower. Many candidates are also not 
                    willing to work everywhere in the country and prefer to work 
                    in areas close to their homes.<br>
                    <br>
                    In a bid to overcome such challenges, the Ministry of Manpower 
                    is coordinating with the private companies to ensure that 
                    Omani workers have conducive work environments and get proper 
                    incentives. We are also making endeavours to limit the competition 
                    in the market by Omanising certain professions after ensuring 
                    that Omanis can take up such jobs. The Ministry of Manpower 
                    has also undertaken a campaign under the theme “Let’s Work” 
                    to raise awareness on vocational training and technical education. 
                    We also encourage employers and employees to change their 
                    mindsets and make every possible effort to ensure the success 
                    of Omanisation. We have also initiated a number of training 
                    programmes for Omani youth to improve their skills, knowledge 
                    and quality suitable to the job market.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some sectors like oil and gas, electricity and water, banks 
                    and telecommunications have achieved high Omanisation <br>
                    rates. Other sectors such as trade, tourism, transportation, 
                    navigation, auto industry, heavy industries, IT, private education, 
                    consultancy offices and accounting professions are doing well 
                    and are in a position to achieve the specified Omanisation 
                    rates. It should be noted that the construction industry has 
                    achieved the preset Omanisation rates in the sixth five-year 
                    plan (2001-2005). The numerous development projects of the 
                    seventh five-year plan have created a number of job opportunities 
                    for the national manpower. This in turn has helped many organisations 
                    to achieve the Omanisation rates stipulated by the Ministry 
                    of Manpower.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Does deadline pressure on projects make companies to recruit 
                    expats instead of national manpower?</b><br>
                    <img src="images/img49.jpg" width="231" height="399" hspace="8" vspace="6" border="0" align="left"> 
                    As I mentioned earlier, the Sultanate is witnessing a remarkable 
                    growth in all walks of life; a fact evident from the number 
                    of ongoing projects and the growth in the number of private 
                    enterprises. This boom has resulted in high demand for expatriates. 
                    However, this should not be interpreted as ‘Omanis do not 
                    have the skills and resources to complete projects efficiently 
                    on time’. We should be aware that many Omanis play a key role 
                    in setting up new companies and managing ventures. Many of 
                    them also hold senior posts in different private sector companies.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moreover, the national manpower has made great success stories 
                    in all walks of life especially in business. Omanis now hold 
                    posts right from unskilled jobs to senior managerial positions. 
                    Many private companies are allocating resources and endeavouring 
                    to train national manpower at specialised training centres. 
                    Many private companies have also set up their own training 
                    institutes to ensure continued development of the national 
                    manpower. Many major companies allocate huge funds to set 
                    up technical laboratories and provide the colleges of technologies 
                    with state of the art lab and training equipment especially 
                    in IT and engineering fields. This highlights the role played 
                    by private companies in training national manpower.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How do the vocational training institutes meet the needs 
                    of the market? </b><br>
                    Vocational training institutes provide a number of tailored 
                    training programmes to cater to the needs of different sectors. 
                    They provide courses in electromechanical works, welding, 
                    carpentry and auto repair. Some training courses extend upto 
                    three years while some are short-term courses.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Ministry also provides a number of on-the-job training 
                    opportunities linked to employment. These training programmes 
                    are funded by the government and the graduates will join work 
                    after successful completion of these courses. The number of 
                    beneficiaries of such programmes numbered 4491 in 2008. They 
                    have been provided with the required skills that enable them 
                    to join construction, travel, tourism, communication, transportation, 
                    oil and gas and industry sectors. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What is the progress in technical education?</b><br>
                    The government attaches great priority to technical education. 
                    The Higher colleges of technologies are regarded as advanced 
                    training institutes. The technical education programme has 
                    witnessed a remarkable growth as is evident from the number 
                    of students enrolled at technical education which increased 
                    from 2,204 in the academic year 2001-02 to 6,844 in 2008-09; 
                    a 17 per cent annual growth. The number of students enrolled 
                    in technical disciplines also rose from 4,971 in 2002 to 21,450 
                    in 2009, a growth of 33.2 per cent year-on-year. <br>
                    <br>
                    The colleges of technologies have developed tremendously in 
                    terms of infrastructure, study majors, teaching methodologies, 
                    practical training and meeting the needs of the market. Figures 
                    show that the number of study majors rose from 13 in 2003 
                    to 23 in 2009; most of which are scientific and engineering 
                    majors. During the period from 2003 to 2008, seven new disciplines 
                    have been introduced namely oil &amp; gas engineering, commerce, 
                    IT, accounting, CAT, design and fashion, photography and mechatronics.<br>
                    <br>
                    During its second meeting in 2009, the board of trustees of 
                    the colleges of technology approved new specialties that include 
                    chemical engineering, petrochemicals, vocational health and 
                    safety, medical equipment engineering and insurance. The number 
                    of disciplines at the technical college now stands at 37. 
                    They play a key role in meeting the needs of the private sector 
                    companies for skilled manpower.<br>

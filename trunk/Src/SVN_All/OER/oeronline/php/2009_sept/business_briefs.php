                    fifth Breakfast Seminar was successfully conducted at the 
                    Al Bustan Palace Hotel last month. The seminar on ‘IFRS for 
                    SMEs’ brought together regulators and a range of professionals 
                    across the business community in Oman. It is a significant 
                    development for the small and medium sized entities (SMEs) 
                    and KPMG’s prompt initiative to update users through a presentation 
                    would help SMEs keep up-to-date with international standards. 
                    The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued 
                    an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) designed 
                    for use by SMEs in July 2009. The standard is a result of 
                    a five-year development process with extensive consultation 
                    of SMEs worldwide. Khalid Ansari, Partner of KPMG in Oman,

                  Information Technology Authority (ITA) unveiled its 
                  captivating new e.oman brand logo under the auspices of HE 
                  Sheikh Al Fahdel bin Mohammed Al Harthy, undersecretary for 
                  development affairs, Ministry of National Economy and deputy 
                  chairman of ITA’s Board of Directors. Also in attendance was 
                  Dr Salem bin Sultan Al Ruzaiqi, the CEO of ITA; and executive 
                  officers of several large corporations, commercial banks, 
                  marketing companies and advertising agencies. Visually 
                  aesthetic, the new e.oman brand evokes an intense reaction 
                  upon first glance. Multicoloured and dynamic, the e.oman logo 
                  constantly changes shape and colour. The centrepiece of the 
                  logo and the e.oman under the centrepiece remain unchanged. 
                  The centrepiece is the ‘Aian’ letter in Arabic, the first 
                  letter of Oman. It also resembles the capital ‘E’ in the 
                  English language, which can also stand for the ‘e’ in the 
                  electronic era. Thus, the design shows a willingness to 
                  embrace two languages – Arabic, the language of Oman, and 
                  English, the language of IT and business.</font></p>

                addressing the need to impart management education with 
                practitioner orientation and create a platform for managers to 
                practise management differently within the context of local 
                managerial environment. The school is looking at these very

                  Electricity Holding Company (EHC) and Oman Cables Industry (OCI) 
                  to cooperate in establishing the basis on which to enter into 
                  term contracts for the supply of products from the electrical 
                  supply industry to the EHC Group companies. Karl Matacz, CEO 
                  of EHC, said that the MOU will promote technology transfer 
                  from suppliers to ensure that the transmission and 
                  distribution network in Oman utilises leading global

                provides a much more efficient and stable operating platform 
                than our previous applications. Voyager supports the GTI audit

                Nawras has introduced a range of initiatives to take greater

                recycled paper bags as a replacement for the plastic bags 
                previously used. The environmentally friendly paper bags help 
                save natural resources, energy and trees, and are much easier to 
                dispose of than plastic bags. Nawras has also implemented the 
                self-service machines to reduce paper and provide easy access 
                for Ajel bill payment and Mousbak recharge, which reduces the 
                need to buy physical recharge cards.<br>

                <b>Using cycling as a mode of transportation can make you fit 
                and reduce cardiovascular risks</b><br>
                <br>
                Cycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation and optimal 
                for short to moderate distances. Compared to motor vehicles, 
                bicycles have numerous benefits including the provision of 
                exercise, generating renewable energy and reducing traffic 
                congestion.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Health benefits</b><br>
                The physical exercise gained from cycling is generally linked 
                with increased health and well-being. According to the World 
                Health Organisation (WHO), physical inactivity is second only to 
                tobacco smoking as a health risk in developed countries, and 
                this is associated with tens of billions of dollars of 
                healthcare costs. The WHO’s report suggests that increasing 
                physical activity is a public health ‘best buy’, and that 
                cycling is a ‘highly suitable activity’ for this purpose. The 
                charity Sustrans reports that investment in cycling provision 
                can give a 20:1 return from health and other benefits. It has 
                been estimated that, on average, approximately 20 life-years are 
                gained from the health benefits of road bicycling for every 
                life-year lost through injury. Bicycles are often used by people 
                seeking to improve their fitness and cardiovascular health. In 
                this regard, cycling is especially helpful for those with 
                arthritis of the lower limbs and are unable to pursue sports 
                that cause impact to the knees and other joints. Since cycling 
                can be used for the practical purpose of transportation, there 
                can be less need for self-discipline to exercise. Interestingly, 
                it has been found that despite toning the leg muscles, cycling 
                also tones the buttocks.<br>
                <br>
                <b>All round benefits</b><br>
                Cycling while seated is a relatively non-weight bearing exercise 
                that, like swimming, does little to promote bone density. 
                Cycling up and out of the saddle, on the other hand, does a 
                better job by transferring more of the rider’s body weight to 
                the legs. However, excessive cycling while standing can cause 
                knee damage. It used to be thought that cycling while standing 
                was less energy efficient, but recent research has proven this 
                not to be true. Other than air resistance, there is no wasted 
                energy from cycling while standing if it is done correctly.<br>
                <br>
                Cycling on a stationery cycle is frequently advocated as a 
                suitable exercise for rehabilitation, particularly for lower 
                limb injury due to the low impact that it has on the joints. In 
                particular cycling is commonly used within knee rehabilitation 
                programmes. As a response to the increased global sedentarity 
                and consequent overweight and obesity, one response that has 
                been adopted by many organisations concerned with health and 
                environment is the promotion of active travel, which seeks to 
                promote walking and cycling as safe and attractive alternatives 
                to motorised transport. Given that many journeys are for 
                relatively short distances, there is considerable scope to 
                replace car use with walking or cycling, though in many setting 
                this may require some infrastructure modification.<br>

                    is a huge desire in Qatar to become the leading financial 
                    services centre in the region, despite rivals like dubai, 
                    bahrain and saudi arabia who are very close</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Qatari authorities are uniquely ambitious with regards to 
                    the goal of rendering the hydrocarbons sector, which includes 
                    oil and gas, totally irrelevant to the local economy by the 
                    year 2020. Also, Qatar desires to become the leading financial 
                    services centre in the region notwithstanding rivaling places. 
                    Finance Minister Yousuf Kamal echoed these goals a few weeks 
                    ago. However, he acknowledged possible delay in attaining 
                    zero dependency on the hydrocarbons sector as a consequence 
                    of the global financial crisis.<br>
                    <br>
                    Undoubtedly, Qatar is not required to make the hydrocarbons 
                    sector utterly insignificant to the local economy. However, 
                    Qatari officials are required to make the economy diversified 
                    enough with contributions generated from different sources 
                    excluding oil and gas. At the moment, the country is overly 
                    dependent on the petroleum sector, a reality that places Qatar’s 
                    economy at the mercy of developments in international oil 
                    market. The petroleum sector accounts for three quarters of 
                    the treasury income and about the same level of total exports 
                    plus a quarter of gross domestic product (GDP).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Trying harder</b><br>
                    <b><img border="0" src="images/img80.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="237"></b> 
                    Somehow, the drop of oil prices provided Qatari authorities 
                    an opportunity to limit the significance of the hydrocarbons 
                    sector in the economy. The government prepared the budget 
                    for fiscal year 2009-2010 with an average price of $40 per 
                    barrel, down from $55 per barrel in 2008-09. Qatar’s fiscal 
                    year runs from April to March. Total budgetary income amounts 
                    to $24.4bn in 2009-10, down by some 15 per cent from the previous 
                    budget on the back of the lower oil price. Accordingly, the 
                    budget suffers from a projected deficit of $1.6bn. However, 
                    firmer oil prices over the past few months would most likely 
                    turn the projected shortfall into surplus. <br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    To be sure, the Qatari government is trying vigorously to 
                    generate revenues from different sources partly though external 
                    investments. Qatar is a global investor through its state 
                    wealth fund (SWF). By one account, Qatar boasts of a $40bn 
                    SWF. Last month, Qatar gained a voting stake at Porsche after 
                    purchasing 10 per cent of the shares held by the family that 
                    controls the German carmaker. As part of the deal, Volkswagen 
                    and Porsche will merge by 2011, thereby paving the way for 
                    Qatar to emerge as the third biggest shareholder in the company.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Growing oil output and reserves</b><br>
                    Ironically, Qatar steadily continues its efforts to expand 
                    oil production capacity notwithstanding talks about ending 
                    the significance of hydrocarbons. Sustained efforts by international 
                    oil companies notably from the US helped raise oil output 
                    from 701,000 barrels per d<img border="0" src="images/img79.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="5" width="150" height="628">ay (bpd) in 1988 to more than 1 
                    million bpd in 2005 and nearly 1.4 million bpd in 2008. According 
                    to BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2009, Qatar’s 
                    2008 output accounted for 1.5 per cent of global production.<br>
                    <br>
                    BP statistics show Qatar has proven oil reserves amounting 
                    to 4.5 billion barrels in 1988 rising to 12.5 billion barrels 
                    in 1998 and 27.3 billion barrels in 2009 thanks to efforts 
                    by international oil firms. As such, Qatar controls 2.2 per 
                    cent of proven reserves in the world. By comparison, Saudi 
                    Arabia controls 21 per cent of proven oil reserves worldwide.<br>
                    Largest LNG exporter<br>
                    More importantly, Qatar produces some 39 million tonnes of 
                    liquefied natural gas (LNG). Over the past several years, 
                    Qatar expanded its energy business through joint production 
                    agreements with international oil firms. Currently, Qatar 
                    is the largest LNG exporter in the world, a position overtaken 
                    from Indonesia not long ago.<br>
                    <br>
                    Still, Qatar’s LNG capacity is projected to reach 77 million 
                    tonnes a year by 2012. As in the case of oil, Qatar managed 
                    to develop its gas industry to extraordinary levels through 
                    joint production agreements with international oil firms. 
                    Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani opened the country’s energy 
                    sector to international oil firms ever since assuming power 
                    in his country in the mid 1990s.<br>
                    <br>
                    Qatar’s extraordinary gas sector is supported by hard facts. 
                    According to BP Statistical Review of World Energy, Qatar’s 
                    natural gas reserves stood at 900 trillion cubic feet by year 
                    end-2008, representing nearly 14 per cent of proven global 
                    reserves. In fact, Qatar ranks number three worldwide with 
                    regards to proven gas reserves after only Russia and Iran. 
                    In many respects, Qatar’s position with regards to export 
                    of gas mirrors that of Saudi Arabia with respect to oil.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Financial hub</b><br>
                    In the same interview, the Qatari minister expressed another 
                    utterly optimistic goal in the years to come, namely turning 
                    Qatar into a leading global financial centre. On a more regional 
                    level, Qatar must meet competition presented by Dubai and 
                    Bahrain. Yet, another rising rival for the crown of financial 
                    services hub will be Riyadh after the selection of Saudi capital 
                    as home of the monetary council for Gulf Cooperation Council 
                    (GCC). Of the six-member GCC, two countries namely Oman and 
                    the UAE opted not to join the monetary union project.<br>
                    <br>
                    At any rate, Saudi authorities are determined to turn Riyadh 
                    into a major centre for financial services on a global level 
                    through King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD). Construction 
                    of KAFD started in 2007 with completion of the first phase 
                    likely in 2010, in time for launch of the planned monetary 
                    union project by all GCC states except Oman. The Sultanate 
                    decided to shun the project as a sovereign decision. In fact, 
                    Saudi officials are thinking big, comparing the project to 
                    that of Canary Wharf, London’s business and banking district. 
                    The project is being developed on a site comprising 1.6 million 
                    square metres in the northern part of Riyadh. In comparison, 
                    London’s Canary Wharf is built over an area of 345,000 square 
                    metres.</font>

                <br>
                Nevertheless, Qatar stands the chance of making Doha a base for 
                financial activities related to energy in general and gas in 
                particular, rather than overall financial services. In short, it 
                is easy to see the logic behind the 2020 plan to transform the 
                Qatari economy. As suggested, the extraordinary reliance on oil 
                and gas puts the economy subject to external shocks. However, 
                Qatari authorities have to be realistic rather than idealistic.<br>

                Liberia would be the last place on anyone’s map if at all he were 
                given a choice of taking an all expense paid business trip. However, 
                Ajay Ganti, being the non-conformist that he is, did land in Liberia, 
                at one point of time, scouting for business opportunities as part 
                of his job. “I found that it were the UN airplanes which mostly 
                landed there. I am like that. While everyone else wants to go 
                to plush places like Europe, I took a different trip and went 
                scouting for business to almost all of North Africa in my previous 
                job,” says Ganti, the general manager of Al-Seeb Technical Establishment 
                (SARCO).<br>
                <br>
                Similarly, while the rest of the world admires the clean and green 
                places of the earth like the Switzerlands and the Malaysias, the 
                best place that Ganti likes is Oman itself. In fact, Ganti could 
                not help describing in detail the beauty of Oman, when asked which 
                his favourite destination is. That’s Ganti, a man who does not 
                travel the beaten path but charts his own itinerary, whether in 
                business or personal life. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Live the dream</b><br>
                “I think that the mantra to succeed in life is adaptability and 
                dynamism, even though many say it is hard work and intelligence. 
                Attitude is also important. If you have a dream, live it or at 
                least try for it,” Ganti says. Ganti’s life is a mixture of pure 
                luck, hard work and dedication. When destiny gave him opportunities, 
                he grabbed them with both hands. Hailing from south India, Ganti 
                went to college in Delhi, the capital of India and studied science 
                more due to family pressure than anything else. Although he graduated 
                in science, he soon realised that physics and chemistry were not 
                his cup of tea and realised that marketing was what he wanted 
                to do in life. <br>
                <br>
                <b>God’s grace</b><br>
                <img src="images/img63.jpg" width="165" height="100" hspace="9" vspace="6" align="left">His 
                rise to his present position as general manager of Sarco has been 
                spectacular as he had begun as a junior sales executive back in 
                India in the early 90s. His ability to learn helped him grow and 
                soon he was the regional marketing head of Sony in North India. 
                Then on, there was no turning back as his career took him to Dubai 
                and finally brought him to Muscat. <br>
                <br>
                Throughout this, job offers just landed in his lap and Ganti says 
                that God gave him all that he desired. It was as if he just had 
                to wish and divine providence would listen. “I am a firm believer 
                in God and I can say for sure that all my prayers were answered. 
                That is why whenever I have the chance I visit Tirupati (the temple 
                town in South India) to offer my vows,” he says.<br>
                <br>
                Even though he is a workaholic, he makes all out efforts to spend 
                time with his family and friends. He was a sportsman during his 
                college days and won many medals as an athlete especially in the 
                110 mtrs sprint. He also won a national scholarship for his skills 
                in playing tabla, the Indian classical percussion instrument.</font></p>

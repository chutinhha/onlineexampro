 Group CEO of Majan Consolidated Company, Anvwar Al Balushi, was awarded the fifth MENA HR Excellence Awards in the ‘HR Champion of Change’ category. The awards were given away recently at the eighth annual Human Assets Expansion Summit MENA 2013 in Dubai, in which the undersecretary of Dubai manpower authority was the chief guest. Al Balushi is the first Omani from a private sector company to receive the prestigious awards, for which 27 countries competed from the MENA region this year. Qatar Petroleum and Dubai’s security and coordination authority are the other winners of the awards.
				<br />
				<br />
 The HR Champion of Change award recognises an executive for developing HR functions, and the nominees are required to provide examples of their leadership, strategic thinking, and key decisions. Anvwar, who joined Majan in 2006, became the group CEO in 2010. Recently, he implemented changes in his company’s HR policies.
				<br />
				<br />
 Anvwar said he dedicated the award to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. “It is His Majesty’s policies which enable us to progress in our field,” he said. “I also dedicate this award to my chairman. It is he who guides me and supports me in steering the company to progress. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my employees for trusting me and working along with me for the benefit of the company.”
				<br />
				<br />
 Elaborating on the changes he made in the company’s HR policies, Anwar furthered, “Since I joined Majan, I have put in all my efforts to steer the company towards progress. From January 1, 2013, we have planned and committed to an Omanisation rate that is higher than the government’s mandate, and for the coming years, we have set a much higher target. We provide in-house training opportunities for our employees to hone their skills.”
				<br />
				<br />
 “It is easy to hire an employee,” Anwar adds. “But the challenge is to bring out their best from them for the progress of the company. I feel that my strength lies here. I hire the best and I know how to bring out the best from them for the company’s growth. It is my experience and also the guidance from my chairman, that help me to do so.”
				<br />
				<br />
 In 2012, Anvwar was nominated for the MENA CEO of the Year Awards in the ‘Revolutionary CEO of the Year’ category.
				<br />
				<br />
 He also revealed that Majan would achieve an Omanistaion rate of 47 per cent by June, 2013 and by 2014, it was planning to make it 56 per cent. The company has also committed to provide the increased salary of RO325 for their Omani employees as per the directives of the Ministry of Manpower from July 1.
				<br />
				<br />
 In 2012, the company has made 14 per cent growth and in 2013 it is expecting more. Majan Consolidated aims and continues to develop a portfolio of businesses that are major players within their respective industries, bringing together outstanding knowledge of customer needs with leading edge technology platforms to provide superior products to its customers. At present, the company has several diverse businesses namely steel manufacturing, agriculture, education, human recourses development, real estates and land bureau, publication and advertisement, trading and contracting and amusement park.&#8194;

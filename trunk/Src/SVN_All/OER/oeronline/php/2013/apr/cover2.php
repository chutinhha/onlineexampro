The leasing and finance companies also known as the non-banking financial industry has six licensed players, with a total asset size of over RO700mn and total market capitalisation of RO231mn. Few local commercial banks have also set-up retail financing and SME division on a significant scale adding to the competition in the industry, apart from the recently launched Islamic finance window of almost all the local commercial banks. In addition to these regulated financial institutions, there is substantial availability of credit from the unregulated sector. The suppliers of equipment and automobiles also act as distribution channels for finance as a measure of sales aid and backward integration.		
<br />
<br />
The financial markets in the Sultanate continued to remain stable. The money market, government securities market and foreign exchange market fall within the jurisdiction of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), while the capital market, corporate debt market and the insurance are regulated by the Capital Market Authority (CMA). As financial markets play a very critical role in financing the growing needs of the various sectors of the economy, the CBO continued to provide support to the markets within its jurisdiction. The objective is to develop deep, liquid and vibrant financial markets in the Sultanate.
<br />
<br />
Capital market in Oman remained subdued during 2012, despite recovery of the economy. Although medium term fundamentals of the economy are robust, stock market activities mostly reflected unimpressive growth of profits of the private sector and fragile global recovery. But the financial sector was the most active sector comprising almost 67 per cent of the total securities traded and 47.5 per cent of total turnover during January-September 2012 followed by the industrial sector with a share of around 19 per cent in the total securities traded and 27.9 per cent of total turnover during the same period.			
<br />
<br /> 
<b>Macro indicators
</b><br />
<br />
The macro-economic indicators continued to be favourable during the year 2012. Boosted by surging demand, oil prices continued to remain firm, enabling government to once again post substantial fiscal and balance of payments surpluses. This improved confidence in the economy, encouraging the government to announce a large number of projects, which include the Southern Express highway (second packet), the Batinah coastal road, the major expansion of Muscat and Salalah airports, the Duqm Port, a number of internal road projects in Dhofar, the Sharqiya and elsewhere in the country.
<br />
<br />
The private sector too, has risen to the occasion stepping up investment in the ‘tourism’, services, manufacturing and construction sectors. The increased economic activity, and the policies implemented by the Ministry of Manpower resulted in the creation of large number of jobs for Omani nationals and contributed to the demand for automobiles.

<br />
<br />
The banking sector continued its positive growth trend in 2012, consistent with the sustained growth of the economy. Banks remained sound, resilient and profitable due to appropriate regulatory and supervisory policies adopted by the CBO. Liquidity in this sector improved sharply, with deposits of the commercial banks exceeding the lending opportunities. Most of the banks have set up a separate SME division, and are facing similar challenges as NBFCs. 
<br />
<br />
The advent of Islamic Banking is expected to diversify banking services and expand financial inclusions. Two new banks have established their presence, and with most of the local commercial banks having launched Islamic banking, the availability of funds is likely to increase substantially.

<br /><p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">

<b>Demand is huge</b>
<br />
<br />
The demand for this sector as was seen during the last three years when the corporate segment has also seen growth which is expected to continue as the eighth five-year economic development plan (2011-2016) approved at the beginning of 2011, includes a government capital investment of RO12bn over the next five years, while the total government expenditure will amount to RO42bn for the five-year period. The enhancement in the minimum capital requirement and the increased combined net worth of this sector; create a capacity of about RO1bn in the industry. In addition to this, during the year 2013, two Islamic banks are going to be active in their operations. This excess capacity could be a constraint as the sector is unlikely to grow by 100 per cent to fill up the potential.
<br />
<br />
The retail segment also witnessed a growth in the year 2012 because of the measures, such us creation of employment opportunities, higher minimum salary, welfare benefits for the registered unemployed. The growth in this segment is expected to continue as the eighth five year plan aims to generate 200,000 to 275,000 new employment opportunities to the national workforce.
<br />
<br />
<b>Performance</b>
<br />
<br />
The year 2012 again saw Al Omaniya Financial Services retain its position as the largest NBFC in terms of asset size, profit, EPS, net worth and market capitalisation thanks to its strong fundamental ratios, in earnings, yields, assets and lowest NPAs. Muscat Finance, the country’s long-standing non-banking financial company, has reported a year of improvements in profits and uninterrupted dividends since inception with 21 per cent growth in assets and eight per cent growth in net profits.
<br />
<br />
Oman Orix Leasing Company has recorded highest profits and business volumes in its history with new business volumes increase by 24 per cent to RO69.33mn on purchase cost basis. United Finance Company recorded a good performance during the year 2012 thanks to the strengthening of its relations with vehicle and equipment dealers and cashing in on the market to grow its loan book, albeit with emphasis on asset quality. National Finance Co continued to enjoys a robust sourcing, underwriting, collection and operational model commensurate with the size and risks of the underlying asset class.
<br />
<br />
Taageer Finance Company achieved a 22 per cent growth in profit after tax of 
RO3.9mn in 2012 as against RO3.2mn in 2011, which is higher than the industry 
average of 17 per cent.<br />

<b>Source of SME funding
</b><br />
<br />
NBFCs are major source of funding for the SMEs and with the strong encouragement of government initiatives, the sector can play a significant role in the economic development of the country. The initiation of various infrastructure projects will trigger a lot of economic activities and employment generation through the trickledown effect.
<br />
<br />
Increase in oil prices, good growth in government budget, softening of interest rates and other positive factors may provide the necessary impetus for growth opportunities.  There has been higher stress on the sector to sustain the earnings ratios with the increase in nonperforming assets, shortage of talent and increase in manning costs. Another concern is the interest rate, which is the lowest at present. This may go up any time in 2013 and all companies are expected to take cautious steps to overcome this adverse situation. Companies with the sustainable business model with emphasis on higher efficiency and innovation will succeed in the long run.
<br />
<br />
<b>Opportunities and challenges<br />
</b><br />
The projected growth in the economy through infrastructure development has resulted in the demand for equipment financing while the diversification of economy to non-oil sectors (transportation, trading and tourism sector) will continue to create the demand for financing. Factors such as the government’s effort at developing a national work force, increasing employment of young Omani nationals are expected to create opportunities for retail financing.
<br />
<br />
These opportunities have made the leasing sector one of the preferred sectors which is reflected in the balance sheet build-up and bottom line profits of all the companies. However, challenges are expected to arise within the industry, thanks to the excessive supply through professionally managed NBFCs and local commercial banks apart from suppliers of equipments and automobiles. The high indebtedness of local population and resource deprived SME sector and the aggressive in-house financing by major automobile dealers are expected to have an impact on the NBFCs.
<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b>
<br />
<br />
The country’s budget envisages substantial expansion in infrastructure investments and also calls for the creation of a large number of jobs in the public and private sectors. In addition, the eighth five year planned expenditure has increased substantially. These developments are positive for our SME and retail businesses.&#8194;

Al Omaniya Financial Services (AOFS) has completed 15 years of successful operations as a non-banking financial institution, offering a comprehensive range of financial products. Over its tenure of 15 years, the company has established a strong market presence with good systems and processes and has crossed many significant milestones. It continues to demonstrate its excellence in its business strategies as a leading player in the country by offering diverse range of products and services.

The year 2012 again saw the company retain its position as the largest NBFC in terms of asset size, profit, EPS, net worth and market capitalisation thanks to its strong fundamental ratios, in earnings, yields, assets and lowest NPAs. The company’s success can also be attributed to careful planning and clear strategies, supported by sound vision and guidance by the board. In the earlier years the company has focussed on good asset growth, especially in the new product segment, with a cautious approach.
<br />
<br />
A major milestone achieved by Al Omaniya, this year, is that the company’s share market capitalisation crossed the $75mn mark, thus catapulting it into the large cap segment on the Muscat Securities Market. This is a first for the NBFC industry. The company’s loan book recorded a growth of 32.11 per cent over the last year and stood at over RO205mn at the year end. The net income grew from RO10.8mn in 2011 to RO12.5mn in 2012. 
<br />
<br />
The gross revenue during the year 2012 grew by 18.07 per cent and stood at RO17.05mn as compared to RO14.44mn in the previous year. The net interest income grew from RO10.3mn in 2011 to RO11.9mn in 2012. Though the cost of funds has come down moderately from the previous year, the spreads are lower due to comparatively low yield in the new product segments and corporates, and due to intense and unhealthy competition. In spite of the above, the company was able to register yet another record profit of RO5.65mn for the year 2012 producing earnings per share of 32 baisas on the increased share capital. There is also a 20 per cent appreciation in its share value which means the market has recognised the company as a niche NBFC.  The company has sound human resource policies and its Omanisation percentage stood at 80.8 per cent.
<br />
<br />
The competition from the well capitalised finance companies as well as the existing commercial banks will be intense and lead to severe reduction in margin and asset quality. This coupled with two new Islamic banks starting operations and directly competing in the retail segment to make their presence felt will drive margin further down and could see erosion in profitability and asset quality.&#8194;

As one of the premier diversified non-banking finance companies in Oman, engaged in providing vehicle finance and loans to SMEs, National Finance Co enjoys a robust sourcing, underwriting, collection and operational model commensurate with the size and risks of the underlying asset class. The company’s major strengths are its customer base, dealer relationships, strong business practices and experienced and committed work force. 
In 2012, National Finance raised an equity capital of RO7.5mn from its existing shareholders through a fully subscribed rights issue. The equity capital has now increased to RO25.06mn which means that the company has already achieved the 2016 target regulatory capital of RO25mn.
		
<br />

<img border="0" src="images/cover_chart_16.jpg" width="500" height="203"><br />
</center>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
On the operational performance side, National Finance has seen its income from financing activities increased by 17 per cent. The interest cost increased by 3.3 per cent as a result of increase in borrowings. Consequently, net interest income increased by 17.4 per cent to RO9.3mn as compared to RO7.9mn in 2011. The profit after tax for 2012 RO4.11mn up by 16 per cent as compared to RO3.55mn in 2011.
<br />
<br />
The company continues to adopt a conservative approach to credit approvals as a result of a perception of heightened credit risk since Q4 2008. Within this policy, the approach has been to target customers perceived to meet the company’s credit risk appetite. As a result, net finance assets increased by 17.8 per cent to RO126.69mn as compared to RO107.52mn in 2011. Overall, the company achieved a net profit of RO4.11mn for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to RO3.55mn in 2011, an increase of 16 per cent. The company has raised equity capital of RO7.5mn by issuing 75,000,000 shares to existing shareholders at par value of 100 baizas per share during February 2012. The rights issue was fully subscribed and accordingly the paid-up capital of the company has increased to RO25.05mn which enables the company to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements for the foreseeable future as per current regulations.

<br />
<br />
Preparing Omani employees for the changing environment is a strategic imperative which is followed closely within the company.

Taageer Finance Company has decided to expand its reach to potential customers with a number of new business initiatives in the coming years and increase its share in the market. The company has also achieved reduction in borrowing costs which is evident by interest costs of RO2.19mn in 2012 as compared to RO2.37mn in 2011 notwithstanding the increase in asset size during 2012.
<br />
<br />
The company achieved a 22 per cent growth in profit after tax of RO3.9mn in 2012 as against RO3.2mn in 2011, which is higher than the industry average of 17 per cent. The company’s size of net portfolio has grown by 10 per cent from RO83.66mn in 2011 to RO92.00mn in 2012.  The company has grown cautiously and achieved a return on shareholders’ funds of 14.26 per cent for 2012 as against 13.73 per cent in 2011.

Taageer holds a 5 per cent stake in equity capital of The Arab Leasing Company (TALC), Sudan, with original investment of RO578,000 and carrying value of RO636,000. TALC, Sudan has paid a dividend of RO 21,000 during 2012 while RO117,000 has been the increase in carrying value of investment, based on operating results of TALC, Sudan and foreign exchange gain arising from swap agreement entered by TALC, Sudan with Central Bank of Sudan.

<br />
<br />
The company has strengthened the human resource base during 2012 to improve customer service and enhance transactional support capabilities required to sustain growth in assets. The total number of employees has increased from 114 in 2011 to 125 as at December 31, 2012. With this, the company achieved 79.3 per cent Omanisation ratio. Meanwhile, the company will continue to impart training and support the educational needs of its employees to improve their skill levels.

<br />
<br />
As Oman’s economy grows over the next three years and as the Government boost its infrastructure and other projects spending, coupled with private consumption and investment, the outlook for economy as a whole and for leasing and finance industry appears to be bright. The competition among leasing and finance companies, is however, expected to intensify bringing the margins under pressure.&#8194;

Muscat Finance, the country’s long-standing non-banking financial company, has reported a year of improvements in profits and uninterrupted dividends since inception. The company had a very successful year in 2012 with 21 per cent growth in assets and 8 per cent growth in net profits. It has announced a cash dividend of 10 per cent and a stock dividend of 7 per cent. The year 2012 was the silver jubilee year and saw the company complete an enviable track record of successful operations over the last 25 years. With the approval and distribution of the above dividend the company will distribute a cumulative total of RO33.69mn by way of dividends against the capital of RO7.4mn injected in cash.
If you look at the break-up between the project financing and personal financing operations, Muscat Finance has a fairly distributed business over the retail and corporate/ SME segments.

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">

Earlier, car loans were the main stay of most NBFCs. But nowadays, the banks have got into this segment. But Muscat Finance has managed to cope up with this very well thanks to the superior approval turnarounds and relationships with the automotive dealers which give them the competitive edge. Muscat Finance also has a significantly large customer base built over the last 25 years and these customers come back to them for repeat business. The company therefore continues to see healthy growth in its car finance business. 

<br />
<br />
Thanks to the competitive edge, the market segments comprising of auto loans and SMEs, established over the past 25 years, continue to create profitable growth for Muscat Finance. The company is eyeing the Islamic finance market and is hoping that this will address the needs of a segment of the market and should therefore establish itself in its niche. The company is awaiting the CBO guidelines for Islamic finance to finalise its offering in this segment.

<br />
<br />
With the Oman economy poised for excellent growth, Muscat Finance foresees steady growth in the future. Challenges however exist in procuring and developing local Omani talent which has become even more important with the focus on enhanced Omanisation. It has achieved the stipulated 80 per cent Omanisation target and have implemented intensive training and development initiatives to develop Omani staff.&#8194;

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px"><br />As part of our new initiative to bring on board the leasing sector performance, OER-GBCM has commenced its annual ranking of the Best Leasing Companies in Oman starting this year. For this annual ranking process, we have considered the growth and sustainability parameters of the leasing companies in Oman (similar to our successful Best Banks ranking model with few changes relevant to the sector). The leasing companies ranking model was done among the local players which include Al Omaniya Financial Services, National Finance, Muscat Finance, United Finance, Taageer Finance and Oman Orix Leasing. We have taken financial data for the period from 2009 to 2012 to rank the leasing companies on the set parameters for Growth and Sustainability. 
<br />
<br />
The data were sourced from the published financial statements (audited) of the leasing companies. Ranking based on the growth is done by calculating the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of gross leasing assets (ex. unearned finance income), net interest income, operating profit, networth and net profit over 2009 to 2012. In our ranking model, the operating profit is calculated by subtracting total operating income with the total expenses (excluding depreciation costs). Ranking based on the sustainability factor was done by calculating the four-year average of three key factors which includes asset quality, productivity and efficiency. Asset quality was ranked based on non performing assets to the gross leasing assets (NPA/GL) ratio and the overall leasing assets provisions to non performing assets (provision coverage ratio). The productivity is ranked based on the operating profit of the company to its total number of branches and number of employees. The efficiency factor considers net interest margins (net Interest income/average interest bearing assets), cost to income ratio, return on average assets (RoAA) and return on average equity (RoAE). For the calculation of cost to income ratio, we have excluded the depreciation expenses.

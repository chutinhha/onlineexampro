					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">How was the banking sector’s performance in Oman during 2012?
The banking sector in Oman continued it’s positive growth trend in 2012 consistent with the overall GDP growth. The balance sheet of commercial banks further strengthened due to the robust growth in both deposits and credit. Total assets of commercial banks increased by 13.9 per cent to RO20.96bn in December 2012 compared to RO18.41bn a year ago. Total credit expanded by 14.4 per cent to RO 14.31bn at the end of December 2012 from RO12.51bn a year ago. Aggregate deposits held with commercial banks also registered an increase of 12.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis to RO14.2bn at the end of December 2012. The increase was broad based with saving, demand and time deposits rising by 17.2 per cent, 13.3 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively. Provisional net profits of commercial banks stood higher at RO306mn in 2012 as against RO264mn in the previous year. 
<br />
<br  />
<b>What policy measures are being taken by the CBO to strengthen the banking sector in Oman?</b>
<br  />
<br />
A key element of the ongoing financial sector reforms in Oman has been the fine tuning of the prudential and supervisory framework through developing sound risk management systems, enhancing transparency and complying with international standards and best practices. The CBO had initiated a number of regulatory and supervisory measures recently to improve efficiency of the banking system. The minimum regulatory capital was recently raised from 10 per cent to 12 per cent of the risk-weighted assets. Risk-based supervision has been introduced and covers the entire banking system. The CBO is well within the time frame for the implementation of the Basel III capital adequacy framework. The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) has been operationalised by all banks in Oman with effect from December 31, 2012. A financial stability unit (FSU) has been set up within the CBO for macro-prudential supervision of the financial system and will be coming out with financial stability reports. On the operational front, the CBO reduced the interest rate ceiling on all new personal loans from eight per cent to seven per cent with effect from April 1, 2012. Also new micro prudential norms have been introduced for personal loans. The debt service ratio has been capped at 50 per cent of net salary receipt on non-housing personal loans and 60 per cent on housing loans.

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<b>The CBO has permitted Islamic banking in Oman. How will this improve the banking industry and benefit customers in Oman? </b>

<br />
<br /> 

With regard to Islamic banking, two new local banks, Bank Nizwa and Al Izz Islamic Bank have been granted approval with the former commencing operations in December 2012. Almost all existing local banks have evinced interest in establishing windows for practicing Islamic banking with most of them already operational. The CBO is confident that the advent of Islamic banking will have a positive impact on the economy. Banks offering Islamic banking products are optimistic that they will be in a position to significantly expand their business which will benefit the economy as a whole. The inclusion of Islamic banking will add to the competitive environment, providing the customers the benefit of choosing between both conventional and Islamic banking products. 
<br />
<br />

How is the Macro-economic situation in Oman and how is it impacting the banking sector? 
During the year 2012, the Omani economy continued the growth momentum aided by high crude oil prices and sustained domestic demand, supported by large public expenditure and accommodative monetary policy pursued by CBO. During January – September 2012, the nominal GDP increased by 13.1 per cent, with GDP emanating from the hydrocarbon sector registering a growth of 11.2 per cent and non-hydrocarbon sector witnessing a growth of 13.2 per cent. The general price level remained under control with the average inflation based on CPI for Oman at 2.9 per cent compared to 4.1 per cent in the previous year. The strong GDP growth and supporting monetary and financial policies had a favourable impact on business growth and performance of commercial banks. With greater participation of commercial banks in the development process together with large investments by the government, the balance sheet of commercial banks are expected to remain healthy. Oman’s saving and investment as proportion to GDP has increased significantly during the recent years. The future of Oman’s banking system remains promising taking into account the pace of economic diversification and the role of the private sector in the development process.&#8194;

					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<b>How was Ahlibank’s performance in year 2012?</b>					
<br />
<br />
If you look at the global and the local challenges in Oman and see what we have done in the past three to five years, including the last year, we are very pleased with our achievements.  We have continued to do well in various areas of our operations and have outperformed other banks in different areas. If you look at the banks business, our commercial banking operations has done well in terms of growth. I have always insisted on the fact what is important is not just growth, but also the quality of our growth. Our NPAs are the lowest in the industry and we will try and maintain it at that level. Our return on assets is still the highest in the country although the cost of funds has become higher. Our returns per employee is the best. So if you look at most of the parameters whether they are related to profitability, efficiency or quality of assets, we are pleased to see where we are. However, we are aware of the fact that it is a challenging market and with two new banks entering the market competition is bound to grow. You will soon see our first quarter results and we hope that we can continue on the same track.
<br />
<br />
<b>You have always insisted that it is the quality of growth that matters more. Having attained a certain size, wouldn’t it be fair for you to aim higher? </b>
<br />
<br />
When you are building an institution you need to build it not just for today, but also for the future. Every institution has its corporate culture and credit philosophy and you do not change it just because you are growing. The culture has to be a part of the institution’s DNA going ahead. Yes we are a conservative bank and we are not going to water down our credit norms, just because we want to grow. Probably, we would be open to shrinking the size of our balance sheet to have better quality of assets, than just loading the balance sheet with toxic assets. So while our balance sheet will continue to grow, we will be focussed on the quality of assets that we book. 
<br />
<br />
<b>&#8207;Does this conservative approach compromise your growth prospects?</b>
<br />
<br />
It compromises on our growth prospects in areas that we do not want to be in, which is clear and we are very happy about it. Not all growth is good and if other banks are happy to take that kind of a growth, let them do it, but for us if there are areas that we do not want to go, then we will stay away from them. However, if there is a business that we are interested in then we do everything to win that business and that’s the reason for our growth. 
&#8207;Ahlibank’s proposed acquisition of Taageer Finance has been in the news. 
<br />
<br />
<b>What is the purpose of this takeover?</b>
<br />
<br />
Going forward, banks have to play a major part in the economic growth of the country, and what is being talked about in a big way now is SME development. If you see the customer profile of finance companies and the customer profile of banks, finance companies do more of SME kind of transactions and that is an area where we want to grow in future.  So Taageer would be a platform for us to expand our SME business. The leasing business also fits in very well with Islamic products, so if you mix Islamic products and the growth prospects in the SME business, it gives us a very strong platform to launch both at the same time and that is an area of growth for us going forward. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Will Taageer Finance be merged into Ahlibank or will be a separate entity?
</b>
<br />
<br />
As per CBO rules, it has to be a part of the bank. In terms of how we are going to run the merged entity, we will decide on that after doing the due diligence, as the process will tell us exactly what we want to do with the transaction. We have to understand their customer profile, quality of assets, skill sets of their staff, policies in terms of operations. Once we have the data then we can come up with a better strategy. 
<br />
<br />

&#8207;The proposed acquisition shows that you are looking at inorganic growth apart from organic growth. 
<center><img border="0" src="images/cover_chart_6.jpg" width="500" height="291"></center><br />					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">

<br />
<b>Will the bank be pursuing more such opportunities in future?</b>
<br />
<br />
Inorganic growth is very much a part of our strategy and we have been saying this earlier. If we find opportunities that fit in with our shareholder requirements then we will definitely look at those possibilities. 

<br />
<br />
<b>Have you increased your branch network and ATM presence in the last year?
</b><br />
<br />
When you increase your branch network it is meant to serve two purposes: business growth and servicing the clients better. In terms of growth in the retail business, it is not going to be as high as in the previous years on the asset side but on the liability side we see a lot of growth and our focus is on gaining low cost deposits and retail deposits. We continue to expand our branch distribution, to grow our business and to serve our clients. In February 2013, we opened five Islamic banking branches in a day and this is another area where we see a growth in our retail business. 
<br />
<br />
<b>With two new banks coming into the market, a lot of people think that Oman has too many banks. What are your thoughts on the issue? 
</b><br />
<br />
My view is that we are seeing too many banks in Oman, if you compare Oman with the neighbouring countries which have larger economies and the number of banks that they have and compare them to our economy and population, we see that we have too many banks and when you add the branches of foreign banks it adds to the pressure. Going forward I feel that there is going to be some consolidation.
<br />
<br />
<b>&#8207;The government has identified Omanisation as a national priority. Is Ahlibank contributing towards this endeavour?
</b><br />
<br />
During the last three years, there has been a 25 per cent growth in recruitment on an annual basis and most of these have been Omanis -- 95 per cent of them are graduates. They are usually from the College of Banking and Finance or other Universities.  We are a young bank and we want to recruit young talent. We help young recruits to gain skills and have a clear career path for everyone in the bank. You will see Omanis occupying very critical positions in the bank and this is growing. In Ahlibank, various departments like finance, corporate, HR, corporate communications, credit risk, treasury, Islamic banking, operations, marketing and product development are headed by Omanis. They are assisted and guided by our expatriate colleagues. The skills that they are gaining ensures that they will be very good business leaders in future. 
<br />
<br />
<b>&#8207;Looking ahead, what are your thoughts on 2013?
</b><br />
<br />
The year 2013 is going to be a challenging year for every bank and for all business houses. But I also see a lot of opportunities as the government has ambitious plans to expand the economy and going forward, we are very optimistic about our numbers and prospects.

Net interest income increased by 8.6 per cent to RO230.4mn in 2012 from RO212.1mn reported during the year 2011.

This will result in sharing information, ideas and knowledge through the ‘communities of practice’ and learning from best practices and previous projects that will result in a culture of innovation and continuous improvement within the bank.

<br />
<br />
A process of identifying and grooming branch managers was institutionalised resulting in rounded development of identified staff prior to being placed in a branch manager’s role. This resulted in reduced learning curve for 42 new branch managers who were identified through this process.
<br />
<br />
The bank provided 5,976 learning opportunities through 552 courses to its employees in 2012. The programmes helped young Omanis to pursue studies at leading institutes and qualify to assume higher responsibilities in the bank.

<br />
<br />
<b>Can you tell us about your plans in FY2013?
</b><br />
<br />
The year 2013 will be a period of increasing competition for the banking sector with the launch of Islamic banking operations, competitive channels and new products to cater to the various new and growing sectors. 

<br />
<br />
On the back of buoyant economy, Bank Muscat expects its credit growth to be around 14-15 per cent this year. The bank enjoys an edge in hi-tech products and services, including electronic payment and web-based services, in tune with Oman moving towards a cashless society and meeting the banking requirements of a young and tech-savvy generation.

<b>How has the Bank’s performance been in  the financial year 2012?
</b><br />
<br />
The year 2012 was an exceptional one for Bank Sohar as it continued to evolve and make its mark on the banking and financial landscape of Oman. Building on the previous year’s outstanding performance, the bank continued with its efforts in a number of areas of its business in 2012 -  the result of an unswerving focus on achieving sustainable growth. 

<br />
<br />
Boosted by its strong operating performance, Bank Sohar registered a net profit of RO23.011mn for the financial year December 2012 compared to RO14.497mn for the previous year, entailing a year-on-year increase of 58.73 per cent. The operating profit for the year was RO28.644mn compared to RO20.007mn in 2011, an increase of 43.17 per cent. Net interest income during the year climbed 20.53 per cent to RO 41.894mn, compared to RO 34.757mn in 2011. The operating income for the year 2012 increased by 21.14 per cent from RO43.186mn in 2011 to RO52.317mn. The cost-to-income ratio stood at 45.2 per cent in 2012, down from 53.67 per cent in2011.
<br />
<br />
Significant gains were made in other areas of the bank’s business as well. Net loans and advances jumped 12.4 per cent during the year to touch RO1,146mn, against the previous year’s level of RO1,020mn. Customer deposits grew 14.17 per cent to RO 1,337mn during the year, as compared to RO1,171mn in 2011. The overall gross loan stood at RO1,171mn as of end 2012, compared to RO 1,041bn in 2011, representing an increase of 12.49  per cent for the year.
<br />
<br />
Bank Sohar’s impressive financial performance during 2012 was in no small part the result of the continued hard work and commitment of the bank’s staff to deliver excellent service to its customers in a very competitive environment. It is through their efforts that Bank Sohar has succeeded in building customers’ trust in the establishment and this has delivered sustainable value proposition to our shareholders. These efforts were supplemented by an intensive drive by the management to improve the overall quality of its assets, enhance yield, expand business,  and reduce operating expenses.
<br />
<br />
<b>What are the measures that you have taken to strengthen your retail lending and corporate finance/project lending in the year gone by?
</b><br />
<br />
Bank Sohar has always been responsible in its lending also for retail customers. The lending focus has been mainly to ensure that the end use of funds has been for productive purposes. Bank Sohar has been continuing to grow its branch network and providing loan and deposit products to a larger customer base since inception. Bank Sohar continues to increase its portfolio of corporate finance/project lending. In the year 2012, the corporate finance/project lending portfolio increased by 16.59 per cent. In line with he huge infrastructure spending by the Sultanate of Oman, Bank Sohar continues to provide its banking services, including meeting the credit requirements of the companies involved in the various infrastructure projects in the country.

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<b>Can you share details about your branch and ATM network and is there any plan for upgrading your presence in the year ahead?
</b><br />
<br />
The bank’s branch network continued to grow in a sustained manner and totalled 25 branches by end of 2012. These branches, situated in prime locations covering every major Wilayat of the Sultanate, continue to yield fruitful results and provide customers with the convenience of face-to-face banking on demand. The bank also has an extensive network of ATMs totalling 44 machines across the Sultanate, with 25 of them in the branches and 19 ATMs located off-site. In addition, Bank Sohar customers continue to enjoy the privilege of free-of-charge access to over 650 ATMs under the ‘Oman-Net’ platform.  &#8207;For 2013 the bank will primarily focus on the launch of its Islamic banking window - ‘Sohar Islamic’ (SI). Operations will commence initially with four branches covering Muscat, Batinah, Salalah and Dakhiliya regions, but plans are in place to operate seven branches over a period of next three years with a focus on financial inclusion of a certain customer segment. 

<br />
<br />
<b>Has the bank invested in its IT platform and what kind of efficiencies has this brought about to your operations?
</b><br />
<br />
The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) available today is being effectively leveraged by Bank Sohar in customer acquisitions, driving automation and process efficiency, delivering ease and efficiency to customers. Our IT has become a key instrument in providing efficient services setting it apart from the competition. 
<br />
<br />
Major milestones were achieved last year including the successful completion and go-live of many new and customised IT applications of FY 2012. The bank’s website was also fully revised and went live in December 2012. The new website offers improved navigation and enhanced functionality to provide customers with more control when managing their finances. &#8207;During the year, we upgraded our main IT storage system SAN storage to EMC’s latest storage technology along with an online replication of the head office’s mission critical systems to a disaster recovery site. Additionally, the annual business continuity disaster recovery drill was successfully conducted in November 2012. The process demonstrated that even in the event of a complete failure of its main data centre; the bank is capable operating without any serious disruption of its key services. 

<br />
<br />
Among the other notable achievements during the year 2012 was the successful implementation of the in-house developed ICSI – Internal Customer Satisfaction Index application on December 5, 2012. The bank also successfully developed and implemented an in-house application for IPO collection.  
<br />
<br />
<b>What are the measures taken by the bank to improve its HR practices?
</b><br />
<br />
The Human Resources department continued its vital role of providing well trained employees to all parts of the Bank and to ensure that they perform to their full potential regardless of their function. The Bank continues to use the best available training sources and methods to achieve this vision. &#8207;As part of this strategic direction, developing leaders for the future was identified as one of the key initiatives for 2012. To hone the leadership skills and competence of the bank’s managers, a talent management and leadership development program was introduced. The 12-month, seven- module ILM (Institute of leadership & management) certified programme, concluded with 32 senior and middle managers being awarded a diploma in management and leadership.  

<br />
<br />
In addition, we continued to comprehensively train our employees to enhance their skills and competencies on an ongoing basis.  Last year, the bank organised 306 training programmes which provided 2,471 open spots for employees to attend. Of these, 193 programmes were conducted by the Training Centre at the bank’s in-house learning centre, thereby making training more cost effective and job relevant. Additionally, the bank sponsored 11 young Omanis for further education in banking studies at CBFS. 45 members of the staff were also sent overseas for training purposes to specifically meet their education requirements, since these programmes were not available within the country.&#8194;

					<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<b>&#8207;How was Oman Arab Bank’s (OAB) performance in 2012?
</b><br />
<br />
In 2012 we increased our capital from RO106mn to RO116mn. This was done to fund our Islamic banking window. During the year our net profit increased by nine per cent, from RO23.2mn to RO25.15mn; total assets by 23 per cent from RO1.114bn to RO1.370bn. Our portfolio of loans and facilities increased by 13 per cent from RO829mn to RO934mn; deposits increased by 13 per cent from RO909mn to RO1.031bn and our capital adequacy rose from 13.4 per cent to 17.2 per cent. So all in all it was a heartening performance.    
&#8207;The bank seems to have grown in various areas. 
<br />
<br />
<b>What are the factors accounted for this growth?
</b><br />
<br />
We are increasing our portfolio and lending facilities, mainly for big projects and industrial ventures. Simultaneously, we are looking at increasing our portfolio by being involved in trade and project finance. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Can you name any big projects that the bank financed in 2012?<br />
There are two or three projects that we were involved in Sohar and the Duqm areas.
&#8207;Most companies prefer to take project finance from OAB. What are the reasons for this preference?   
</b><br />
<br />
First of all we strongly believe that the main role of the bank is to support the development of the economy and infrastructure. Keeping this in mind we contact all the parties that are involved in projects. We are very fast in decision making and offer most of the facilities that contractors require. There are times when we put a branch of the bank in the camp of the project and we have done this in Sohar and Duqm.

<br />
<br />
<b>OAB has been working on strengthening its retail lending in the last few years. How has the progress been in this area?<br />
</b><br />
<b>We have increased our retail portfolio, but our policy is to limit retail lending and to make it reasonable to avoid social problems like debt burden etc.
</b><br />
<br />
<b>Why do you feel that consumer lending would create social problems like indebtedness?
</b><br />
<br />
If a customer borrows for the long term, say 30 years, and if the loan is not repaid while he is working, then after he retires he will end up getting only half his salary. Moreover, if he still cannot pay back his loan then the bank is forced to reschedule the loan according to his paying capacity. Thus a person is forced into a debt trap and this creates problems between the bank and people. Therefore there should be restrictions on the amount that can be borrowed and the period of a loan. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Central Bank of Oman (CBO) strikes a balance between retail lending and project finance. Does this help in addressing the issue?    
</b><br />
<br />
We adhere to the CBO norms of striking a balance between retail and project finance as one has to increase one’s personal loans to increase corporate lending and there is a link between the two. 
<br />
<br />
<b>&#8207;The CBO has permitted Islamic banking. Is OAB prepared with its Islamic finance offerings and what kind of opportunities does this open up? 
</b><br />
<br />
We are launching our Islamic brand Al Yusr, and we will start operations by June this year. Regarding Islamic finance we feel that there are certain difficulties that both the banks and customers are going to encounter in the beginning. This is because people are not familiar with the culture of Islamic banking, especially to those who are going to take money from Islamic banks. Customers will compare the cost of Islamic finance with the cost of conventional banking and if they find that the cost of Islamic finance is more than conventional banks then the question is whether they will stay with Islamic finance or leave. 

<br />
<br />
<b>Is there a cost difference between Islamic finance and conventional banking and is Islamic finance more expensive for customers?
</b>

<br />
<br />
I think it is more expensive, moreover the procedures are longer than conventional banking as the process requires complying with a number of rules and regulations. 
<br />
<br />
<b>OAB has been following a policy of increasing its ATM and branch network every year. Did your network grow in 2012 too?
</b><br />
<br />
We have been increasing our ATM and branch network every year. There are times when we enter into an arrangement with an on-going project and put up an ATM machine on site for their use. We have also found that our smart cards are the most secure form of payment for government related payments as no one can forge it or use it for a purpose that it is not intended for. Since 2000 till date we have never had a single mistake regarding these smart cards and we collect billions of rials through this system. The money through our smart card gets debited to the government account immediately while through the other cards it takes three days as their payments are routed from outside.

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">	<font size="1" face="Verdana">
<b>&#8207;Can you share your views on OAB’s HR policies and Omanisation?
</b><br />
<br />
Our Omanisation level stands at 93 per cent and this is higher than the mandated limit, and at the management level it is around 80 per cent. Not only do we recruit Omanis but we also train them. In 2012 we gave 226 courses training 1,941 participants and most of them were Omanis. Earlier, the head of departments at OAB came from Jordan because of our roots in Arab Bank. But I have gradually Omanised these positions. I recruit and train Omanis and put them next to an expatriate head for six months. After six  months, I send the expatriate on a vacation and give the Omani the responsibility of running the department. I would tell him, “If you succeed you will stay, if not you will go.” I used this process to Omanise most of our departments. Then I started to train Omanis to be branch managers and now 99 per cent of our branches are headed by Omanis. That’s the way we reached an Omanisation ratio of over 90 per cent. 

<br />
<br />
&#8207;<b>Looking at 2013 are you confident about Oman’s economy and OAB’s business prospects?</b>        
<br />
<br />
We are planning to shift our head office to our new office in Ghala and I believe that we will reorganise ourselves. We have an ability to increase our staff strength and business. The economy in general is poised to grow as the government is financially comfortable and they have the capability to spend on projects. This will help everyone to grow. 

<br />
<br />
<b>&#8207;Do you think that Oman is overbanked and the ensuing undercutting will harm everyone?
</b><br />
<br />
Oman is overbanked and too much competition definitely harms all banks, it also leads to banks, at times, giving money without following the fundamentals. Certain banks want to increase their portfolio and they lend money without following proper security norms and this is dangerous. I believe in competition, but it should be a trigger for improving service and not to reduce the security, because if a bank reduces security standards it will suffer in the end. We will discuss these matters with the Banking Association once it is registered.

<b>How has the Bank’s performance been in financial year 2012?
</b><br />
<br />
The year 2012 was a great year for BankDhofar. We embarked upon a new five year strategy with the aim of becoming the best bank in the Gulf - our BiG (Best in Gulf) plan. We have built on our natural strength of delivering outstanding customer service through the best staff in the business by improving everything else we do and really putting the customer at the heart of BankDhofar. All of our people are working hard to make us the best in the business and I am so proud of them. Our Omanisation record is excellent and we have successfully launched our training academy inviting specialists from around the globe to develop our people. We have also launched a Women’s Development Programme, in line with His Majesty’s vision. There is so much potential at BankDhofar.

<br />
<br />
<b>What are the measures that you have taken to strengthen your retail lending and corporate finance/project lending in the year gone by?
</b><br />
<br />
Where do I start ?! We have opened new branches throughout the Sultanate, perhaps most notably through our six new commercial and business centres to develop SMEs spread throughout the country and our new presences in a number of the shopping malls with branches (stores) which truly are at the leading edge of banking e.g. at The Grand Mall in Muscat and very shortly in Salalah too. We have even set up a worksite service team which will come to businesses and government departments and open accounts for employees on very special terms. If the customer cannot come to us we will go to them.
<br />
<br />
For our retail customers we launched the exciting new commitment of housing loans within five days as well as a market leading new prize draw savings account and double your salary initiative. We have also made sure that we get the basics right e.g. our ATMs are best in class registering over 99 per cent availability, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and our call centre is  best in the market.
<br />
<br />
For businesses we are determined to turn around lending requests in seven days and we have approved many cases much faster. We have also launched a market leading POS card swipe system which has proved to be extremely popular with our retail customers and opened a corporate call centre.
<br />
<br />
We continue to demolish unnecessary bureaucracy and make it easy for customers to deal with us - no big bundles of paperwork and multiple signatures at BankDhofar !
<br />
<center><img border="0" src="images/cover_chart_10.jpg" width="500" height="296"><br /></center>
<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<b>Can you share details about your branch and ATM network and are there any plans of upgrading your presence in the year ahead?
</b><br />
<br />
We have 62 branches and two Kiosks which I would rather call ‘stores’ as they are there to serve our customers and are powered by 126 ATMs and 43 CDMs currently. We are reaching out to all communities across the Sultanate. In order to serve the customers better multi-function machines were added, new services such as foreign currency withdrawals for BankDhofar and non BankDhofar customers at selected ATMs and requests for cheque books through BankDhofar ATMs are also being provided. 
<br />
<br />
We invest continuously in upgrading the quality of our branch designs and have some very nice surprises in store for our customers in the months ahead.
<br />
<br />
<b>Has the bank invested in its IT platform and what kind of efficiencies has this brought about to your operations?<br />
</b><br />
As part of our five year plan we have a multi-million investment in our IT platform providing our customers quicker turnaround time and more efficient transaction handling etc. BankDhofar is one of the banks in the region that has invested in a state-of-the-art core banking platform which is vital as we have such a young and dynamic population in the Sultanate who expect the latest technology. Mobile and internet banking solutions are a big priority.
<br />
<br />
<b>What are the measures taken by the bank to improve its HR practices?
</b><br />
<br />
Our motto is “united we succeed, divided we fail”! Without our great teams the company is worth nothing. We have speeded up our recruitment processes, brought in some outstanding new people to improve even further the abilities at the bank - mainly Omani but with just a little overseas help. We launched the new BankDhofar Academy which is geared towards creating our leaders of the future.We have completely re-written all of our policies and procedures and are breeding a tremendous cadre of outstanding staff.
<br />
<br />
<b>Can you tell us about your plans in FY2013?
</b><br />
<br />
We see 2013 with huge enthusiasm and action. Many of our projects designed to deliver outstanding service and products will be delivered this year making us absolutely the most innovative and customer focused bank in the market. Our aim is simply to be the best in the gulf and we are so grateful for the support we have received from our board and our people as well as enjoying the outstanding business environment afforded to us in Oman.&#8194;

<b>How was National Bank of Oman (NBO)’s performance in the financial year 2012?</b>
<br />
<br />
We have reported a strong growth during the financial year 2012.  The net profit after tax increased by 19 per cent to RO40.7mn compared to RO34.2mn in 2011. The operating profit of the bank grew from RO48.8mn in 2011 to RO52mn for the year ended December 2012. The operating income increased to RO98.6mn from RO92.2mn in the previous year, an increase of 6.9 per cent, mainly due to an increase in the net interest income arising from higher loan disbursals and lower cost of funds. An increase of RO180mn in the bank’s low cost deposits during the year 2012 led to an overall decrease in the cost of funds from 2.13 per cent at close of 2011 to 1.98 per cent at close of 2012. Net spreads stood at 3.09 per cent as at December 2012.

<br />
<br />
Operating expenses were RO46.7mn and have increased by RO3.2mn or  7 per cent over the previous year. The increase can be mainly attributed to higher staff costs and marketing expenses. Net cost of credit at RO5.3mn at the end of December 2012 is 48 per cent lower than the previous year, predominantly due to a reduction in the credit loss expense and impairment of investments.

<br />
<br />
The overseas operations continued to contribute to the overall net profit of the bank with an addition of RO0.9mn for the current year.  The bank is in the process of implementing the exit strategy of its operations in Egypt; two branches were closed during the course of 2012. The bank grew its net advances by RO241mn to RO1.9bn at the end of December 2012, an increase of 14.4 per cent over 2011. Customer deposits increased by 17.9 per cent and stood at RO1.9bn as at close of December 2012 as compared to RO1.6bn in 2011.
<br />
<br />
<b>What measures did NBO take to strengthen its retail lending and corporate finance/project lending in the year gone by?
</b><br />
<br />
The bank’s retail performance in 2012 was excellent. A number of innovative products were introduced and service quality across all delivery channels was improved. In line with the Sultanate’s plan of providing a home for every Omani national, the retail banking division assisted many nationals achieve this with the Al Manzel Housing Loan product. This portfolio has more than doubled from the previous year with customers seeing the value of buying a home as the more prudent approach when deciding to incur long-term debt.
With impending regulations, increased competition and a falling interest rate environment, the retail banking division pre-empted these challenging conditions and set in motion a very measured and thorough set of initiatives to insulate its retail lending portfolio from the adverse effects of the market conditions. 

<br />
<br />
On the corporate and project finance side, the year 2013 will continue to see the government announcing large projects in infrastructure and oil & gas sectors of the economy. The year will also witness large project initiatives by the private sector in focus sectors of the economy particularly tourism. The initiatives by the government will require the stakeholders to work on maximising in-country value in these projects as well as employment generation for Omanis in addition to the economic value for the country as a whole. In order to achieve the desired objectives for the bank, some of initiatives are as follows:

<br />
1- Setting up a dedicated project finance advisory team within the wholesale banking group to bid aggressively for large advisory assignments and cementing the relationships further with the alliance banks in the region to offer international quality advisory services. These services include strategic tie-ups with international players in the field to bid jointly for mandates from large project sponsors to offer advisory services to projects, which require advice on corporate structure as well as funding strategies through export credit agencies and financial institutions. These tie-ups also require the international banks to train young Omanis in these assignments
<br />
2- The bank has also been working closely with large players in the oil & gas and tourism sectors to provide a number of funded and debt advisory services to them.
<br />
3- The bank has also closely associated itself with Duqm as the emerging industrial and port town, by making available a large financing package for the development of Duqm Frontier Town, which is billed as one of the top 100 projects in the Middle East. The bank is seriously looking at other large projects slated to be launched in Duqm in 2013.
<br />
4- The wholesale banking group has also worked towards closer synergies between the divisions where businesses of corporate banking, investment banking, government banking, treasury and transaction banking complement each other offering a 360 degree offering to the client.

<b>Can you share details about your branch and ATM network and are there any plans of upgrading your presence in the year ahead?</b>
<br />
<br />
We have our presence across the country via 66 branches, 162  ATMs and 15 Cash Deposit Machines. We are currently employing a rigorous rationalising exercise to enhance our current network capabilities as this remains the edifice on which a successful retail bank can run.  We are planning to increase our ATM network along with cash acceptance machines by installing additional 16 ‘full function’ machines. These new machines will accept, as well as dispense cash, and will be placed in key branches/ strategic locations, benefiting many customers who would like to deposit their cash post banking hours.
<br />
<br />
<b>Has the bank invested in its IT platform and what kind of efficiencies has this brought about to your operations?
</b>
<br />
<br />
NBO views IT as a key enabler to the bank’s business strategy. In line with this view, the bank continues to make major investments in the development of differentiating products and services, to continuously enhance quality of our customers’ experience across all touch points and in the improvement of our operational effectiveness.
<br />
<br />
<b>What are the measures taken by the bank to improve its HR practices? 
</b><br />
<br />
In keeping with the bank’s corporate strategic objectives to recognise the importance of staff, the road map for undertaking human resources strategic transformation was conceptualised in 2011. The entire process began with an initiative to build faith in HR and to ensure seamless communication. The bank in its earnest efforts and constant journey of evolution in HR aligns itself to best practices by benchmarking against industry leaders. Our participation in various surveys, conferences and knowledge sharing forums with regards to various aspects of human capital gives us the required market data to align our attraction, acquisition and retention strategy. Initiatives launched this year like talent management, staff engagement programmes, HR Connect (a bi-monthly newsletter) give weight to NBO’s proposition in the market and also its commitment to the Sultanate of Oman to employ and develop Omani talent.
<br />
<br />
<b>Can you tell us about your plans in FY2013? 
</b><br />
<br />
Our aim is to outperform the market by capturing high potential market opportunities, through efficient processes and by ensuring that we have customer-focused employees.
<br />
<br />
Key initiatives include:
<br />
<li><font size="1" face="Verdana">Diversification of revenue streams</li>

<b>&#8207;How has the bank’s performance been in financial year 2012?
</b><br />
<br />
The year 2012 was an eventful year for HSBC in Oman as it witnessed the merger of HSBC Middle East Ltd.’s operations in the Sultanate with Oman International Bank to form a much larger, robust banking institution- HSBC Bank Oman. Even though the bank’s recently published financial results show a decrease in net profit, they reaffirm that our priority has been on the integration of the two entities. Integration expenses amounted to RO13.9mn which has contributed to a rise in total operating expenses to RO48.7mn for the year. The bank has recorded a 60.2 per cent increase in operating income and an 81.5 per cent increase in net interest income and we are now focused on achieving the growth opportunities present as a result of the combined entity. In the last two quarters of 2012, we were able to integrate two complex organisations. As a result, our board of directors are satisfied that we now have the organisational infrastructure and banking system in place to support our strategy for growth in 2013. When comparing 2012’s financial performance against that of 2011, we must remember that we are comparing operating costs of HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd.’s operations in Oman which had only five branches, against those of HSBC Bank Oman. We are now appropriately capitalised and have the proper infrastructure and banking systems in place to deliver sustainable returns on investments in years to come. 
<br />
<br />
<b>&#8207;The bank went through a merger with OIB. Has that process been completed?
</b><br />
<br />
 A critical part of any merger is the unification of data between two institutions which was completed in November 2012. This entailed brining more than 400,000 retail customers and 10,000 corporate clients under one banking platform. It also encompassed unifying internal banking systems of the entire branch network and streamlining working practices through staff training and development. In January 2013, rebranding of the entire HSBC Bank Oman network was completed to offer customers a consistent experience in terms of look, feel and service level in whichever branch they visit. 
<br />
<br />
Customers immediately felt the benefit of the systems integrations as it brought them services such as internet banking, PIN on IVR, SMS updates, dedicated contact centre support, and many other services that were previously unavailable to OIB customers including the ability to bank at any HSBC Bank Oman branch and not only their account holding branch. 
<br />
<br />
<b>What are the measures that you have taken to strengthen your retail lending and corporate finance/project lending in the year gone by?
</b><br />
<br />
HSBC Bank Oman continuously strives to adapt to market dynamics and meet customers’ changing lifestyles through improving existing propositions and introducing new products and services. We have made a number of lending policy changes to the benefit of our customers including, eliminating the need for OIB customers to provide a guarantor when applying for a personal loan. In addition, we have also introduced complimentary life insurance on personal loans. This has made HSBC Bank Oman’s retail banking loan proposition very competitive in the Omani market.
<br />
<br />
Our trade finance and international business continue to be at the forefront of our commercial banking proposition and our objective is to lead the way for Omani businesses, small and large, to trade with regional and global partners through international connectivity. HSBC Bank Oman also took a step to further strengthen its trade finance proposition through launching receivables finance which was successful and appealed to our clients as it opened up an attractive structured alternative to working capital needs. We have also invested in our on-the-ground payments and cash management proposition to strengthen our client’s coverage capabilities and commenced an aggressive rollout of tried and tested HSBC payments and cash management solutions in Oman.
<br />
<br />
<b>Can you share details about your branch and ATM network, and is there any plan for upgrading your presence in the year ahead?
</b><br />
<br />
HSBC Bank Oman operates more than 130 ATMs including more than 80 multifunction machines in high footfall locations across the Sultanate with a branch network of more than 80. Today, we are the second largest bank in Oman in terms of branch network and are constantly assessing our footprint to ensure we meet our customers’ needs. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Has the bank invested in its IT platform and what kind of efficiencies has this brought about to your operations?
</b><br />
<br />
In 2012, we made substantial investments in upgrading the bank’s infrastructure to build a robust platform on which customers could transact, HSBC Bank Oman’s business can grow and for our growing staff to work more efficiently and effectively. The investments in information technology included an upgrade of the entire communications network with connectivity between branches, offices, ATMs and our data centres. In addition, all former OIB branches received new computer equipment that meets HSBC’s global standards. We have also connected our entire ATM network to OmanNet National Switch Network, which has enabled customers to use any ATM across Oman, a privilege previously unavailable to former OIB customers. 
<br />
<br />
<b>&#8207;What are the measures taken by the bank to improve its HR practices?
</b><br />
<br />
We have made significant progress to integrate HR policies and procedures following the merger. We updated our employment proposition including the way individual performance is managed, how we pay all our staff as well as the level of benefits each employee can receive. We have also conducted a thorough review of salaries based on market analysis and job scope as we transitioned all HSBC Bank Oman employees to the HSBC Global Career Band structure. This resulted in the alignment of allowances, salaries and bonus levels, providing a solid foundation for future reward policy management and pay decisions based on the HSBC group reward strategy and group values.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, we have also introduced several changes to employee benefits that are based on the philosophy of ensuring they are equal across the bank, irrespective of individual global career band. This included adjustments to staff loan benefits, alignment of club memberships and service awards, an extension of medical insurance coverage to all HSBC Bank Oman employees, adoption and paternity leave to former OIB employees, alignment of maternity leave with annual leave policy, as well as equal opportunity for business education and career development.
<br />
<br />
In terms of training and development, we have deployed a team of dedicated professionals to deliver training on HSBC’s retail banking systems. We have also conducted mandatory HSBC training on risk, compliance, money laundering, information security risk and fraud. Over 4,300 delegate days of training were given over 312 sessions in the second half of 2012 alone. &#8207;Learning and development in 2013 will be focused on HSBC’s strategy, products and systems. Programmes targeted for delivery include the introduction of the HSBC Performance Management system to all employees and a bespoke syllabus for customer service representatives and branch managers.&#8194;

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">We have considered the growth and sustainability parameters for annual ranking of the commercial banks in Oman. The banks’ ranking model was done among the leading local banks which include Bank Muscat, National Bank of Oman, Oman Arab Bank, Bank Dhofar, HSBC Bank Oman (erstwhile Oman International Bank), Ahli Bank and Bank Sohar.
<br />
<br />
We have taken data for the period from 2009 to 2012 to rank the banks on the set parameters for growth and sustainability. For 2012, in the case of HSBC Bank Oman, we have incorporated the data of the merged entity. As a continuing process, the historical data in our ranking pertains to former Oman International Bank. During 2011, the newly established Bank Sohar became part of our ranking post completion of four years of operations along with the availability of data required. While in 2010, Ahli Bank became part of our ranking.
<br />
<br />
The data were sourced from the published financial statements (audited) of the banks, CBO reports and other published reports. Ranking based on the growth is done by calculating the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of gross loans, customer deposits, fee income, operating profit, networth and net profit over 2009 to 2012. In our ranking model, the operating profit is calculated by subtracting total operating income with the total expenses (excluding depreciation costs). Ranking based on the sustainability factor was done by calculating the four year average of three key factors which includes asset quality, productivity and efficiency. 
<br />
<br />
Asset Quality was ranked based on Non Performing Assets to the Gross Loans (NPA/GL) ratio and the overall loan provisions to non performing assets (Provision Coverage ratio). The productivity is ranked based on the operating profit of the bank to its total number of branches and number of employees. In conclusion, the efficiency factor considers net interest margins (net Interest income/average interest bearing assets), cost to income ratio, return on average assets (RoAA) and return on average equity (RoAE). For the calculation of cost to income ratio, we have excluded the depreciation expenses.

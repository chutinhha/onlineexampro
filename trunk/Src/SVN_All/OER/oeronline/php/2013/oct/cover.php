That an organisation conceived and developed by her and handful of her team members 11 years ago has today become a synonym for charity in Oman speaks volumes about the passion and dynamism of Mariam to work for the underprivileged section of the society. Dar al Atta'a which had a humble beginning in 2002 is now one of the largest charitable organsations in the region. In September, 2013, Mariam led a team from Dar al Atta'a to receive the Shaikh Issa bin Ali bin Khalifa al Khalifa voluntary work awards in Bahrain. The award was instituted to honour prominent figures in volunteering work representing 17 Arab countries and the United Nations Volunteer Programme. She shares the credit with her colleagues stating that each board member has a specific responsibility and they work hard to fulfil their duties. Mariam says Dar al Atta'a tries to be the link between the giver and the recipient. "As Islam stresses on sharing a number of people were doing charity, but most of them were repeatedly giving to the same set of people. We have helped them to reach out to a larger group."

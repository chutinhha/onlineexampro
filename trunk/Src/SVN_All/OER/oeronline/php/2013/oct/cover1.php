<strong>Nada Maqbool Sulaiman
<br/>Director, Salman Corporation<br/></strong>
 
 <br/>
 <p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
Nada opted for a massive career change when she moved from the banking sector to her family-owned business. After completing her Master's in Financial Services from Glasgow, UK, she came back to Oman and joined the National Bank of Oman (NBO) where she worked as a ?nancial analyst before she decided to make the 'big' move. It's been four years since Nada joined Salmanstores where she has attempted to bring in several innovations such as Salmanstores Advantage Card and new advertisement concepts.
<br />
<br />
The shift from ?nance to a marketing position in her family business has changed both life and career dimensions for Nada. "I wanted a change. It was not that I was unhappy in my previous job but I thought the place to be was in the family business and hence I made the decision to jump into a totally different line," she explains. She also adds that being part of the family business also means that people expect more in terms of what you can do and how well you can do it.

<strong>Radha Mukherji
<br/>CEO, ADINC DDB<br/></strong>
 
 <br/>
 <p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
Radha has a BSc (Hons) in statistics and an MBA from Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta. With a strong quantitative background, advertising wasn't even remotely on her radar as a career option. So, in her first few working years she flitted between roles in MIS, marketing, market research, and product management until chancing upon advertising 30 years ago. She loved it instantly and just stayed on. She found the atmosphere of ad agencies a welcome change from the starchy, hierarchical set-up of the large organisations that she had worked in until then. Radha thinks that advertising sensitises one to look beyond the obvious, to recognise non-verbal cues, interpret behaviour, modify attitudes and in the process understand oneself better as well. In a profession where coming up with new ideas at each meeting and brainstorming is a basic requirement, there is not a dull day. Radha feels that gender is a non-issue when one gives not just one's heart but the very soul to the profession.

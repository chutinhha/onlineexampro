The decision, taken at a board meeting at the beginning of September, takes the total capital for the integrated tourism complex to RO50mn.

The report examines and compares the global competitiveness of 148 economies based on efficiency enhancers, innovation and sophistication factors as well as the basic requirements of doing business, which includes infrastructure, health and education and economic environment. Commenting on the report, HE Dr. Salem bin Nasser Al Ismaily, chairman of the Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development (PAIPED), said, "Oman has taken great strides forward in becoming an attractive business destination and partner. The Sultanate still ranks fourth in the MENA region for competitiveness but by making advances in every pillar of the Global Competitiveness Index we are realising an ambitious plan to diversify the economy, attract foreign investment and enhance the framework necessary to become an international business hub."

The 2012 telecoms retail price benchmarking report for Arab countries published in March 2013 shows that high usage residential and business broadband packages in Oman are provided for the lowest cost in the region, while mobile broadband in the Sultanate is the second cheapest out of the 22 countries surveyed. The study also shows that broadband in Oman in the 2 Mb/s to 8 Mb/s speed range is ranked most competitive in the region for both business and residential customers. The high rating shows that there has been a huge drop in tariffs, as well as nearly twice as many service options since the last report in 2010. The recent launch of 4G services in the Sultanate has further enhanced broadband competiveness and taken communications in the country to the next level. This jump in technology took place after the report had been researched; and Oman is likely to score even higher in the 2013 results.</span></td>

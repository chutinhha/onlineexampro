<strong>Hurdles galore
</strong><br />
<br />
One of the bigger challenges facing private healthcare operators is the non-availability of qualified professionals such as doctors and paramedical staff. "Although the increase of population creates a lot of opportunities for the sector, getting qualified and competent professionals has always been a big challenge," says Biju. "In India where we get majority of our staff from, people are very well paid.The people are not very keen to leave the country and come here until and unless you give them something really attractive."
<br />
<br />

Pillai corroborates this view saying one of the major challenges of health care sector in Oman and around the world today is attraction, retention and development of quali?ed healthcare professionals. Jayan substantiates it further stating, "Noted healthcare professionals are in huge demand everywhere in the world. A talented and successful medical specialist now earns in India or the country of his or her origin more than what we can offer here. If you want to have quality people here you need to pay more and it directly affects your cost of operation." He feels that in Oman, compared to other countries in the GCC region, revenues are not commensurate with the operational cost. "The revenue is not as high as the operational cost in Oman due to various factors such as lower insurance premium as compared to other GCC countries. The proposed mandatory insurance for all can further improve the situation and magically change the healthcare industry." 
<br />
<br />
DrAkoum calls for a comprehensive upgradation of the medical education in the country in order to produce more talented professionals to meet the increasing demand not only in the public sector but in the private sector also. "Private sector has an acute shortage of quality health professionals. As long as the country depends on foreign professionals to meet its demand, the mismatch between the demand and supply will continue."
<br />
<br />
DrHarikrishnan highlights the necessity of making it easier for the expertise to be brought in from other countries, especially India. According to him, a uniform policy on health insurance would be greatly helpful. "I feel everybody should have health insurance so that people can avoid waiting for the government sector alone. A lot of expatriates who do not have access to health insurance cannot afford treatment in the private sector. Therefore health insurance needs to be made compulsory for all and sundry and insurance companies need to be instructed by the government to make sure that they offer health insurance to everybody unconditionally. It is compulsory for the insurance companies in all European and many of the south Asian countries to accept anybody who walks in."
<br />
<br />

Many insurance companies consider obesity surgery as a cosmetic surgery, which DrHarikrishnan describes as being farthest from truth. "Obesity is the forerunner to so many diseases including the overall reduction in life expectancy. Insurance companies should realise that the cost of obesity surgery borne by them will actually save a lot of money for themselves, the patients and the healthcare sector in general, by preventing conditions like diabetes and arthritis requiring treatment for 20 to 30 years. The number of people reporting for such surgeries and medication will drastically reduce if they spend money upfront on obesity surgeries."
<br />
<br />
DrPanakkal says the overall healthcare cost in Oman is relatively high. People who are not covered by insurance expect more economical treatment. "One welcome change I have observed during the last few years has been the shift of many people from cash payment to insurance coverage. That really helps the private sector to thrive better," he says. "Earlier buying medicines and getting treatment and investigations were very costly for most of the people, so they waited to go home and brought most of the medicines from there. The cost of medicine in Oman is also higher compared to their home country, because medicines available here are mostly from branded and reputed companies. Once insurance came, this scenario changed. We also find some brands suddenly go out of stock. For instance, Lasix, a very essential medicine for the treatment of heart failure, went out of stock a few months ago panicking many patients."
<br/>
<br/>
"Definitely healthcare is not that cheap in Oman," adds Biju. "If you want to do a knee surgery the implant itself costs you a thousand riyals. You need to pay the consultant a bigger amount. So you cannot do a surgery at a cheaper cost. But it is not much higher than going abroad."
<br/>
<br/>
Purchase and procurement is another challenge, as noted by Jayan. The hospitals need to make booking much in advance. Most of the suppliers are nodal points and do not deal directly with the manufacturers, thereby increasing cost and delaying delivery. Once there is a substantial increase in volumes, the manufacturers will set up direct outlets. However, the options are much better compared to earlier days. DrHarikrishnan also calls for making the import of equipment easier and less cumbersome. "We go through the process of getting approval from the Ministry for everything and it takes from weeks to months. If there could be a clear-cut policy and certain companies are pre-approved by the government on the basis of their performance, we can approach those companies and cut both time and cost. Ultimately reducing the cost for the private sector companies means that that much cost has been reduced to the patients because whatever cost is incurred by the private sector is passed onto the patients."

<strong>Easing procedures
</strong><br />
<br />
In order to ensure the quality of health services in the country, MoH closely monitors the private operations during the planning, construction and the actual running, in the form of technical protocol and the selection of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff. The ministry has made it mandatory for all health professionals from abroad to pass its examination to get recruited anywhere in the country. All the applicants have to travel to Oman to take the test. As per the current regulations, a doctor, say, can come only once in a month to write the exam and, if failed in that attempt, has to wait till the next month to clear the test.  Some private operators say the whole process kind of delays the recruitment process in the private hospital.
<br />
<br />
Biju thinks introducing online exam will be a good option so that the professionals need not come all the way to Oman only to write the exams. "In Dubai they do online exams which reduces the difficulty for the applicants. Here we lose a lot of good people because they find it very difficult to travel for the test and again for the interview. In addition, interviews should be more frequent rather than once in a month. However Oman is one of the better places to set up health care facilities. Here people are very humble and getting clearance is very easy. It normally takes only three weeks to get a visa for a doctor in Oman whereas in Qatar it will take three months. If you look at Saudi it takes nearly six months. Our group is established in different parts of the world and we find Oman to be one of the best places to operate from. Initially we had to wait for months for an inspection, but right now they have increased their efficiency."
<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Manpower's regulations are also creating a lot of operational problems for the private operators. "As per the Ministry of Manpower regulation we are forced to give a holiday on Friday and Saturday whereas a sector like ours cannot have a holiday," says Biju. "On Friday evening, you find the hospital almost empty without staff. Some of these rules make it difficult to function as a hospital which has to function round the clock. Rules like having two-day compulsory holidays will be very difficult for a service sector like ours which deals with life and death of people and therefore has to operate everyday." According to Jayan, although the Oman Labour Law has incorporated many changes considering the international standards and general wellbeing of employees across the industries, there should be scope for certain customisation when it comes to doctors and paramedical staff.

<br />
<br />
<strong>Going abroad
</strong><br />
<br />

Another major challenge is to enable the sector to meet up its various new problems thereby reducing the number of people pursuing advanced care abroad. As DrHarikrishnan explains lifestyle related problems are on the rise in Oman. Most important of these are diabetics, visual impairment and communicable disease. Obesity is an alarmingly growing problem. Sports injuries and traffic accidents cause a lot of orthopedic disabilities these days. "We are trying to discourage people from going abroad because we bring expertise to their door in bariatric surgery and orthopedics. We bring experts here for the surgery and our in-house doctors will look after the postoperative care." Jayan says the number of people flying outside the country for advanced treatment has come down considerably after they have realised that they can get the same treatment in Oman. "People are flying abroad either because they don't get the expertise they are seeking or they do not have the trust in the private sector. It is slowly changing now. We need successful organisations that are proving their mettle," he adds. 
<br />
<br />
DrPanakkalsays as the private sector is getting stronger with upgraded services and advanced facilities, they can change the perception of people. Equipped with more doctors, infrastructure and expertise, they can attract more people who are going abroad. However he admits that tertiary facilities such as open heart surgery organ transplantation programmes etc. require huge investment; but people who go abroad for such facilities constitute a small percentage of the total population. Citizens get most of such facilities from the MoH hospitals like Royal Hospital and Sultan Qaboos University Hospital free of cost and expatriates would like to do it in their home country; therefore such facilities are not easily sustainable in the private sector.
<br />
<br />

<p class="style15" style="line-height: 14px">
<br />
Saileswaran opines that every business opportunity has a life cycle and the same holds true for the medical tourism business. "At the early stage of this lifecycle you would see almost all acute care needs referred to aboard for treatment. However, as the healthcare infrastructure of the geography improves one will slowly see changes in this very mix which is already underway in Oman. Yet, some complex procedures would continue to be referred to select international centres of excellence."
<br />
<br />
According to Biju, some people club healthcare with their foreign trips. "And for some tertiary care facilities people opt for foreign facilities," she says. "A heart attack patient may prefer India for advanced cardiac treatment because we don't have the full setup here in the private sector. But there are still people who go abroad for, say, orthopedics or laparoscopic surgeries because of a lack of awareness. However their number is declining to a great extent. I can surely say that at least every month about 20 per cent of our patients who had planned to go abroad for surgery change the decision and get it done here. With more hospitals coming up, their number would decrease further.  
<br />
<br />
<strong>Lack of planning
</strong><br />
<br />
Many people who start operation in the private healthcare sector do not do a proper study or plan before starting hospitals, thereby causing a lot of troubles. Jayan feels that it is important to understand the dynamics of the industry before starting operations like any other venture. The health sector demands high-level technical expertise and critical management abilities considering the multifarious challenges varying from recruitment to medical protocols and clinical scrutiny. He opines that it brings a new opportunity for the likes of Starcare Health Systems who proved their expertise in turning loss making healthcare facilities into profit making units. "Now we are getting a lot of proposals from various polyclinics and other facilities in Oman to provide management expertise. We carefully study all the proposals and when we are confident we actually take them up."
<br />
<br />
"Setting up a hospital is a big challenge," adds Biju. "Right now we see some people who have no prior experience in the industry coming and venturing into a hospital or a clinic. I think this is not a good trend. When those people come to the field, they create a lot of problems in terms of quality. We should identify people who have good background and expertise in the field. It is good if you can actually look at the credibility of the people who come to start." She also avers that new operators have to take into account the geographical distribution of facilities. "Some people don't take into account the geographical importance of the location before opening a hospital. If you have too many facilities in a single location, then eventually everybody will suffer. In pharmacy, they have a very good rule that there should be a minimum distance of 300 metres between the outlets so they do not allow you to set up a pharmacy next to another. A similar thing must come up for hospitals too."
<br />
<br />
<strong>Sharing the burden
</strong><br />
<br />
As long as there is a discrepancy between the demand for health services and the provision of the government, the latter cannot ignore the private sector's contribution. It needs to be given more opportunities to expand in order to provide tertiary level services which will reduce the burden of government hospitals. DrHarikrishnan feels that although private sector is very well regulated by the Ministry in Oman, there has to be some room for it to flex its muscles and expand its services. "Overly regulating the entire private sector will prevent them from offering the services which are in demand and which the government sector is not in a position to address.

<br />
<br />
A lot of government-private sector interaction is going on these days. The government is very keen to have good partnership with the private sector for providing services together. As DrHarikrishnan explains, there is a huge waiting list for endoscopies and major surgeries, especially orthopedics, in the government sector. The government can partner private facilities capable of providing excellent services to take care of these treatments. "I think there are some talks going on but I don't know what level of understanding has been reached. What we can do is to have a tight leash on the quality of the doctors, nurses and paramedical staff we employ in order to give the highest standard of care. I recently attended a meeting organised by the Ministry of Health which addressed the important topic of professional development of doctors in the private sector. We recommended that we should have a panel of government and private institutional representatives who can decide on how government and the private sector can collaborate to help one another. For instance, at the moment the private sector depends on the government sector for certain acute emergencies and ICU facilities while the government can pass on some of its load in terms of common surgeries."  
<br />
<br />

Biju opines that the public sector is encouraging the private sector by sending patients to private facilities for gastroenterology and laparoscopic surgeries. She says discussion is going on with regards to referring a number of their patients to private hospitals. For example, form next month onwards, Sohar government hospital is sending some of their delivery cases to Al Raffah hospital in Sohar.
<br />
<br />
Jayan calls for a continuous dialogue and exchange of views between MoH officials and the private sector to ensure participation and progress. "Coordination committees and other government mechanisms should be utilised to establish a financially viable and practically effective healthcare model. For instance there is scope for improving the licensing procedure in the private sector and this would help to attract good talent from other countries," he adds. 
<br />
<br />
This all testifies to the fact that strategic partnership is the way ahead. Fostering healthy partnership and cooperation between public and private sector can go a long way and do wonders in addressing most of the healthcare problems facing the country today.

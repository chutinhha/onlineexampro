				<font face="Verdana" size="1">BankDhofar has introduced a new a point of sale (POS) device which utilises the most up-to-date technology currently on the market providing businesses in Oman with advanced functionality and capabilities. The unique POS machine will allow retailors to process payments through GPRS which does not telephone line. The payment process is secure, from credit cards and debit cards and smart chip cards. Taking advantage of the latest General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) wireless communication technology, the devices will have an extended coverage area and increased flexibility. They will incorporate a near field communication NFC infrared scanner which removes the need to swipe thus making the payments process for both the retailer and the customer much more efficient. The scanning system makes it easier to service customers in a quick yet effective manner and decreases the amount of time they have to spend waiting in line.

				The ninth edition of the Nawras Goodwill Journey, a 10-day and 5400- kilometre journey by Nawras Goodwill messengers to provide donations and gifts to over 4000 Omanis during the holy month of Ramadan, concluded in Dhofar governorate, by distributing sewing machines and household items to the Omani Women’s Associations in Al Mazyoona and Mirbat. This year’s journey adopted the slogan of ‘Multaqeen’, meaning ‘we will see you again’, to ensure that projects supported by Nawras are developed into long term programmes that benefit local communities for many years. During the second leg of the Nawras Goodwill Journey the team has travelled from Muscat to Salalah in five days, stopping in Ibra, Al Qabil, Wadi Bani Khalid and Al Duqm before reaching Al Mazyoona and Mirbat in Dhofar. The volunteers have provided air conditioners, washing machines, water coolers, sewing machines and kitchen utensils to assist with the services offered by the Omani Women’s Associations which improve the daily lives of people in these areas. Donations of vital supplies and equipment to charitable organisations will support long term education and skills training programmes run by the Ministry of Social Development for the benefit of those who need a helping hand.

				More than 70 Omani companies along with members of government entities attended the first trade-up best practice seminar and workshop organised by the Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development (PAIPED) to gain insights on how to cater for international buyers. The attendees gained in-depth knowledge from industry experts into the direct correlation between creative marketing and packaging and a product’s shelf life. <br />“PAIPED is focused on increasing the market share of Omani products in economies around the world,” said Nasima Yahya Al Balushi, PAIPED director general of export development. “Every year we participate in dozens of exhibitions and it is through these events that we have been able to assess how global companies successfully create their niche. Taking back these learnings, we have specially designed our latest series of trade-up seminars to help raise the profile of national products and increase non-oil exports.”

		Broadband and voice service costs in Oman are amongst the most competitive in the region, according to an independent report issued by AREGNET, the Arab world communications regulatory network. The 2012 telecoms retail price benchmarking report for Arab countries published in March 2013 shows that high usage residential and business broadband packages in Oman are provided for the lowest cost in the region, while mobile broadband in the Sultanate is the second cheapest out of the 22 countries surveyed. The study also shows that broadband in Oman in the 2 Mb/s to 8 Mb/s speed range is ranked most competitive in the region for both business and residential customers. The high rating shows that there has been a huge drop in tariffs, as well as nearly twice as many service options since the last report in 2010. The recent launch of 4G services in the Sultanate has further enhanced broadband competiveness and taken communications in the country to the next level. This jump in technology took place after the report had been researched; and Oman is likely to score even higher in the 2013 results.

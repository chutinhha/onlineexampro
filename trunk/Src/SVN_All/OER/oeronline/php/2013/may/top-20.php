<br />
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 14px; margin: 10px">

Despite intensified competition in the mobile and fixed markets especially in the domain of international telephony in 2012, Omantel has demonstrated that consistency and good performance in domestic retail revenues and growth in subscriber and revenue market are effective strategies that can help a company to retain its position as the number one company in the country
<br />
<br />
The implementation of the endorsed brand structure, using Omantel as the main brand and Omantel Mobile, Omantel Business and Omantel Wholesale as sub-brands has greatly contributed to a substantial increase in the company’s brand equity. By becoming the first telecommunications operator to commercially launch 4G LTE in the sultanate, Omantel has continued to focus on further improving the value proposition to its customers, having realised that broadband data in both consumer and corporate market are key growth areas.
<br />
<br />
Omantel continued to enhance its “Carrier of Carriers” business strategy as a key contributor to revenue growth while remaining focussed on creating sources of income and diversifying the investment portfolio to achieve sustainable growth in revenue and maximise shareholder returns. The growth in total revenues in the period from 2010 to 2012 has been mainly driven by the increase in mobile revenue resulting from an increase in the number of mobile (and in particular prepaid) subscribers and broadband revenue streams. Total revenue of Omantel group includes the operations of the Worldcall Telecom Limited, Pakistan.
<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
The total group revenue as of December 2012 rose by 1.4 per cent to RO458.9mn compared to the corresponding period of the previous year
Mobile broadband subscribers and related revenues recorded a growth of 60 per cent and 69 per cent respectively

<br />
<br />
Growth in mobile subscriber base reached 2.55 million, a net increase of 276,000 (excluding mobile resellers) while total network subscribers including mobile resellers reached 3.059 million, a growth of 8.5 per cent
Aggregate internet and data communications revenues witnessed a growth of 15.6 per cent over 2011

<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
In 2013, the company will build on its brand with an emphasis on providing enhanced customer experience as well as bringing innovative and affordable services to its customers. 
Several regulatory initiatives have been under consideration which are contributing to the way the sector operates. Some of these initiatives are aimed at increasing sector liberalisation such us providing additional license in various domains which may pose a threat to the existing operators, if the same are not properly conceived.

<br />
<br />
“The company’s strategy remains focused on customer experience, brand, growth, customer retention, market leadership, and cost efficiencies, with an aim to continue delivering shareholder value”

<br />
<b>Outlook</b>
<br />
<br />
The new ‘We Can Do More’ vision reflects the strategy of the bank for the coming period. The opportunities identified by the bank include major infrastructure development projects and government focus on economic diversification and tourism development. Every year over 50,000 Omanis are entering the workforce and the government has announced higher minimum wages for them which will lead to new banking opportunities.
<br />
<br />
The year 2013 will be a period of increasing competition for the banking sector with the launch of Islamic banking operations, competitive channels and new products to cater to the various new and growing sectors.

<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"> <br />
Shell Oman has implemented the business transformation programme which has moved the company into a world class, customer focussed organisation with simplified and standardised processes to conduct its business thus ushering in long-term benefits

<br />
<br />
Shell Oman Marketing Company’s business has grown significantly in 2012 compared to the previous year with 12 per cent growth in volumes led by the retail, aviation and local lubricants segments with significant headway in bitumen.
<br />
<br />
The growth in fuel volume is attributable to enhancement in the road infrastructure and industrial developments across the country increasing the opportunity to roll out new service stations.
<br />
<br />
Challenges remained in retaining and winning volume in the commercial segments due to increased competitive pressure. Export volumes of lubricants decreased due to lower demand across the Middle East and Central Asia.

<br />
<br />
For the year ended 2012, revenues crossed the RO400mn mark, ending 13 per cent higher than the same period the previous year. The net profit was RO12.29mn compared to RO12.6mn the previous year. The basic earnings per share (EPS) were two per cent lower than the same period a year ago as the increased revenues from higher volume growth were offset by the impact of price fluctuations affecting the valuation of aviation stocks held together with higher costs in the business.

<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
Seven new service stations were opened as compared to four in 2011 were opened last year
The company set a new record for the total number of 1,352 days with no Lost Time Injury (LTI) incidents in 2012

<br />
<br />
Four locations in the aviation segment won Goal Zero HSSE (health, safety, security and environment) Award for the year 2012
<br />
<br />
One independent Omani retailer won the Shell “Global Cluster Retailer of the World” in the Global Retail Smiling Stars Event in South Africa


<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
The retail business remains the leading segment for the company and key priority in the long term strategy. The government spending in infrastructure development and job creation across the country ensures that the retail sector will continue to grow in the years ahead with increased opportunities for capital investment.
<br />
<br />
For 2013, the company sees major investment projects planned by the government, which will attract more investment in the country. This will reflect in creating more business opportunities in different market segments.
<br />
<br />
“The company believes that talent development is one of the key success factors that would help the organisation achieve its aspirations. As part of our effort to meet the commitment, the HR team arranged and formulated a number of learning and development opportunities for our staff. We ensured that learning interventions address development needs for today and the future through the use of a blended learning approach across businesses”

<br />

Renaissance Services is working on creating opportunities for young people and generating local employment in every country where it has an established presence as a part of its commitment to In-Country Value 
<br />
<br />
Renaissance is creating value through the development of two world-class, internationally competitive businesses – Topaz – a global Offshore Support Vessel (OSV) shipping company and Renaissance Contract Services Group (CSG) – an international Integrated Facilities Management (IFM) company. This is being achieved by being a model public company and following the values of good governance, transparency, business ethics, financially sound and secure (strong balance sheet) and best practices (HR, Financial, Legal; Systems and processes). The company is also a model oil & gas professional services provider which is: safe (no harm to people); efficient (cost-effective, compliant, quality services); green (no harm to the environment) and local (serious about in-country value (ICV)).
<br />
<br />
This model is extremely attractive to International Oil Company (IOC) and National Oil Company (NOC) blue-chip clients. The company’s structures are kept lean and flat and turned facing its customers. It’s business model helps to drive down unit cost of oil or gas production for clients in terms of optimum balance of speed, quality and price.
<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones 
</b><br />
<br />
Topaz Marine’s expansion of operations into Saudi Arabia and Nigeria are amongst the positive developments of 2012; along with the deployment of new vessels Rayyan, Reliance and Dignity. Entry to Angola is planned for 2013.
<br />
<br />
Topaz has been issued a letter of intent for mobilising four vessels to Russia for Saipem to work on the Filanovsky pipeline installation project. This follows the October 2012 success of a $45mn seven-year contract for Oxy in Qatar.
<br />
<br />
CSG has a strategy to extend the successful PAC model to other sectors outside the oil & gas industry. The company has signed a Utilisation & Development agreement with the Authority of the Duqm Economic Zone; and is considering other similar initiatives for long-term growth.
<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
The global economy is expected to make a hesitant and uneven recovery over the coming two years. But the outlook for the oil & gas sector in Renaissance Services main markets is positive. The GCC is forecasted to award over $50bn worth of contracts in the oil, gas and petrochemical projects market in 2013, almost double 2012 (source: MEED Insight). This reverses the slowdown since the record $52bn worth of contracts awarded in 2009. In Azerbaijan, while oil production is slowing, Total S.A. has announced a major gas discovery in Absheron gas field offshore 100 km southeast of the capital Baku. The field is estimated to have around 300 billion cm of gas boosting Azerbaijan’s gas reserves from 2.2 to 2.5 tn cm. There is continued progress on Shah Deniz II (SD II), the country’s leading gas project. The company is looking at these future opportunities with optimism.

“Our in-country value ethos ensures we deliver an international world-class standard, with genuine local content that benefits the economies and communities in which we serve.

GCC has become a net exporter of cables due to the excess capacity that was installed on the assumption of continued growth witnessed during the period of 2006-2007. This has had a negative impact on price levels at a time when the demand is on a downward trend.

Renewed customer focus and state-of-the-art technology were the main highlights of 2012 for Nawras in which the company demonstrated its ability to capitalise on opportunities presented by the rapid transformation of communications
<br />
<br />
The Omani Qatari Telecommunications Company (Nawras) has maintained its unwavering commitment to investing in the best available technology for the benefit of its customers. This was the cornerstone of the company’s operational strategy and will continue into 2013 and beyond. Additionally, 2012 saw considerable focussed efforts on re-energising the customer experience. This involved significant investment in programmes aimed at improving the company’s understanding of its customer needs. This investment will continue through 2013 and will result in continued enhancements to the customer experience.
<br />
<br />
Another noteworthy initiative was the research conducted by Nawras to get detailed market intelligence. The outcome of this was a three-step programme: Researched, Analysed and Took Action. This has underpinned the revitalisation of the company’s business proposition, with the introduction of new products, services and tariffs. This has supported the adoption of a new business model that is much more attuned to evolving customer needs.
<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
Nawras has maintained a compound annual revenue growth of 45 per cent since the company started operations in 2005
The company has approximately 2.2 million customers, an increase of more than 11 per cent on 2011
Nawras was the only Middle Eastern telecoms company to be shortlisted in Ragan’s PR Daily Digital PR and Social Media Awards 2012 in the ‘Best Use of Facebook’ category
WiMAX is a technology that has proved successful with more than 40,000 customers, an increase of 63 per cent on 2011
Over 400 base stations were upgraded during the year, the latest phase in an ongoing logistical and financial commitment by the company.

<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
The challenge – and opportunity – for Nawras is to provide communications access to the majority of the population; to reduce operating costs while investing to maintain its market position; to retain existing customers; and to welcome new ones. The company’s opportunity – and challenge – is to harness the huge, untapped potential among customers currently not making use of data services with exciting and cost-effective offers. Partnerships with manufacturers and application providers will feature strongly in the next phase of the Nawras evolution. The company is already working side by side with Tata Communications to offer a comprehensive range of international services.
<br />
<br />
“It is a mark of a company’s maturity to be able to accept rapid change and adapt accordingly. We achieved this, meeting the many challenges of the year with the customary resolve, and focus on customers, that has become our trademark”

The bank recorded a strong performance during the year despite regulatory changes and ongoing global concerns while corporate social responsibility in its essence is how it manages the business processes to produce an overall positive impact on society

<br />
<br />
In December 2012, the Fitch rating agency assigned a long term issuer default rating of BBB+ with a stable outlook to National Bank of Oman (NBO). The report highlights the bank’s performance in 2012 and the strategic decisions that focus on business expansion and diversification. The report further highlights the fact that NBO has increased the retail lending despite recent Central Bank of Oman (CBO) regulations, and also increased its share of low-cost deposits.

<br />
<br />
The bank continues to work closely with its strategic alliance partner, Commercial Bank of Qatar, in many areas including cross-border business and the sharing of global best practices in terms of products, processes and systems. The bank also launched its Sharia compliant brand named ‘Muzn’, which offers a rich bouquet of products and services, catering to institutional, corporate and retail clientele.

<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
The bank achieved a net profit after tax of RO40.6mn in 2012 as compared to RO34.2mn the previous year, an increase of 19 per cent
An increase of RO180mn in the bank’s low cost deposits during 2012 has led to an overall decrease in the cost of funds from 2.13 per cent at close of 2011 to 1.98 per cent at close of 2012
The bank grew its net advances by RO241mn to RO1.9bn at the end of December 2012, an increase of 14.4 per cent over 2011
Customer deposits increased by 17.9 per cent and stood at RO1.9bn as at close of December 2012 compared with RO1.6bn in 2011
Corporate banking crossed an important milestone of RO1bn of corporate

In 2012, the bank’s community investment was RO200,000
The bank’s wealth management division offers the Reliance Portfolio Management service to all Non Resident Indians as well as Omanis

<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
Oman will remain the primary focus in the coming year, with the Bank capitalising on the UAE franchise as an additional service point for its Omani customers. The outlook for Oman’s economy in 2013 is positive with the increase in government spending and the focus on infrastructure projects is expected to boost economic growth. The launch of Islamic banking operations also opens up new opportunities for the bank in the coming years.

<br />
Despite increased competition from regional players as fallout of the slowdown in the regional economy and increased operational costs, OHI managed to post decent results thanks to the well-diversified portfolio of the group
<br />
<br />
The main contributors to Oman Holdings International Company (OHI’s) profits were the energy & infrastructure group and the technology group. The profit generation was also aided by the civil construction, marine and companies engaged in the services sector.
<br />
<br />
OHI is represented in the following sectors of the economy: energy & infrastructure group; information technology; telecommunications; construction; marine; services; real estate; hospitality; and retail electronics.
<br />
<br />
The staff costs during the year registered a significant increase of about 18 per cent thereby eroding the margins generated. The other operating expenses were generally in line with the levels of the previous year.
<br />
<br />
The share of results from associates during the year under review reflected a marginal increase over what was generated during the previous year. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
In 2012, the investment securities generated a gain of RO223,000 as against RO100,000 gain generated during the previous year
The net profit of RO6.1mn represents a satisfactory performance, when evaluated against the company’s share capital and total equity
The value of the company’s investment in securities grew by RO453K, through income statement and equity in 2012.
Within OHI group, the technology and energy and infrastructure group posted attractive results, albeit marginally lower than those generated during the previous year
The subsidiary engaged in civil construction generated a net profit in line with that generated during the previous year
The real estate sector saw some further improvement on the demand side, which helped the associate company operating in this sector

<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook</b>
<br />
<br />
Even as the economy in the Sultanate is being managed in a prudent and conservative manner, there are unavoidable linkages to the events taking place in the world economy. In Oman, the emphasis continues to be on infrastructure projects and job creation. It is expected that Islamic banking will commence in the country in right earnest, which should lead to further socio-economic development. The equity market has registered encouraging growth during the recent past, and it is hoped that this trend would continue. The real estate sector, which had been in a depressed state during the last two years, appears to be showing signs of increased demand, which is leading to better price realisation.
<br />
<br />
“We have been able to harness the synergies arising from our skills, local knowledge and prominent presence with the inherent competitiveness of our partners. Due to a focused approach and a strong marketing effort, despite market constraints, the growth has been sustained”

<br />
<br />
Despite the negative news about a second recession, which created a slowdown for the manufacturing sector, Al Jazeera Steel was able to achieve an annual growth of 13 per cent in profit as compared to 2011
<br />
<br />
Like in previous years, the steel industry has gone through its highly cyclical phases with intense competition in 2012. The first half of 2012 witnessed increasing steel prices on the back of strong demand, higher iron ore cost and improved activity in the construction sector.

<br />
<br />
In the second half of the year, the price was weak and demand was much lower due to drop in iron ore prices, surplus capacity, over supply in the market, and rapid liquidation of stock.
<br />
<br />
Therefore, Al Jazeera Steel Products Company cautiously managed its inventory levels due to the sensitivity and vulnerability of raw material pricing in light of the current global market scenario. This was effectively achieved through maintaining a well-calculated economical inventory levels as a means of avoiding speculative piling of HRC and billets. The management was also able to improve its supply chain, implement more sourcing diversification, and strengthen its customer relationships.
<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
The company moved up from average monthly sales of 22,000 MT in 2011 to over 24,600 MT in 2012 
Sales value increased from RO91.2mn in 2011 to RO98.3mn in 2012
The company was able to improve the capacity utilisation of Tube Mill division from 55 per cent in 2011 to 61 per cent in 2012
The Tube Mill division currently has a production capacity of 300,000 MT of pipes, which includes 80,000 MT of galvanised products per annum. The division produced and sold 182,058 MT in 2012 compared to 163,960 MT in 2012
Total capacity utilisation of Merchant Bar Mill (MBM) was 38 per cent in 2012, which is expected to increase to 47 per cent during 2013. The MBM division sold 113,492 MT of products

<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
The future demand for Al Jazeera Steel products is expected to be healthy in view of investment plans in infrastructure in the Middle East and North America. New demand is emerging for the company’s products from Iraq and Africa. Furthermore, the company is exploring more avenues to increase business in Saudi Arabia and Iraq and penetrate new markets such as Africa, Australia and Eastern Europe for its tubular, as well as MBM products.
<br />
<br />
“Al Jazeera Steel witnessed robust sales since inception.

In view of severe competition in the UAE, North of Oman and export markets, the company is working to optimise volume and price to derive the highest revenue and gains
<br />
<br />

The performance of Raysut Cement Company in 2012 has to be seen in the light of global uncertainties, regional as well as industry sector wise imbalances in the growth.

<br />
<br />
Along with a slide in global growth, the outlook of MENA countries remained mixed with varying growth rates.
<br />
<br />
The public expenditure and five year development plans of Oman did provide some opportunities in the construction segment. However, the hopes from it for the cement industry was largely overtaken by continued influx of cement from UAE suppliers at lower rates.
<br />
<br />
by continued influx of cement from UAE suppliers at lower rates.
The consolidated turnover for the group includes turnover from subsidiaries like Pioneer Cement, UAE; Raysea Navigation and Raybulk Corporation. Raysea and Raybulk, the two 100 per cent subsidiaries have provided valuable shipping and distribution services to the company and Pioneer, a 100 per cent subsidiary and integrated cement plant, has sold cement in UAE as well as in Oman.

<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
The parent company’s domestic sale of cement increased to 1.49mn tonnes, an increase of 5.3 per cent in volume
The sale in terms of revenues was RO40.24mn, an increase of 6.3 per cent over the previous year
Cement exports stood at 0.87 million tonnes, an increase of 33 per cent
Export revenues reached RO22.19mn
Overall cement volumes increase by 14.3 per cent to 2.35 million tonnes
Revenues from clinker stood at RO0.98mn

<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
The construction industry is in a revival mode in the region as a whole with new initiatives being undertaken in several countries including UAE. The increase in public expenditure in the Sultanate would provide a boost to the infrastructure sector during 2013. Therefore, it is expected that the cement industry would grow further through all these initiatives.
<br />
<br />

The construction sector in Oman is likely to grow at the rate of six per cent to reach a level of $5bn in the next few years from the current level of $4bn. With a number of construction projects on the cards, there would be higher demand for construction materials including cement in Oman.
<br />
<br />
The offloading of cement at lower prices by UAE suppliers is likely to continue for some more time, even though the current prices and demand in UAE is improving.
<br />
<br />
“While the demand for cement went up in Oman during the year due to several initiatives taken by the government, the inflow of cement from UAE suppliers at substantially lower prices had created a situation in the northern market in particular with a low to unsustainable level of return. However due to higher construction activities in southern and central Oman, the domestic segment as a whole experienced a moderate increase in prices and volume”

As an essential item of food, the overall market for vegetable oils and fats is stable, and is not dependent on macro-economic factors. Hence sale volumes growth over the years remains relatively stable and modest
<br />
<br />
Areej Vegetable Oils and Derivatives adapted itself to the significant changes in its operating environment in 2011 and the increase in manpower costs. Despite volatile international vegetable oil prices, the company managed the environmental factors and the price fluctuations in international vegetable oil market very well to earn a record net profit after tax of RO2.31mn. This works out to a 50 per cent return on the enhanced share capital after the 33.33 per cent stock dividend disbursed in 2009 and 50 per cent stock dividend disbursed in 2008. The company also recorded a sales turnover of RO92mn in 2012.
<br />
<br />
The company operates in an extremely competitive market environment as it caters to the needs of the individual and institutional customers in the region. There are ten other manufacturers in the GCC with duty free access to Oman. Further, the GCC is a net exporter of vegetable oils and fats. GCC products are generally available in all other markets in the region. The policy of free trade in the region creates intense competition and ensures that margins remain under pressure and consumer prices are kept down.
<br />

<b>Milestones
</b><br />

The company continued its programme of training Omanis at all levels including factory staff and management
Omanis for professional courses are also sponsored and the company currently has 59 per cent Omani staff covering all areas of sales, production, engineering, quality control, accounting and administration
Sale volumes have been stable in 2012, despite a drop in exports to Syria due to the unsettled conditions

<br />
<br />
<b>Outlook
</b><br />
<br />
The company expanded its production facilities in 2012. This expansion in capacity and the product range shall allow the company to improve its coverage of current and new market segments and market niches. However, the company operates in an industry characterised by high raw material content, so its products are also subject to price regulation in Oman and some export markets as an essential food item.

Through the Barka 2 and Al Rusail plants, the company dispatched a total net energy of 6,560 GWh and produced 42,686,522 m3 of potable water. 
The Barka 2 technical availability for the year was 92.6 per cent and 95.19 per cent for power and water respectively. At Rusail, the power availability during the year was 86.9 per cent. 
On September 2012, SMN Barka and Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) signed an agreement for the sale and purchase from the Barka 2 plant for a minimum quantity of 1,500 m3 of demineralised water required for the construction of Barka 3 project. During the last three months of 2012, around 10,240 m3 have been delivered resulting in a positive impact in the net earnings of the company.

<br />
<br />
The merger of Oman International Bank with HSBC Bank Middle East Limited’s Oman operations represents the banking sector’s largest merger to date in the Sultanate
<br />
<br />
The combination in June 2012 of Oman International Bank and HSBC Oman to form HSBC Bank Oman (HBON) has brought together two organisations with a rich history in the country. The result is a stronger and larger financial institution in the Sultanate, with a considerably expanded domestic network and a truly international presence. 
<br />
<br />
At the date of the merger, the combined entity became the third largest bank by total assets, and had the second largest branch network in the Sultanate. For both entities, the merger increased scale and international connectivity and for OIB customers, provides immediate access to HSBC’s global product suite.
<br />
<br />
The merger represented HSBC’s first merger in the Middle East and North Africa region for many years and provided the HSBC Group with a rare opportunity to increase scale and commitment to Oman. In the months following the merger, the overriding priority of the management team has been the operational, strategic and cultural integration of the two entities to ensure that customer expectations are met. 

<br />
<br />
Under challenging conditions, significant progress was achieved, thanks to the commitment, patience and support of loyal customers and the hard work and dedication of all of the employees.
<br />
<br />
<b>Milestones
</b><br />
<br />
Systems integration was completed in November, providing all HBON branches with access to an international standard banking and management system, supporting effective and consistent procedures across every branch 
HBON joined the OmanNet National Switch following the merger, providing the customers with immediate access to well over 1,000 ATMs across the Sultanate
The ATM network has also been updated extensively, with 107 units replaced and upgraded 
The management team has conducted a full review of the business, aimed at improving organisational efficiency and the sustainability of operating model 
As many as 21 branches have been refurbished, with 60 scheduled for completion in 2013

<br />
<br />
<b>Future outlook
</b><br />
<br />
HBON’s immediate strategy is dedicated to the completion of the integration and transition processes. This will drive the investment in the branches, people and systems, in order to support customers’ needs and deliver on strategic priorities. In 2013, the bank will shift its focus to the growth plan for the business, developing existing relationships, connecting its customers to more opportunities and delivering an increasingly consistent and superior customer experience.

<br />
<br />
Oman Refreshment Company performed well against tough market conditions such as the highly price-sensitive consumers, changing consumption habits and a highly competitive juice, water and snacks product segment

<br />
<br />
Oman Refreshment Company (ORC) is a leader in the Omani beverages market, holding the franchise rights to fill and distribute PepsiCo range of soft drinks and Aquafina water as well as trading in non-carbonated beverages and Frito Lays range of snacks throughout the Sultanate.

<br />
<br />

ORC has purpose-fit production and bottling plant as well as central warehousing facilities in Al Ghubra, Muscat and 10 depots situated al Al Wafi, Ibri, Nizwa, Saham, Salalah, Bukha, Buraimi, Musannah, Liwa and Mudhaibi that cater to the customers spread across the Sultanate.

<br />
<br />
The company invests significantly and regularly on the upkeep of current production lines, its distribution capabilities and marketing equipment with a focus on improving operational efficiencies as well as increased customer reach. Through its subsidiary, Al Rawdha Integrated Trade & Investment Enterprises, ORC is constantly exploring suitable new business growth opportunities.

<br />

</b><br />
<br />
ORC has aptly recognised the expanded warehousing needs and embarked on strategic expansion of warehousing capacity at various business locations to improve operational and marketing efficiencies.

</b><br />
<br />
ORC shall continue to invest suitably in business system and replacing aging assets. The company is optimistic about the future prospects with the product expansion and diversification plans and renewed impetus on achieving higher production efficiencies. However, the volatile prices of key input raw materials, packing materials, unstable job market and rising wage bill and stagnant consumer prices may impact profitability of the company in the near future.

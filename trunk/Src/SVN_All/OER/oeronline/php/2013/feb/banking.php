				<img border="0" src="images/banking01.jpg" width="154" height="103" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3">Hard on the heels of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) revising the 
				legal framework for the banking system in the Sultanate to 
				implement Islamic banking in the country, the last month has 
				seen the launch Oman’s first dedicated Islamic bank and the 
				hectic openings of Islamic windows by various conventional 
				banks. The newly introduced faith-based banking model is 
				believed to hold immense potential to take the banking industry 
				and the economy of the Sultanate to new heights.<br>
				<br>
				Bank Nizwa commenced its operation on January 10 at its 
				headquarters in Shatti al Qurum, and other two branches in Nizwa 
				and Sohar, heralding a new era of banking in Oman. The first 
				Islamic bank in the country has dedicated and highly skilled 
				staff as well as experienced industry experts at the managerial 
				level. Equipped with state-of-the-art banking systems and 
				software, the bank is capable of offering its customers the best 
				Islamic banking experience. The services offered by the bank 
				include account opening through identity cards for Omanis and 
				resident id cards for expatriates; instant issuance of 
				personalised ATM card, cheque book and much more.<br>
				<br>
				Since opening its doors, Bank Nizwa has welcomed a large number 
				of customers through its doors. “The launch of Bank Nizwa will 
				propel Islamic banking and the economy of Oman to a higher level 
				of development,” said Sayyid Amjad Mohammed Ahmed Al Busaidi, 
				chairman, Board of Directors, Bank Nizwa. “Throughout history 
				there have been defining moments which have brought about growth 
				and prosperity to our great country, Oman. It takes a lot of 
				foresight and courage to follow a dream and bring it to 
				fruition. For a long time we have aspired to fulfil the dream of 
				having a fully Sharia-compliant banking facility and we at Bank 
				Nizwa have worked tirelessly to make that dream a reality. I am 
				proud today to celebrate with you the successful opening of our 
				very own fully dedicated Islamic bank.”<br>
				<br>
				Dr Jamil El Jaroudi, CEO of the Bank said, “We take pride in the 
				fact that we are the first full-fledged Sharia-compliant bank in 
				the country with products such as current accounts, savings 
				accounts and personal finance as well as corporate business 
				services and treasury operations. Our goal is to create an 
				environment that serves as an inspiration for other Islamic 
				banks and Islamic windows at conventional banks to begin 
				operation in Oman so that the customers benefit from the best 
				practices.”<br>
				<br>
				Dr El Jaroudi added, “Through the consistent application of the 
				fair practices as laid down by the Sharia laws, we encourage 
				social fairness, profit sharing and ethical conduct. We believe 
				that these have been the pressing need of the people in Oman. 
				With our customer centric approach we wish to create new 
				benchmarks in the world of banking”.<br>
				<br>
				Speaking at the reception ceremony to commemorate the launch at 
				the bank’s head office, Dr El Jaroudi, commented: “At Bank Nizwa 
				we have an unwavering commitment to Islamic banking and we look 
				forward to assisting our customers with their financial needs. 
				The opening of our branches here at Qurum and also in Sohar and 
				Nizwa, is a significant step in the expansion of our financial 
				footprint and we will continue to invest in our growth, as we 
				further develop our presence across Oman. We will always act 
				upon the needs of our customers, delivering the Sharia-compliant 
				products and services that they require in order support their 
				current and future financial needs.”<br>
				<br>
				HH Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq al Said, Personal Advisor to His 
				Majesty, was the chief guest at the reception which was attended 
				by the founders, members of the board, executive management team 
				from the bank, media representatives and various dignitaries 
				from across the Sultanate.<br>
				<br>
				The assets of Bank Nizwa, which formally launched operations on 
				January 10, 2013, totalled over RO148mn as of end 2012. 
				Announcing the initial, unaudited financial results for the 
				quarter ended December 31, 2012, the bank also posted a net loss 
				of RO4.812mn for the period. Customer deposits amounted to 
				RO363K, shareholders’ equity was RO147.279mn. <br>
				<br>
				Operating income for the quarter was at RO8K, while the 
				operating expenditure was RO898K. In a disclosure notification 
				to the Capital Market Authority, the bank said it was announcing 
				its initial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 in 
				light of the fact that its ‘soft’ opening took place on December 
				23, 2012, during the period under review.<br>
				<br>
				However, Al Izz Islamic Bank, the Sultanate’s second Islamic 
				bank, which listed at Muscat Securities Market in early 
				December, is yet to commence operation. Earlier, the bank had 
				elected members of its board as Taimur bin As’ad Al Said as the 
				chairman.<br>

				Muzn is now officially open to welcome and serve customers at 
				its flagship branch in Al Sahwa Towers - Azaiba North, which is 
				a full-fledged Islamic banking branch. An impressive soft 
				opening was held at the Muzn branch under the auspices of Sheikh 
				Khalfan Al Esry, Muzn sharia supervisory board member, Sayyida 
				Rawan Al Said, NBO’s board member and Salaam Al Shaksy, NBO’s 
				chief executive officer, in the presence of the bank’s senior 
				management and staff. <br>
				<br>
				Muzn Islamic banking branch has qualified staff and robust 
				systems in place to offer a broad spectrum of Sharia-compliant 
				products and services, an NBO official said. Muzn’s range of 
				products will cater to institutional, corporate and retail 
				customers and include products like Murabaha Auto Finance; Ijara 
				Home Finance; Sale and Lease Back Finance; Muzn Current Account 
				(Qard Hassan); Muzn Savings Account (Mudaraba); Wakala 
				Investment; Flexi Wakala Account; Murabaha Working Capital 
				Finance; Ijara Muntahia Bittamleek Term Finance and Trade 
				Finance. <br>
				<br>
				The name Muzn is the Arabic word for clouds which are, in turn, 
				associated with favourable outcomes such as growth and 
				prosperity, fortune and plenty and blessings and longevity. In 
				turn, Muzn aims to deliver growth for money, hope and 
				prosperity.<br>

				Meethaq from Bank Muscat is all set to redefine Islamic banking 
				with the launch of operations at its dedicated branch in Al 
				Ghubra. HE Sheikh AbdulMalik bin Abdullah Al Khalili, Minister 
				of Justice, was the guest of honour at the grand ceremony. <br>
				<br>
				According to a release by the bank, “Bank Muscat is the first 
				commercial bank in Oman to receive CBO approval and begin 
				operations through independent Islamic banking window as per the 
				requirements of Islamic banking regulatory framework of CBO. 
				Ever since the announcement of the final CBO approval to begin 
				soft operations, customers have been pouring into Meethaq branch 
				to open accounts and avail various services.” <br>
				<br>
				Meethaq offers a full suite of regulated Islamic banking 
				products. The bank has invested in staff, systems and controls 
				to ensure the service is delivered in a professional, segregated 
				and fully compliant manner. Inspired by faith and a tradition of 
				trust, the Sharia-compliant products and services of the bank 
				include savings account, current account, home finance, auto 
				finance, and many other products.<br>
				<br>
				Meethaq plans to open branches in all major cities and towns 
				across Oman this year. Over a year ago, Bank Muscat announced 
				the decision of its board of directors to set up an independent 
				Islamic banking window with RO150mn capital and launch Islamic 
				banking operations in accordance with the injunctions of Sharia. 
				The final capital allocation will be determined by business 
				opportunities in the market and the board has indicated that the 
				assigned amount may increase if required.<br>
				Ahlibank has recently launched its Al Hilal Islamic Banking 
				services at its five branches (Samail, Bahla, Rustaq, Saham and 
				Muscat) simultaneously. The sixth branch is expected to open in 
				Salalah in February.<br>
				<br>
				Commenting on the launch, Hamdan bin Ali bin Nasser al Hinai, 
				chairman of Ahlibank said, “Islamic finance, by its very nature, 
				is a financial system that highlights the importance of aligning 
				the objectives of businesses with the needs of the community to 
				ensure that the overall well-being of society is not forgotten 
				when pursuing investment opportunities.” <br>
				<br>
				Abdul Aziz al Balushi, CEO Ahlibank said, “Our focus during the 
				first year will be to present the true identity and build a 
				bridge of trust and confidence with customers. This will 
				undoubtedly give us the required momentum and thrust to win the 
				customers’ confidence. Our services, products and dealing are 
				built on the tenants of truth and transparency and are in 
				accordance with Islamic Sharia principles to insure that we as 
				an organisation are committed to providing the best products 
				that the market has to offer’.</font></p>

				<b>Oman Arab Bank has also launched an independent Islamic 
				banking window under the brand name “Al Yusr”. The bank will 
				launch its Islamic operations with five branches across the

				operations are in compliance with Shariah (Islamic law). The OAB 
				Shariah board members are Dr Khalid Salim al Siyabi, Dr Ahmed 
				Subhi Ayyadi and Dr Essam Khalaf al Enezi.<br>
				<br>
				“We are confident that Al Yusr will provide customers with an 
				avenue to be true to their beliefs while offering all the 
				advantages of world class banking,” said Abdul Kader Askalan, 
				CEO of Oman Arab Bank. “Islamic banking seeks to promote the 
				ideals of a prosperous society and stable economy, based on 
				basic Islamic ideologies. Oman already has a flourishing banking 
				sector and the opening of the Islamic segment will only serve to 
				make it more diverse,” he added.<br>
				<br>
				BankDhofar is all set to announce the opening of its Maisarah 
				Islamic banking branch in Azaiba. According to a release from 
				the bank, the Maisarah has a team of highly skilled Islamic 
				banking specialists. Utilising the most advanced technology to 
				ensure Maisarah operates smoothly, they will offer a complete 
				suite of Sharia-compliant Islamic services that focus on Islamic 
				principles. The team has been busy undergoing extensive training 
				on the product portfolio, which includes savings accounts, car 
				loans and other facilities.<br>
				<br>
				CEO BankDhofar, Tony Mahoney said, “We’re really excited about 
				the opening of our first of many Maisarah branches and we’re on 
				track to see it open in the coming weeks. It’s a pretty 
				electrifying time for BankDhofar and banking in Oman.”<br>
				<br>
				Sohar Islamic, the newly introduced brand of Bank Sohar’s 
				soon-to-be-launched Islamic banking products and services, has 
				already unveiled its new logo. Bank Sohar signed an agreement 
				with Dar Al Sharia, the Dubai-based subsidiary of Dubai Islamic 
				Bank – the world’s first Islamic financial institution. The pact 
				tasked Dar Al Sharia with supporting Bank Sohar in its 
				aspirations to emerge as a frontrunner in the provision of 
				Islamic banking services in Oman. <br>
				<br>
				In addition, Bank Sohar signed up Path Solutions, a global 
				provider of software solutions to the Islamic financial services 
				industry, for the deployment of its pioneering iMAL Islamic 
				banking system.&#8194;<br>

					with key emphasis on infrastructure development and creation 
					of jobs to further stimulate the economy. On the expenditure 
					side, financial allocations for Government ministries and 
					development programmes have been raised by 30 per cent to 
					complete infrastructure projects underway like ports, 
					airports, roads, water, sewage network and projects at Al 
					Duqm Special Economic Zone.<br>
					<br>
					The expenditure also includes the allocation for training 
					16,000 new jobs. Last year the government created 36,000 
					jobs for Omanis by spending RO300mn. This year, 56,000 jobs 
					would be created, of which 20,000 will be in the government 
					sector.<br>
					<br>
					“The budget is very positive and well-balanced. And the 
					additional job opportunities among youth will boost spending 
					and thereby aid the growth in credit through an increased 
					demand for finance this year,” says Ajit Engineer, CEO, 
					Muscat Finance.<br>
					<br>
					“The budget focuses on attracting local and foreign 
					investment in the private sector, supporting growth of the 
					small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, and setting up new 
					industrial zones. The increased spending on development 
					projects will give a major boost to demand for equipment and 
					working capital financing. These projects would also benefit 
					the subcontractors &amp; SMEs,” adds Engineer.</td>

					<img border="0" src="images/cover06.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="200" height="176">C B Ganesh, deputy CEO, ahlibank brings in a 
					global context to the State budget. “You need not be an 
					economist to say that government’s austerity measures and 
					spending cuts lead to unemployment and lower GDP growth, if 
					not stagnation,” avers Ganesh. When the private sector is 
					hesitant to spend and has gone into a shell, governments 
					across the world needs to spend to stimulate the economy. I 
					think this is where the Euro zone is faltering. In this 
					context, the Sultanate’s deficit budget 2013 is a bold move 
					in the right direction.”<br>
					<br>
					“The projected government spending will definitely stimulate 
					the economy and create more employment opportunities. 
					Infrastructure development needs to precede any economic 
					prosperity (as exemplified by China and learned by India the 
					hard way) and hence, Oman’s budget focus on roads, airports 
					and sea ports is laudable,” adds Ganesh.<br>
					<br>
					The various infrastructure projects announced will lead to 
					further unification of the GCC markets which could result in 
					increased flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the 
					country. Considering the demographic profile of Oman, in my 
					view, education should get precedence over health in budget 
					allocations, Ganesh points out.</td>

					<img border="0" src="images/cover07.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="200" height="176">Sometimes it is a clichéd statement but really 
					speaking the direction of the government laid out by the 
					vision of His Majesty is so fantastic, says Dr Shirish Gupte, 
					CEO, ICT Kitara Capital. “The government’s strategy is that 
					we will spend on the infrastructure. As a result of this, 
					when the government spends, it’s the private sector which is 
					going to get the benefits. So it is then important that the 
					private sector also plays its role in the overall 
					development of the nation. I think that time has to come for 
					people to expect reasonable profits. Its time everybody woke 
					up to the fact that there is no cheap labour any longer. 
					Start concentrating on productivity and efficiency rather 
					than on salaries. Start improving the skill sets of people 
					as even the government is concentrating its efforts on 
					education and training,” Gupte adds.<br>
					<br>
					Training will lead to more jobs, more wealth, more stability 
					and development of the country, he says.The other 
					interesting part is that a well developed infrastructure 
					will be the key to attract foreign direct investment into 
					the country, says Gupte.</td>

					created will result in retail lending opportunities. 
					Increased government borrowings through government 
					development bonds (GDBs) could help in creating a much 
					needed benchmark yield curve for Omani riyals.<br>
					<br>
					Project approvals and execution is expected to further 
					accelerate, helping the business sector and in particular 
					the small business contractors. As the private sector is a 
					direct beneficiary of the economic activity generated by 
					government spending, the 29 per cent increase in expenditure 
					should create good business opportunities, Kabir adds. <br>
					<br>
					From a macro-economic point of view, Budget 2013 continues 
					to build upon the Sultanate’s growth story with an enhanced 
					outlay on infrastructure projects, renewed focus on social 
					spending and efforts to promote small and medium 
					enterprises. This coupled with an expected $100 plus per 
					barrel oil price, is a firm affirmation that Oman’s finances 
					and economic policy are headed in the right direction.&#8194;</td>

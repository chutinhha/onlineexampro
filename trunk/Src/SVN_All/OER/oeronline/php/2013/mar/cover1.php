					<img border="0" src="images/cover_6.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="200" height="176">About the repercussions of the hike in minimum wages, HE Tawfeeq Abdulhussain Juma al Lawati, representative of Muttrah at Majlis A’Shura, says that the other thing which he has heard is that the new recruits will start from RO350. If the senior people who have been working in an organisation, get a hike to RO325, but a new appointee gets RO350, then the existing ones will resign and get a new job or demand parity. According to him, there are different segments in the economy while some companies are more mature and can easily absorb the hike in minimum wages, SMEs are the ones which are going to be hit badly and they might not be able to afford this kind of salary and may eventually run out of business. There is a standing Shura Council formula to hike the minimum wages, which  would minimise the impact on the private sector (see box ‘The Majlis A’Shura formula for private sector’).<br>
					<br>
					
“With the cost of manpower going up, it is only natural that there will be a cascading effect on the price of goods, but the consumer protection authority will not allow this. I agree that there should not be a price increase across the board, but there are segments which are technology-intensive and others which are labour-intensive like the services sector. We need to review and see what is the impact or the authority should do a product-by-product research and see where the prices can be increased,” adds HE Tawfeeq.
<br>
					<br>
					Hassan Mohammed Juma, managing director, Mohammed Juma Sultan Company says that as a company, they suffer only on the construction side due to the recent hike. “I can recruit Omanis but they are not willing to work, so the government has to waive off certain things taking into consideration the cultural mores of the country. We are paying above the minimum wages in the rest of the group. But in construction we are hit because expatriates are coming in for lesser wages, so the cost parameters are not right. Moreover, it’s all about inflation. If I am going to get a better rate for my contract, it is fine. Construction should not be put in the same bracket as other industries because of the unwillingness of Omanis to take up jobs in this sector. I am willing to take, even if they do 40 per cent of the job, but we struggle to get enough people. In construction, a RO325-350 salary is not feasible at all.”</td>

					<img border="0" src="images/cover_2.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="200" height="176">The impact of the hike in minimum wages would be very high unless the salary hike is really subsidised by the government, says Bhaskar Dutta, CEO, Al Jazeera Steel. Continuing further, he says that without any vocational training, a school leaving pupil from class 10-12 with no job knowledge, getting this high a salary is not appropriate. When asked if the new wage structure is a reality with which companies will have to live with, Dutta says, if the SMEs are not subsidised, this wage burden in the competitive market condition will push a lot of SMEs to close down in the near future.<br>
					<br>
					Hilal bin Hamad al Ahsani, CEO, PEIE, counters by saying that in any industrial development, there are positive and negative impacts. What do we have to do? In America, Europe and Far East markets, wages are always fluctuating; but here at least the minimum wage is fixed. We need to apply efficiency and also cost reductions. <br>
					<br>
					One has to analyse each of the elements contributing to production cost in the industry and you can see that not many of these industries will be affected. Only the really small industries will be impacted in the short run, but in the long run, they can revisit and shift their cost analysis and strategy. Yes, there will be some sort of decline, but this will be limited to the short term.</td>

					Most of the industrialists are of the opinion that the authorities are penalising everyone for the mistakes of errant companies by generalising the rules across the economic sectors. Moreover, by increasing minimum wages to a higher level compared to other countries, the country is encouraging the rise of an uneducated class in society. Says Hussain, “We have to understand that various people from different backgrounds, and in some segments education may not be a priority. A minimum salary assurance may deter certain parents from imparting education to their children for 18 years to get paid RO600, compared to a choice of earning RO350 from day one.”<br>
					<br>
					“We are not touching the major critical issues. Why are Omanis reluctant to work for Omani companies? Can we place our finger on what is a motivating salary for an Omani? If yes, can the private sector companies pay this and survive? What is the output of the Omani individual as compared to an expatriate? All these issues need to be discussed and documented and a decision should be taken based on these conclusions,” Tawfeeq points out. “There is a need for a coordinated approach as most government agencies like the OCCI, PEIE, Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are all working in silos presently,” adds Tawfeeq.
		<br />
		<br />
		Continuing further, he observes that there is no taskforce to oversee the consequential effects of government decisions, as the overriding objective seems to be to hire Omanis and to pay them more, without looking at the ramifications. As a result there will be companies which will close down, because of their inability to pay more, which in turn will lead to more Omanis looking for jobs.
Everyone knows the government risks courting a social problem if there are thousands of unemployed and dissatisfied youth, but hiking minimum salaries to unaffordable levels is not a panacea for socio-economic problems. Amidst all this, it seems that it is better to agree that the glass is both half full and half empty and it is better to ensure that the glass gets topped up without breaking it!&#8194;

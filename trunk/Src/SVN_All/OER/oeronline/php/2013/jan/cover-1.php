				Tim Sebastian: Before I speak to the panellists, I would like to 
				get the views of the audience. <br>
				<br>
				<b>How far is Oman future ready and what should the priorities 
				be?</b><br>
				Audience (Wael Lawati): Creating jobs for the youth is a 
				priority as 70 per cent of our population is under the age of 
				40. It should start from an early age and we need not wait till 
				the University level. There is a need to recreate the natural 
				spirit of entrepreneurship of our forefathers. Omanis have lost 
				that spirit of entrepreneurship, due to our cushy jobs. The 
				government’s plans to promote SME development need to be 
				strengthened and there needs to be a feeling that one can create 
				one’s own destiny instead of just queuing up for a government 
				job.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Sir, how business friendly is Oman?<br>
				</b>Audience: In many ways it is, but it depends on what we 
				compare it to. Compared with our regional peers, we are doing 
				fine, but there are challenges and a lot needs to be done. 
				Creating employment and training the young workforce and keeping 
				up the pace of development in the face of depleting resources 
				should be our priorities. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: How far are a burgeoning public sector and a declining 
				private sector a cause of concern for you?</b><br>
				Audience: There are definitely new ways of collaboration, but 
				certainly it is a big worry at the moment. The overwhelming 
				dependency of the economy on the petrochemical sector is a cause 
				for concern in the face of depleting oil and gas resources and 
				there is a need to diversify the base of the economy, probably 
				towards the financial sector. <br>
				<br>
				Audience: The Omani workforce should be given practical training 
				and the standard of education from primary education till the 
				university level needs to improve. In the last three years, 
				things are moving in the right direction, but the pace of change 
				needs to quicken. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Manal Al-Abdwani, you heard some of the concerns of the 
				audience: jobs, too much red tape and perhaps not being business 
				friendly enough compared to other countries in the Gulf. How 
				would you react to that? </b><br>
				Manal Al-Abdwani: I agree with the audience on some of these 
				issues. If we talk about job creation, this is definitely 
				priority No 1 for Oman right now. But let’s put things in 
				perspective. If you look at the data coming from IMF and local 
				sources, we find that on an average 40,000 to 45,000 jobs need 
				to be created every year. Is this difficult to achieve? Let’s 
				look at where they can be employed. If we look at the success 
				stories so far it has been in the banking sector, oil and gas, 
				health and education; so Omanis are looking for certain types of 
				jobs, which offer growth prospects, good remuneration etc. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Why do a larger number of expatriate workers come into the 
				country? At last count over 100,000 new expat workers have come 
				into the country last year.<br>
				<br>
				Manal: This is because we have a lot of infrastructure projects 
				going on and a lot of development around construction and 
				manufacturing. The nature of the economy does not sustain the 
				inclusion of Omanis based on the aspirations they have. So there 
				is a need to see how we can include more Omanis in the type of 
				economy that is being developed. So we need to see how we can 
				include more Omanis in the type of economy that we want to 
				develop. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: This has been an issue for some time now or have you 
				come into it now?<br>
				</b>Manal: No, we have not come into it now; what we are seeing 
				is that there is a need to act now. Now that we know the number 
				of Omanis who need to be employed every year, let’s look at 
				where they can be included. For example the construction sector 
				has been able to employ only 60,000 Omanis, while there are 
				600,000 expatriates in that sector, so we have been able to 
				employ only 10 per cent of the labour force. Compared with this, 
				the retail sector seems more appealing as there are 40,000 
				Omanis in that sector.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: HE Tawfeeq al Lawati, I am sure this is an urgent issue 
				now, but I would like to present it in a different way. Forty 
				years ago, when we started the Renaissance, we did not have 
				enough skilled and qualified people, so bringing in expatriates 
				was a necessity and a must, but after 40 years we need to change 
				the formula.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So why is this still going on?<br>
				</b>HE Tawfeeq: This is the point that I would like to raise. It 
				should not sound like that we should try to include Omanis. The 
				message to everyone should be that expatriates are not an option 
				and we have to survive with Omanis; and with this in view we 
				should put forward what is required from the government and what 
				is required from the private sector. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: There are some concerns vis-à-vis their education and 
				whether Omanis are in a position to take on the jobs of the 
				expatriates?<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: If the education is not efficient, then we need to 
				revise the educational process. Right now this is not up to the 
				mark; there are a lot of complaints about the standard of basic 
				education and higher education. HE the Vice Chancellor of the 
				Sultan Qaboos University, which takes the cream of the students, 
				came to the Majlis A’Shura and said that students required a 
				two-year foundation course before they can join the University.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: This is still the case?<br>
				</b>HE Tawfeeq: Yes this is still the case. We have a genuine 
				problem and we have to identify where the problem is. Today we 
				spend almost RO1bn on education which is almost 8-10 per cent of 
				the yearly budget, but we are not getting the qualitative 
				outcome.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: You have the director general of planning and follow-up 
				here. What according to you should be the priority No 1? </b>
				<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: The priority No 1 for me should be Omanis; we should 
				focus on them and all our plans should focus on serving Omanis, 
				whether it is in education, health services or any other service 
				that the government provides. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: What I am trying to get to is that, what is the 
				government not doing and what should it do? </b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Today, we have a higher committee for economic 
				planning, and we would like to listen to them in terms of what 
				they are proposing. What we have today in education is oriented 
				towards individuals. When a new minister comes, there is a lot 
				of change in the manpower and the leaders, but there is no 
				genuine change in the competency or skills that the students are 
				expected to master to join the workforce.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Abdulaziz al Baluhsi, what are your major concerns?<br>
				</b>AbdulAziz: The first question that we need to ask is whether 
				unemployment is a big issue or it is something that we ourselves 
				create. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Is it a big issue? Probably at 24 per cent unemployment is 
				a big issue. <br>
				<br>
				AbdulAziz: Is it really 24 per cent? And this is a question that 
				we need to ask. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: What in your opinion is the right unemployment figure?<br>
				</b><br>
				<b>AbdulAziz: If the figure is correct then we need to ask who 
				the unemployed are- are they University graduates or only the 
				people who do not want to work?<br>
				</b><br>
				<b>Tim: Or is it people waiting for lucrative government jobs, 
				rather than taking lower paid jobs in the private sector?</b><br>
				AbdulAziz: Yes. So we need to analyse the data and see where the 
				problem lies rather than just saying that this is the big 
				problem. The major problem is that today we are talking about 
				our challenges without any in-depth analyses of the problems. 
				The government and private sector have to work together to go 
				deeper and find the roots of the problem. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: It sounds fine in theory but what does it mean in 
				concrete terms? </b><br>
				AbdulAziz: In theory it is fine, but in practical terms if all 
				of us have an open mind things would work better.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: Nobody has said that you should not work together.<br>
				<br>
				AbdulAziz: We could work closer and better. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: What are the concrete steps or results that we should be 
				taking about in a year’s time?<br>
				</b>AbdulAziz: Look at the banking sector. In the sector 90 per 
				cent of the workforce comprises Omanis: you have successful CEOs 
				and heads of IT and compliance who are all Omanis. So let’s look 
				at how Omanis have been so successful in the banking sector and 
				replicate that model in other sectors. So we can work together 
				and there is a model that is working. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: If this has worked in the banking sector, then why have 
				the other sectors not done the same?</b><br>
				AbdulAziz: That’s a question that we have to ask.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: What’s the answer, because we are not just asking 
				question but are looking for answers?</b><br>
				Manal: On the point of why it is working in the banking sector: 
				it works because Oman is one of the first countries to create a 
				good training institute for the banking sector (College for 
				Banking and Financial Services) and that has created the 
				workforce needed in this sector.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Is this model replicable in other sectors?<br>
				</b>Manal: Let’s go through it. The banking sector remunerates 
				well; it has good growth prospects and provides the kind of job 
				that Omanis aspire for. There are certain sectors that seem to 
				be successful in attracting Omanis- banking is one; oil and gas, 
				education and health are catching up. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: The oil and gas sector has seen a lot of unrest this 
				year, sit-ins and strikes?<br>
				</b>Manal: We are expecting 8000 jobs to be created for Omanis 
				in the oil and gas sector this year, so we need to focus on 
				those sectors which match the aspirations of Omanis. The other 
				area that we need to focus on is our successful businesses today 
				– whether they are the family businesses or the bigger 
				industries, or government industries and businesses. The 
				government and companies should look at the nature of their 
				businesses, see the value chain and the kind of opportunities 
				that can be created within these companies. His Excellency spoke 
				about outsourcing and the possibilities of subcontracting and 
				partnerships in his keynote address, so there is a lot that can 
				be done by these companies as initiators of&nbsp; small 
				enterprises. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: We will speak about this in detail in a while. Stephen 
				Thomas, what keeps you awake at night regarding the future of 
				Oman? </b><br>
				Stephen: The subjects that my colleagues on the panel have 
				already touched upon- it is about employment and creating jobs 
				for Omanis. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: You have spoken about a human resources nightmare?</b><br>
				Stephen: I am not saying that it is a nightmare but there are 
				issues. The future economic prosperity of Oman depends on how 
				many Omanis are in the workforce and that is a problem for all 
				of us as it also depends on how productive they are in that 
				work. And given the examples that Manal has given it does show 
				that it is possible to have those success stories and there are 
				Omanis working successfully at every level of the economy. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Omanis make up only 40 per cent of the private sector, 
				which is expected to generate the real wealth of this nation!<br>
				<br>
				Stephen: The private sector can step up its efforts in 
				generating more employment for Omanis in some areas, where they 
				have not been successful in developing an Omani workforce, but 
				there are other issues as well. The burgeoning public sector 
				that you mentioned in the question at the beginning of the 
				debate is a challenge for the private sector. We want less 
				government and less red tape, not a growing government in order 
				to create wealth, because that’s the reason why the private 
				sector is there. And it has not helped the private sector in 
				various sectors to develop their own Omani workforce because 
				there has been an outflow of people from the private sector to 
				government jobs that have been created in the last year and as 
				His Majesty has said the creation of jobs in the public sector 
				is not sustainable. So it is about job creation. Manal has given 
				the example of the oil and gas sector, which I am aware of. Even 
				if we manage to Omanise every single job in that sector there 
				are 25,000 people working directly and 40,000 people working 
				outside the fence. It is not going to solve the next year’s 
				intake problem. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: How do you react to Tawfeeq al Lawati’s statement saying 
				that every job in the country should be Omanised?</b><br>
				Stephen: I think His Excellency’s comment is an idea for 
				everyone. Private sector would want to have a local workforce as 
				a most efficient way of operating any business anywhere in the 
				world. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: You are on record stating expatriates are not a 
				commodity to be Omanised?</b><br>
				Stephen: I don’t believe they are. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Do you think you are being used that way?</b><br>
				Stephen: I do believe that we should look at expatriates who are 
				here; and they should be here because they are in a job for 
				which there is not a skilled equivalent in terms of an Omani.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: The comment suggests that you feel undervalued here; do 
				expatriates feel undervalued here?</b><br>
				Stephen: It is possible, if you get a general statement like 
				expatriates are not an option anymore and it should only be 
				Omanis going forward. That’s well and good if there are Omanis 
				who are future ready, with the human resources.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: And are they ready?</b><br>
				Stephen: No, they are not. There is more that the private sector 
				should do. His Excellency the Minister spoke about every sector 
				getting its own training institutes, so there is a lot that the 
				private sector can do. But at the moment we are not future 
				ready. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: let me take up a question coming on Twitter and let me 
				pose it to Ahmed al Wahaibi- Are Omanis qualified to take on new 
				jobs?</b><br>
				Ahmed: In short, yes.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Despite the reservations that HE Tawfeeq raised in terms 
				of education?</b><br>
				Ahmed: Let me first comment a bit about Omanisation. Omanisation 
				has come to acquire a negative connotation. As locals, we are 
				entitled to a job. If someone gives to an Omani a job it is seen 
				as a favour. This perception should change as Omanis have a 
				right to get a job. Preparing an Omani for a job is a natural 
				thing to do and it is good for the economy. Secondly it is good 
				to see more expatriates in the country as we are a growing 
				economy.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So you think having more expatriates is a good sign?</b><br>
				Ahmed: Yes, I think. If we get our policies right ,then if we 
				have more expatriates, it shows that there is trust in the 
				country. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Come back to the issue of whether Omanis are qualified.<br>
				<br>
				Ahmed: Yes they are. In Oman Oil Company we have 7,000 people 
				out of which 74 per cent are local and they are in highly 
				technical jobs and they include business leaders and CEOs. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Tawfeeq al Lawati, would you agree with this view point?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: My point is that the problem is with the attitude. 
				The attitude is since we have access to expatriates, why we 
				should prepare Omanis, train them and do the hard work. This is 
				the attitude of the private sector. The private sector needs to 
				be informed that, “We are now in 2012 and you give us your 
				business plan for the next eight years detailing how you are 
				going to Omanise your workforce.” I am not saying we have to do 
				it overnight, we are not equipped to do it overnight. But over 
				the next eight years you ask me what resources you need for the 
				purpose. We are investing millions of rials in infrastructure, 
				highways and ports. The most important and valuable asset for 
				the country is the Omani citizen and we cannot have all this 
				while still depending on expats. We had a crisis during the Gulf 
				War when a number of expatriates went out to work as they were 
				paid higher or when they moved out because of the political 
				risks. We have to depend on our people for our future.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Let me put the same question to you – Are Omanis 
				qualified to take on new jobs?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: No, at this point and this is our challenge. We need 
				to have a plan for the next 8-10 years. The government has to 
				invest in partnership with the private sector. They have to 
				identify each organisation and what are the positions available. 
				I don’t want Omanis to be working only for low-paid jobs, we 
				have to tackle, mid-management and top-management jobs. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Another question coming up on Twitter – Where does the 
				capacity building plan stand at the end of 2012, ready for 
				higher levels of Omanisation? </b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Omanis are not available totally, but we need to 
				prepare them. The private sector is not taking this initiative 
				today. There are companies which are dependent on government 
				subsidies in terms of gas and other subsidised services. If we 
				recruit management trainees and invest in them, even government 
				companies like Mr Ahmed al Wahaibi’s company should work as 
				hatcheries from whom the private sector can recruit Omani 
				leaders. Even banks hire only for their needs; it is all about 
				balance sheet, profit and loss. Companies from the public and 
				private sectors should be socially responsible; they should 
				recruit more Omanis and train them.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: Do you think that Oman’s planning is coherent; you have 
				gone on record saying that Oman had a plan called 2020, but 
				after five or six years it disappeared and it needs revision.<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Vision 2020 is still mentioned but it is irrelevant 
				today. Vision 2020 was drawn up when oil prices were $17 per 
				barrel, while oil prices today are at $107 per barrel. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Does the plan exist today?<br>
				</b>HE Tawfeeq: The plan exists but it is not relevant; it 
				should have been revised based on the facts. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Manal, do you want to respond to that? Do you think that 
				the plan should have been revised?</b><br>
				Manal: I totally agree and there are a number of steps being 
				taken in this direction. The Higher Council of Planning is 
				taking great efforts...<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So when are we going to see a new plan?</b><br>
				Manal: It is going to be available very soon and a lot of 
				discussions are going on around it.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Weeks, days, months?<br>
				</b>Manal: His Excellency the Minister is here and you could ask 
				him.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: I would actually like to ask His Excellency Ali Al Sunaidi 
				the Minister of Commerce and Industry as to when the new plan is 
				expected. <br>
				HE Ali Al Sunaidi: Thank you for inviting me to the debate. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: (Laughs) We wouldn’t have it any other way.<br>
				HE Ali Al Sunaidi: First of all thank you, you are doing a 
				brilliant job and I am very fascinated by the spirit of the 
				debate. Let me say that Vision 2020 still survives because the 
				ports that are under construction are in that plan. The 
				concessions that the government gave are a part of 2020. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: It’s a bit worrying, if the Majlis A’Shura does not know 
				that the plan is still relevant.<br>
				HE Ali Al Sunaidi: He did not say that (alluding to HE Tawfeeq), 
				he said that it is out of sync, and I agree with that, because 
				the plan at that time was all about hardware or infrastructure. 
				Starting from this year as we prepare for the five-year plan and 
				I agree that during the course of this five- year plan the 
				government should announce a new vision; that’s already on 
				board, it’s been discussed at various levels. <br>
				<br>
				<b>(Audience applause)<br>
				Tim: Is there a time table for it?</b><br>
				HE Ali Al Sunaidi: I would not comment on it, as it is not 
				appropriate to do so here. Thank you. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Let’s take the first vote of the day and let’s make it 
				on the essential question of the debate – Is Oman future ready? 
				The results are here: 73 per cent of the audience think that 
				Oman is not future ready while 27 per cent of the audience think 
				it is. Manal, that’s worrying to you?</b><br>
				Manal: It is worrying because we should recognise that we did 
				achieve something and I would like to state what we have 
				achieved...<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: But there seems to be a huge lack of confidence in this 
				room?</b><br>
				Manal: Just allow me to state why we are future ready and on 
				what basis.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Would you first please react to the vote and the lack of 
				confidence that it seems to suggest?</b><br>
				Manal: I know where that worry is coming from. It stems from the 
				fact that we had worries about dealing with unemployment and 
				whether Omanis are ready for inclusion in the economy. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: This room has very influential people, and if 73 per 
				cent of them are worried that Oman is not future ready then you 
				are not getting your message across to people who need to hear 
				it?</b><br>
				Manal: So let me get my message across. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Please, I was putting things in context (audience laughter 
				and applause)...<br>
				Manal: My message would be based on the perception of certain 
				international institutions to Oman. I would not like to 
				substantiate my statement based on what I feel. The World 
				Economic Forum (WEF) and the World Bank always promote a sound 
				economic framework and I am quoting what comes out of their 
				reports. Oman has been sustaining since 1970 an average growth 
				rate of 6.2 per cent, envisaging 7 per cent next year. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: IMF also says you are creating too many government jobs.<br>
				Manal: That’s correct. The second area where we are strong is 
				infrastructure. Out of RO15bn of planned expenditure, RO9bn is 
				going into infrastructure, ports, airports, railways and so on. 
				Oman is ranked 21 as far as the quality of infrastructure is 
				concerned by the WEF, 10 in roads and 33 in ports. So this is an 
				area where we have achieved much. We are continuously growing in 
				terms of economic zones, in addition to Duqm which is coming up 
				with concurrent projects worth $4.3bn, which will be operational 
				in a year or two.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: So you have given us a plug as to what you are doing, so 
				come back to the vote.<br>
				Manal: So today we have a formula for the private sector to get 
				engaged and to expand its business – this is what I am trying to 
				say.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: But it isn’t. It is going the other way.<br>
				Manal: With regards to the reforms that we have taken such as 
				the labour market, some perceive them negatively, and have a 
				hard time digesting them; but now we have realised that they 
				have benefitted the economy. Today, there is higher purchasing 
				power in the hands of many Omanis and the retail sector and the 
				hotel sector is flourishing. <br>
				<b><br>
				Tim: Tawfeeq al Lawati, why is not this happy message getting 
				across?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: First we should accept the fact that the cup is more 
				than half full; no one can deny the achievements of the last 40 
				years. But we should not play the tricky game of numbers. If the 
				numbers are so fancy then why we went through the crisis and 
				protests last year and why it is still going on. There are gaps 
				between what the government has been advocating for the last 40 
				years and people’s expectations. I am talking about a more fair 
				distribution of wealth. What is the average income of an Omani 
				family? What is the poverty line and how many people are living 
				below this line? I was expecting one line from HE the Minister 
				stating that we are proud of all the highways, ports, roads. He 
				is the key person in the Higher Committee for Planning. But what 
				about the welfare of the Omani citizen? The focal point of every 
				policy should be the socio-economic welfare of the Omani 
				citizens. In all our plans there has been an imbalance between 
				spending on infrastructure development and spending on social 
				infrastructure and this should be corrected. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Abdulaziz al Balushi, your concerns about the vote?<br>
				</b>Abdulaziz: I am not surprised and we should not be 
				complacent. We should not fool ourselves by stating that we are 
				ready when we know that still a lot needs to be done. HE 
				mentioned that we are still dependent on expatriates; yes we are 
				still dependent on expats and that is a reality. The future is a 
				moving target, and it is going forward. We can’t say that we are 
				future ready, when so many things still need to be done. We have 
				started improving and we are going towards our target. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Stephen Thomas, on the vote and the extent of concern?<br>
				</b>Stephen: It is a concern and I believe that the vote is 
				probably correct not just in terms of the mix of opinions. 
				Twenty-five per cent of the job is done while 75 per cent is 
				still to be done.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Do you detect in Oman a willingness to do what has to be 
				done?<br>
				</b>Stephen: There is but there are a few things that need to 
				change. Sticking to this major issue of employment and job 
				creation, obviously we need to create wealth and SMEs. Something 
				can be done in the education system to help the private sector. 
				In education if there is a real focus on English, Numeracy and 
				Computer skills up to the age of 14 years, the payoff for the 
				private sector down the line would be far greater. There are 
				some little changes that need to be made to make us future 
				ready, but right now it isn’t as if the private sector can wave 
				a magic wand and put everyone into jobs. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Do you think the government is complacent here?<br>
				</b>Stephen: In the government there is no complacency, but a 
				real worry that things have to be done and all of us have to 
				work towards getting Omanis into meaningful employment; but 
				everyone needs to understand that it means productive 
				employment.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: And don’t you think that a burgeoning public sector 
				provides meaningful employment?<br>
				Stephen: No, I don’t. In the civil service you see a lot of 
				people working hard and diligently to get things done; and then 
				there are people who are doing absolutely nothing and that is 
				not a meaningful job and that is not the right message to the 
				private sector or to Omanis who feel that they want to work for 
				the public sector because I can freeload instead of doing a real 
				job in the private sector. <br>
				<b><br>
				Tim: Let me take up that point with Manal. Who are these people 
				in the government doing nothing and what benefit is that to 
				Oman?</b><br>
				Manal: I have to agree that the government took a very reactive 
				step in the last two years in terms of employing more Omanis.
				<br>
				<br>
				Tim: But this did not deal with the underlying issues.<br>
				Manal: I agree that the government wanted to alleviate a lot of 
				social pressure and it has been able to achieve this. The 
				government wants to sustain stability in the market and to allow 
				the private sector the time to readdress the issues and start 
				the process of inclusion of Omanis. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: You gave out jobs as if they were unemployment benefits?<br>
				</b>Manal: The government is increasing its activities and what 
				we have found out is that the government is concentrating on 
				regional development, and by employing more Omanis there will be 
				an improvement of services in regional areas. The outreach of 
				our services is going to be bigger than before. So more 
				employment of Omanis in the government will help us in reaching 
				our services to places where we were not reaching before. Today 
				we talk about Musandam taking a big part of our activities, Duqm 
				where we are creating a whole new city. So the new employees 
				will be well deployed in strengthening our services. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Question coming on Twitter- is it more essential to move 
				from oil and gas industries to a more diversified economic base?
				</b><br>
				Ahmed: As Omanis we are all for diversification of the economy. 
				The oil and gas is only one pillar of the economy. We do not 
				look at the refinery or the fertiliser plant alone while looking 
				at this sector, as there is a multiplier effect.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: But we have been talking about diversification for a long 
				time in Oman, but it is not happening to the extent that the 
				government says it should happen.<br>
				<br>
				Ahmed: It has happened, because we did not have a number of 
				these industries before. So it is happening, we are selling oil 
				and gas and creating a multiplier effect in our economy. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Let’s move to the next issue raised by Tawfeeq al Lawati 
				about the unrest in Oman this year and last year; and has Oman 
				done enough to meet the demands of its people? Let’s take a vote 
				on the issue. 56 per cent of the people think it has done enough 
				while 44 per cent think it has not. Stephen Thomas, your 
				reactions?<br>
				<br>
				Stephen: Yes, I do in that there was a response from the 
				government and there was a real effort made to listen to the 
				comments. But I also understand people saying no because some of 
				the quick fixes that were done like creation of extra jobs in 
				the public sector are not a sustainable answer. As a part of the 
				protest we saw unrest in the oil and gas fields-one earlier this 
				year and another last year. Industrial relations are a fairly 
				new thing in Oman and both the employer and employees could do 
				with a bit of training on how to conduct good, fair and proper 
				industrial relations. The manner in which the response was 
				conducted to the strike was an abject lesson on how not to 
				conduct industrial relations. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: So it was heavy-handed; we saw arrests, people were sent to 
				jail from 12-18 months, bloggers and online activists were 
				arrested.<br>
				<br>
				Stephen: That was not the case in protests in the oil and gas 
				industry. It is true that that happened in relation to the 
				protests in the Sohar area. In the oil and gas fields the real 
				problem was actually third party interference in what should 
				actually have been the relationship between the employer and 
				employee. There were very senior government officials who made 
				concessions to the entire workforce; all their demands were met. 
				The second time the Majlis A’Shura got involved in brokering the 
				situation between employer and employee and this is not the way 
				to conduct industrial relations. All we need from the government 
				is a legislative framework on how you can conduct strikes and 
				what a legal strike is. The strikes were themselves illegal as 
				there was no prior notification. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Let me come back to the issue of how the protests were 
				handled and bloggers and online activists were treated. You have 
				said that there is a problem with the information in Oman. You 
				say that the Ministry of Information seems to be an anachronism 
				in the modern era, in modern Oman. I think a lot of sycophancy 
				in the media is self imposed censorship and you ask, what has 
				Oman got to hide? </b><br>
				Stephen: This is a different issue.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: It is a similar issue as how Oman has reacted to 
				protests?<br>
				</b>Stephen: It is true that it is the case. For Oman, its 
				future prosperity cannot just be economic freedom that we look 
				for. There would need to be political freedom as well and there 
				are measures being done for this. I don’t know as to what Oman 
				has to hide. It has a great new story, as Manal pointed out the 
				best development story over the last 40 years worldwide; and we 
				have a wonderful head of state who is universally respected and 
				loved. So what is there to worry about? <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Let Manal take up that point; whether there is a heavy 
				handed response to criticism in Oman?</b><br>
				Manal: What happened in this part of the world is true for all 
				of us and it was a new learning experience for the government, 
				people, the Majlis A’Shura on how to deal with these issues and 
				we have come a long way since then.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So were the jail terms handed out to online activists 
				and bloggers a mistake?<br>
				</b>Manal: There is a learning curve that we need to go through. 
				In these issues we need to strike a balance between being very 
				lenient and being very restrictive and where does it really lead 
				you to. We all learnt since the protests in Sohar. We learnt 
				that we need to allow space of freedom of expression and 
				communication; but it needs to be done in the right manner.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: But Oman’s reputation for openness has been damaged. 
				Amnesty International is saying that the sentences are the 
				latest phase in the Omani government’s orchestrated crackdown on 
				the freedom of expression and assembly. Is that the kind of 
				signal that you are happy to send out to the rest of the world?<br>
				</b><br>
				Manal: There was a misuse of a number of those channels; and a 
				number of people and institutions got hurt just because of false 
				arguments being made without any justification. <br>
				Tim: So Human Rights organisations have got it wrong?<br>
				<br>
				Manal: There is a learning curve, for the government, bloggers 
				and everyone as there are international guidelines on how you 
				bring about your views to the public. This should not take us a 
				long time and this should be done in a year’s time and we have 
				allowed a law to be introduced in this area and today we have a 
				good foundation for the freedom of speech. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Stephen Thomas...<br>
				Stephen: We know from models around the world and I know that 
				there are cultural differences; but here Omani culture helps in 
				that there is direct link between a real surge in economic 
				progress and freedom of information. The push back from 
				disagreements and opposition is a very positive thing. If we had 
				that freedom in the traditional media and inside that space 
				there is nothing to fear. The benefit to Oman is its standing in 
				the world which is great, coupled with a wonderful foreign 
				policy. We want to be citizens of the world economy and its 
				institutions; all this will flow from that. The culture of Oman 
				is the DNA for this, because it lies in tribal and family values 
				and Islamic values and these will always be a far better filter 
				to absorb any negative connotations that come with open 
				information than censorship and suppression of information. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Tawfeeq al Lawati, did the government use a heavy handed 
				approach to criticism?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: I would say that there have been some excesses, but 
				I would not term them as heavy. After the protests in Sohar and 
				the consequential ones and before we came (to the Shura), as it 
				is our first term, there have been some changes in the laws 
				related to the IT and the media, which made it more difficult 
				for people to express their views. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: And you don’t approve it?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Definitely, we should have more freedom of 
				expression rather than making it more controlled. I personally 
				told the Inspector General of police when we met him after the 
				arrest of the activists that globally people breathe the same 
				oxygen and today our people are on the net, twitter and watch 
				satellite channels. We cannot restrict them to the same values 
				that we were following 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Yes, we need to 
				have more tolerance. I disagree with Manal. For 40 years we have 
				been going on one frequency, suddenly when there is a change in 
				the frequency, there should be tolerance and then there should 
				be a balance. Some of these activists are lawyers, technocrats 
				and in high positions, they are not just people from the street 
				and they were advocating views for the benefit of people. I 
				don’t deny that there have been some violations but we should 
				have shown tolerance as exemplified by the Omani tradition, and 
				allowed them a chance for dialogue and communication. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: So should the authorities have been more tolerant? We have 
				the Minister of Information HE Dr Abdulmunim Al Hasani in the 
				audience. I don’t know whether he would like to comment on the 
				issue. Sir, there is a member of the Majlis A’Shura who feels 
				that there should have been more tolerance; how would you react 
				to that?<br>
				<br>
				HE Dr Abdulmunim: Thank you very much and I am very glad to be 
				here, listening to the open debate. It is important for us to 
				listen to each other. In any country freedom of speech is a 
				dream world. What happened in Oman can in no way be termed as 
				being heavy handed. There was an open dialogue between the 
				citizens and the government in general and there were many 
				programmes discussing issues on radio, television and in the 
				print media. There are some rules and laws and they have to be 
				respected. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Minister, you are being accused by an internationally 
				respected human rights organisation of trying to stamp out 
				dissent. That’s not the message that you would want to send out 
				to the outside world. <br>
				<br>
				HE Dr Abdulmunim: These kind of reports can be applied to many 
				other countries in the world. Any government in the world has to 
				protect its interests. Even in the US or Europe if there are 
				street protests which are illegal these will be dealt with in 
				accordance with the law.<br>
				Tim: You have not seen people being sentenced to jail for 12-18 
				months for criticising the government. <br>
				<br>
				HE Dr Abdulmunim: Even in Britain and the US if people came onto 
				the streets and demolish structures or attacked institutions, 
				the government will be forced to deal with the issue. <br>
				Tim: Do you reject the charge from Amnesty International? <br>
				<br>
				HE Dr Abdulmunim: We would not like to reject, but let us 
				discuss the issue openly. <br>
				Tim: We have a Majlis A’Shura member here who thinks that the 
				authorities should have shown more tolerance.<br>
				<br>
				HE Dr Abdulmunim: Not all of these reports are very accurate and 
				we have to deal with them. We are trying to open this dialogue 
				with each other, but even if a minister does anything against 
				the law, then he will be held accountable. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Thank you Mr Minister. Abdulaziz al Balushi, do you share 
				Tawfeew al Lawati’s position on the response being very heavy 
				handed.<br>
				<br>
				Abdulaziz: We need to differentiate between character 
				assassination and freedom of expression. If there is some false 
				information that will create instability in the country, that is 
				not constructive freedom of expression. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Freedom of expression is also the freedom to get it 
				wrong?</b><br>
				Abdulaziz: But you have to be careful whether what you are 
				saying is true or not. I share the views of His Excellency the 
				Minister.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: Criticism is a matter of opinion, and people should be 
				allowed to voice those.<br>
				<br>
				Abdulaziz: You need positive criticism and not negative 
				criticism. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: So who is to decide what is positive or negative criticism? 
				Shouldn’t people be allowed to express their opinions?<br>
				<br>
				Abdulaziz: The debate that we are having today is constructive 
				criticism as we are making arguments based on facts and people 
				can freely say what they want to say. But when you come to 
				character assassination or spreading false information, that is 
				not constructive criticism or freedom of expression.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Is it worth going to jail, if it is not constructive 
				criticism?</b><br>
				Abdulaziz: We don’t want people to go to jail. First of all you 
				need to know that freedom of expression is very new in this 
				country; so we have to go ahead in stages rather than allowing 
				everyone to say what they want to say. <br>
				<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Let’s be a bit more specific. There were cases here 
				of a few people insulting His Majesty and that is unacceptable 
				to everyone, and this is common for all Omanis. There were other 
				issues that were subjective. Today, I am raising issues, so 
				tomorrow I can be labelled as being anti government and that I 
				am trying to create disturbances. But we should not go down to 
				this level. We should believe in the wisdom of the Omani people. 
				Omani people came out on the streets and pledged their 
				allegiance to His Majesty even in Sohar. There is a difference 
				between people having loyalty to His Majesty and their 
				expressing differences with the government over policy issues.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Which you think they should be allowed to do?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Yes, today we talk about a partnership between the 
				government and the people. The government should reflect the 
				aspirations of people and do what is necessary for them. For 
				example, why were projects in Musandam delayed till people came 
				onto the streets? If you don’t listen to people and do not 
				prioritise their needs, then you push them to the last square, 
				forcing them to come out and speak. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Let me ask Manal to react to this – you pushed people 
				onto the streets?</b><br>
				Manal: I am right now in the hot seat.<br>
				Tim: I can change seats (laughs). <br>
				Manal: We have provided many channels for listening to people. 
				Social media is available, most of the ministries have sections 
				or departments to deal with public opinion and people who report 
				to the minister. Today, we have hotlines for most of the 
				ministries. Some of the plans have been delayed for a long time. 
				Musandam has been on the radar for a long time and we developed 
				a master plan some time back. We must keep in mind that Oman is 
				a geographically large country and we have limited sources of 
				income, so we need to prioritise between certain regions and 
				projects. Sohar, Dhofar and Duqm took some priority and may be 
				that pushed certain regions back, but that does not mean that it 
				is not on the priority list. It’s just that there is sequence of 
				implementation of these projects. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: His point is that you are not listening to people.<br>
				Manal: We have created a good platform for listening to people.
				<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Manal, Listening to people is not an end in itself. 
				It is only a means. We need to translate the views of the people 
				into a plan of action. The 8th Five year Plan, which is now in 
				operation started in 2011 and we got the proposal in 2012 and 
				when we reviewed the budget, I have seen very minor actions 
				based on what happened on the streets. We have to come out from 
				the blue prints of the existing plans and develop a new 
				blueprint which directly serves or addresses the concerns of the 
				Omani citizens. There is still a lot of concentration on the 
				development in Muscat governorate. What we need is a fair and 
				equal distribution of services and development for all regions 
				of Oman. <br>
				<br>
				Manal: We have many plans for nation-wide development like the 
				ports, the railways etc. which are not in Muscat.<br>
				<br>
				Abdulaziz: What is the role of the Majlis A’Shura? Isn’t it the 
				role of the Majlis to get feedback from the public and share it 
				with the government?<br>
				<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Thank you for the question. What we got from the 
				budget plan is only the numbers regarding the allocations for 
				all sectors; there were no objectives. How can we review if we 
				don’t have the details? We were discussing earlier with His 
				Excellency about the budget and he mentioned that you have 
				approved the budget and I said we have passed the budget. The 
				Majlis A’Shura needs more powers and more recognition from the 
				government to represent the views of people. <br>
				<br>
				Tim: Essentially you are saying that you don’t know what you are 
				voting for? (Audience applause)<br>
				<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Yes we had reservations. The budget came in 2011. 
				The first day that we came to the Majlis we got the budget 
				against the backdrop of protests. When the budget came to us and 
				we were discussing it in the economic committee, I said, “Let’s 
				be more positive, let’s review the budget and accept it; and 
				let’s give the government a chance and see whether next year 
				they will come up with a more objective oriented budget rather 
				than just numbers and figures.” <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Was it a responsible to pass the budget without knowing 
				what it stood for?<br>
				</b>HE Tawfeeq: If you go back to the basic law of the state and 
				see the powers granted to the Majlis, you will see that we acted 
				within the authority granted to us and we expressed our opinion. 
				Our role is limited to raising proposals or giving advice rather 
				than approving or disapproving the budget.<br>
				<br>
				Audience question: Why are we continuing to peg the Omani rial 
				to the dollar over the last 45 years, when the dollar has itself 
				lost 75 per cent of its purchasing value since the time Nixon 
				unpegged it from the gold standard, because it means that the 
				rial also lost its value commensurately. But we have not had an 
				answer from the Central Bank of Oman or the concerned 
				ministries.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: We have the benefit of having the Minister of Commerce 
				and Industry here; so let’s put the question to him directly?</b><br>
				HE Sunaidi: That issue has come to the cabinet more than once 
				and a big debate took place on whether Oman should think of 
				unpegging from the dollar. When we look at the Kuwaiti model, 
				where they have deviated from the dollar peg and linked it to a 
				basket of currencies, we found that the basket is still highly 
				dependent on the dollar. This is because a large part of our 
				exports to the world has been in US dollars, because everybody 
				requires oil which is priced in US dollars. A lot of people who 
				come to us and deal with us do so in US dollars. I can 
				sympathise with the people who are in the money business and the 
				people who are buying equipment that is not priced in US 
				dollars. This was not just debated here but also in other 
				countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar etc. I agree that we should 
				have been more frank and communicated with our people about the 
				pros and cons of the dollar peg.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So you agree that you need to communicate more?</b><br>
				HE Sunaidi: Yes I do agree that the government needs to 
				communicate more.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: And should you also tell the Majlis A’Shura as to what 
				they are voting for?</b><br>
				(Audience laughter)<br>
				HE Sunaidi: That’s an issue that the Majlis has discussed with 
				the Minister of Finance, when he visited the Shura Council and 
				spent seven to eight hours there.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: It does not seem to have been resolved.<br>
				<br>
				HE Sunaidi: I think they need to visit his office again. <br>
				<br>
				Some people need to go back to the background while discussing 
				an issue like this which needs to be discussed with bankers and 
				economists. One should not talk in isolation. There should be 
				more such debates in Oman’s newspapers and you see such 
				discussions happening in the newspapers. This issue calls for 
				more transparency. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: There is a related question on twitter asking – “Will 
				the private sector be able to partner better with the government 
				if the government was more transparent?</b><br>
				HE Sunaidi: Yes, they would and I would like to say that 
				transparency should be the main issue of the next few years to 
				come.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So Mr Minister, will you come back and tell us in a 
				year’s time as to how transparent you have been? </b><br>
				HE Sunaidi: The world is watching and Oman is certainly not the 
				worst country in the world; it is amongst the top 10 in many 
				things.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: But you want it to be the best country and not amongst 
				the worst?</b><br>
				HE Sunaidi: I understand that, but it is unfair to say that 
				since you are No 5 or No 10 you are bad. One needs to understand 
				as to how come we are No 10 right now. I would conclude that 
				this debate which we should encourage shows us that we should be 
				more transparent, frank but also more active in various areas 
				and people who have been here know that this is happening.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: And I am sure your colleague the Minister of Information 
				shares your views.<br>
				HE Sunaidi: He is not just sharing this view but is doing that 
				already.<br>
				(Audience applause)<br>
				Audience question: My name is Nutayla and I work for PDO. If I 
				look at the textbooks in schools today we find that they are the 
				same ones that I had used in my childhood. If we are not going 
				to change them how are we preparing the new generation for the 
				future? <br>
				HE Tawfeeq: I agree with her. If we talk about education, a 
				month ago we had a World Bank presentation on the educational 
				system in Oman and they raised a lot of challenges based on the 
				data collected by the Ministry of Education. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So you are saying talk is cheap?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: This is the problem with us. When we raise an issue, 
				it takes a lot of time to translate it into action as we are not 
				efficient. It takes a lot of time to modify our plans and to 
				execute them. And this is our main challenge. We know that there 
				are challenges in our education system but we have not heard or 
				seen any action from the Ministry of Education to improve 
				things. When Her Excellency, the Minister of Education visited 
				the Majlis A’Shura, there was a lot of criticism about stopping 
				the integrated curriculum, which has shown good results in terms 
				of competencies, mastering skills, like reading and writing, but 
				we are still waiting for the plan of action.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim to Nutayla in the audience: Would you like to see such 
				debates set specific target or a plan of action for governments, 
				ministers and the private sector? </b><br>
				Nutayla: Plan of action needs to be communicated to the public. 
				It should also have an element of ownership in terms of who will 
				be driving that plan. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Manal al Abdwani, would you sign up to that?</b><br>
				Manal: I would sign up to that. I agree that we are lacking in 
				follow-up though the name of my department is the department of 
				follow-up. In whatever we try, irrespective of whether we 
				achieve it or fail in it, we should go back and report it to our 
				stakeholders. I hope that with the new planning agency we find a 
				way for communicating the national plan to the citizens, 
				business community and all the stakeholders, and for telling 
				them on a periodic basis that this is what we were aiming at and 
				this is what we have achieved or failed in. I do subscribe to 
				that.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: So what plan of action will you take away from this 
				session? What are you prepared to commit to till next year?</b><br>
				Manal: I would probably commit to sitting with a planning agency 
				and putting a format based on which each sector can spell out a 
				proper action plan for society. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: Within a few months of this debate?</b><br>
				Manal: This should be realistically achievable within three 
				months of this debate. <br>
				Tim: So you have nine months of implementation time and you will 
				come back to us in a year’s time and tell us what you have 
				achieved. <br>
				<br>
				Manal: Absolutely. <br>
				HH Sayyid Tarik bin Shabib: On the sidelines I and His 
				Excellency Ali Al Sunaidi were having exactly the same 
				conversation. And, Tim, as you know one of the points that I 
				raised earlier regarding the relevance of these debates lies in 
				what we can take from one year to another. And His Excellency 
				has said that he would gladly take a paper with certain 
				recommendations based on today’s debate and champion it actively 
				within the higher levels of the government. He would take on the 
				views of the people in this room today and also those coming 
				online and help us to move forward.<br>
				(Audience applause) <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: HE Tawfeeq, are you happy with that?</b><br>
				HE Tawfeeq: As a starting point, why not? My request to His 
				Excellency, who is in the higher council as the deputy chairman, 
				is that we have to focus on education, if we need to improve our 
				standards. Education, education, education! We have to visit the 
				schools; we have to sit with the students…<br>
				<br>
				Tim: Its sounds like a politician…<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Well I am a representative of the people and I see 
				the schools. We should not be result oriented, we should be 
				process oriented, and pay more attention to the environment and 
				the process of education. It is already costing us a lot. It 
				needs more attention and if we improve this process, I am sure 
				the outcome would be much better.<br>
				<br>
				Audience: I just wanted to put in a little perspective the 
				differences between developed and developing countries. Things 
				are not done overnight. If you see the track record of Oman over 
				the 42 years, a lot of things have been done with high speed. 
				Even in the education sector a lot has been done. I can give you 
				an industry perspective. I am the head of an SME. We are not in 
				oil and gas. We look for talent and we have had a lot of good 
				brains from Oman. What is exactly needed is a management 
				institute wherein we can pick up directly, train and develop 
				them. I am saying that the gap has to be bridged, between what 
				we want and what has been achieved.<br>
				<br>
				<b>One more from audience: My name is Ahmed Al Mukhaini. To what 
				extent would the Minister of Commerce and Industry regulate the 
				non-profit organisations?</b><br>
				Tim: Manal<br>
				Manal: At a personal level, I fully subscribe to his view. We 
				tried many times at the ministry to try and see if the 
				non-profit organisations are really rendering service to the 
				society and the country. So far, we have had little success in 
				getting approval for that. But I think that the whole economy 
				and the society are ready for such a question. Ahmed, if you are 
				planning to raise this question again, please come to the 
				ministry and we can put this up to the minister.<br>
				Tim: OK. Another question from the audience<br>
				<br>
				Audience: My name is Salman Al Lawati, I work for Oman Cables. I 
				just want to comment on the percentage of the new expatriates- 
				on the number of 100,000 and the 24 per cent. I think even if 
				you come next year, the number will be 200,000 and the 
				percentage would go down to 20 per cent. Why do we need to 
				analyse the percentages? Because, I believe 80 per cent is in 
				the construction sector which we cannot Omanise.<br>
				<br>
				I agree with Manal. If we go by sectors- just like oil and gas 
				banking and industry-banking is saturated with 90 per cent, well 
				done. Oil and gas is doing good. We need to focus on 
				manufacturing. That’s where we have more Omanis leaving their 
				job. We had 9000 Omanis left only last year. They went to the 
				government-created jobs. Why people are not staying in 
				manufacturing and why are they not leaving oil and gas and 
				banking jobs? Because, the government gives them some advantages 
				like interest-free loans and many other sops and benefits. So, 
				why don’t the government and the private sector and Majlis 
				A’Shura sit together and manage the people and tell them how to 
				work in the manufacturing sector. Because that’s where the 
				factories are coming and that is where the diversification is 
				going to happen…<br>
				Tim: Tawfeeq Al Lawati...<br>
				<br>
				Audience: We are having people leaving from the manufacturing…<br>
				Tim: OK. Let him answer this first<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: They are leaving the private sector because the 
				salaries given to them are based on the salaries accepted by the 
				expats. These salaries don’t satisfy the needs of the Omanis to 
				lead a minimum standard of living. So we made a proposal from 
				the Shura Council. We gave advice to the government to hire only 
				the required people, not to hire just to absorb unemployed 
				people from the street and give them a job.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: (addressing the audience questioner) You want to come 
				back on that?</b><br>
				Audience: Yes, Mr Tawfeeq, I believe the salaries have been 
				increased from RO200 to RO300, but still we are losing people. I 
				believe it is not because of the salaries. We need something…<br>
				<br>
				Tawfeeq: There is basic minimum wage required…<br>
				Audience: Even if you maintain that, here we are dealing with 
				unskilled people who have just left high school. You are not 
				dealing with university people. We need something different. We 
				need a catalyst to be kept in the industry sector so that 
				everyone will go to the industry sector and this what the 
				government need to do.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: Abdul Aziz<br>
				Abdulaziz: I agree that we have to make this sector more 
				attractive to work in. It’s not salary. It is also about other 
				motivational factors that will make them work in the 
				manufacturing sector. There are so many things that can be 
				offered to individuals such as coaching. Most of the people 
				would not know the job. But if we coach them, it will help them 
				in the long run.<br>
				HE Tawfeeq: Excuse me, Tim. In our proposal, we recommended to 
				the government to add RO150 above the salary, give a piece of 
				land and an interest free loan for those who are joining the 
				private sector. This is just to motivate the Omanis to stay and 
				work in the private sector.<br>
				<br>
				Tim: Stephen Thomas<br>
				Stephen: I think you need to look at the different companies and 
				sectors in the private sectors from where there has been a 
				migration of people to the public sector and those companies and 
				sectors from where there has not been. Now why do people join a 
				company? There will be brand equity of that company, of what it 
				is like and how progressive for an employer it is, how much it 
				values its employees and the range of benefits etc. I don’t 
				think private sector collectively has that reputation. Private 
				sector needs to work on its own brand image to become the de 
				facto place where people want to work because private sector 
				business creates the wealth and the jobs. Businesses then pay 
				the taxes and pay for the infrastructure and everything else.<br>
				<br>
				So, the salaries themselves are not the one issue. Salaries have 
				to be earned, they have to be enough. Good industrials are about 
				how we pay the highest wages but deliver the lowest prices, so 
				that Oman is competitive enough. There are pockets of excellence 
				in the private sector but private sector collectively needs to 
				get their act together on these things.</td>

                road to success started when he passed out fro<img src="images/bbms1.jpg" width="229" height="202" hspace="9" vspace="3" align="right">m 
                IIT Madras. He then did his post graduation at IIM Ahmedabad and 
                passed out in &rsquo;76. From there he worked for 26 years in 
                three family-owned groups. He started work in marketing but later 
                moved to project execution and then to general management. He 
                has worked in a variety of businesses ranging from building materials 
                to seeds to engineering products to irrigation systems. Then in 
                2002 he came to Oman and started his assignment with Khimji Ramdas 
                Group. This assignment was to oversee the operations of the infrastructure 
                group and to help synergize the operations of the various divisions. 
                Also part of the assignment was to prepare the group for the future. 
                &ldquo;Seven years down the line I am personally happy that all 
                that we set out to do we have done and far more. We have also 
                grown in terms of business, people and profitability&rdquo; says 
                Kumar.<br>
                <br>
                When it comes to managing the company, nothing gives him more 
                satisfaction than to see a person achieving his full potential. 
                &ldquo;In a workplace, what gives me utmost satisfaction is when 
                I realise people living up to their full capabilities&rdquo; says 
                Kumar. &ldquo;Many a time people don&rsquo;t release their own 
                potential. So, to be able to help them to grow and to guide them 
                gives me great pleasure&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But what puts 
                me off is people acting petty, rumour mongering and not involving 
                themselves in teamwork&rdquo; says Kumar, as he expresses his 
                strong belief in working as a team.<br>

                <b>Leaving an imprint</b><br>
                Some of the people that Vijaya Kumar admires the most are Sonia 
                Gandhi, Anand Kumar and Narayan Murti among others. Speaking on 
                Sonia Gandhi, &ldquo;The way in which she has transformed from 
                a person who did not know anything about politics to playing the 
                role she is playing now and how she is working to reenergize the 
                party that had already gone down the drain, deserves admiration&rdquo; 
                says Kumar. He greatly admires Anand Kumar for establishing the 
                Bihar Super 30, which runs under the banner of Ramanujam School 
                of Mathematics. And finally, Narayan Murthi who was one of the 
                seven founders of Infosys and the CEO of the same for 21 years 
                from 1981 to 2002.<br>
                <br>
                Kumar gives just as much importance to leisure as he does to work. 
                &ldquo;It is very easy to be a workaholic&rdquo; says Kumar, &ldquo;Only 
                then do you realise that life is not just about work but also 
                your family, personal interests and more.&rdquo; He strongly believes 
                in delegation of time and he has himself done so for work and 
                leisure equally. Among his hobbies are watching movies, reading 
                books, socialising, singing and he especially likes travelling. 
                In fact, he likes travelling so much that he doesn&rsquo;t like 
                to repeat destinations, unless he is unable to take his family 
                the first time. Among the list of places that he has travelled 
                to and recommends are Prague, Cappadocia and Shanghai. With such 
                dedication to his job as well as his family and hobbies, it is 
                not in the least bit surprising that he has achieved his dreams.<br>

			<b>Usama Barwani has worked up the ranks in the multinational MB 
			Holding Company, even though it is family owned, and believes that 
			Omani companies have what it takes to become global brands<br>
			</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="person.jpg" width="250" height="308" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">These days everyone is pre-occupied with the global financial crisis 
			and it is but natural that as Director of business development of MB 
			Holding Company, Usama Barwani is engaged in making sure that his 
			company is not caught in the cross currents of this financial 
			tsunami that has mercilessly swept away many corporate giants across 
			the world.<br>
			<br>
			Barwani was not in his office when OER went to meet him, but on 
			returning he explained the reason for being late. He informed us 
			that he had a crises meeting with officials of one of the 
			subsidiaries of MB Holding on ensuring that they are prepared for 
			any eventuality. Barwani immediately comes across as a man who has 
			grace and poise and this is perhaps one of the inherent traits that 
			helps him in his weighty role as a business manager. Not surprising, 
			then he has helped MB Holding in some major multinational 
			acquisitions.<br>
			<br>
			Barwani is deeply involved in two of MB Holding’s Subsidiaries’, 
			United Engineering Services (UES) where he is Managing Director, and 
			Jakarta based MB Century Drilling. The former is a manufacturing and 
			trading company with operations in Oman and Germany, exporting 
			components for the oil industry while the latter is a drilling 
			company with offices in Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia. 
			Barwani revealed that UES’s management have plans to make UES a 
			major force to reckon with in the manufacturing and design by, 
			investing heavily in technology, equipment, and people.<br>
			<br>
			Barwani gives deep credit to the success of the MB companies to the 
			quality of their senior management and employees. He stresses “The 
			secret to building great business is finding the best people to lead 
			subsidiaries and fill key positions, and making sure that they are 
			motivated and empowered to drive business growth”.<br>
			<br>
			He feels that there are enough opportunities for companies who are 
			selective in their investments, even though asset prices have come 
			down, as long as you invest in companies with stable cash flows. 
			Sound thinking. At 28 years of age, one would have expected Barwani 
			to just take life easy and revel in his father’s achievements 
			instead of worrying about the global meltdown. But not him.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Creating MNCs<br>
			</b>Barwani has a mission and a goal, towards which he is striving. 
			As an unabashed believer in globalisation, he has a dream to make MB 
			Holding a truly global brand and that vision motivates him 
			constantly. “If we can have a McDonald in Oman, why can’t we have 
			the presence of an Omani company in all parts of the world?” This is 
			the rhetorical question raised by Barwani. And this comment is 
			well-founded because presently, MB Holding is a multinational 
			corporation with operations and subsidiaries in more than 14 
			countries across the globe besides the Middle East in Europe, North 
			Africa, South East Asia and Asia Pacific.<br>
			<br>
			As the director of business development, Barwani’s main mandate is 
			to constantly scout for new companies and opportunities in order to 
			expand MB Holding’s empire by leveraging its core business strengths 
			and values. He says “We look for companies with good management, 
			that produce synergies and add value to our core business”<br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="person1.jpg" width="190" height="417" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">It was no mean order to reach this present stature as he gained it 
			all through hands on experience by working in several of MB 
			Holding’s group companies and as director in many other companies. 
			After obtaining a degree as a Petroleum Engineer at The University 
			of Tulsa in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Barwani came back to Oman and worked 
			for Daleel Petroleum for two years before going to England for 
			further studies and obtaining an MSc in Finance from City 
			University’s Cass Business School in London. Since then he has been 
			a director in MB Holding.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Business acumen<br>
			</b>Barwani is also the Chairman of Flexible Industrial Packaging 
			Company SAOG (FIPCO) where MB Holding has a controlling stake. Under 
			his stewardship FIPCO has fought hard to achieve a remarkable 
			turnaround. FIPCO is currently implementing plans to expand 
			production, and achieve scale.<br>
			<br>
			Barwani is also a director in Taageer Finance and for the last three 
			years has gained valuable learning experience as this is the 
			youngest, but one of the most dynamic finance companies in the 
			Sultanate of Oman. Barwani is also a director of the newly 
			established Ahli Bank Oman, where MB Holding is the second largest 
			shareholder behind Bahrain’s Ahli United Bank.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Globe-trotter</b><br>
			Traveling around the globe consumes much of Barwani’s time but he 
			indulges in this activity wholesale. His preference is to take the 
			road less traveled and go to the places which are less accessed by 
			the general public. For him, traveling is a pleasurable business as 
			it widens his horizon on many facets of life, not the least being 
			that all people across the world share the same aspirations in life 
			despite racial, religious and cultural differences. While in a new 
			country, Barwani tries to devote as much time as possible to 
			assimilate not only that country’s culture and tradition, but also 
			its corporate culture, the business environment, and laws even while 
			scanning the place as a potential investment ground.<br>
			<br>
			Talking about his leisure activities, Barwani says that he loves 
			boats, especially speedboats like jet-skis, and other outdoor 
			activities. The family, in fact, owns several boats. Call it 
			boat-bonding or whatever, Barwani says that they use these boats for 
			family unions by organising weekend outings for the family, as well 
			as cousins and friends.<br>
			<br>
			“My general feeling is that we need to enjoy our achievements, 
			whether they are big or small. My parents achieved a lot in life and 
			I think my siblings and me need to take things forward from there,” 
			opines Barwani while calling himself basically a people’s person as 
			he likes to spend time with family and friends whenever he gets the 
			time. He also enjoys reading, tennis, scuba diving, camping and 
			outdoor activities. His reading focuses on biographies of great 
			entrepreneurs and achievers, as well as finance and management 
			books. </font></p>

			<img border="0" src="peri.jpg" width="125" height="148" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The Wall Street credit crunch has gone global with a vengeance, 
			leading to a cascade of bank failures, stock market crashes and 
			frozen money markets all over the world. Not even emergency rate 
			cuts by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the ECB, and the 
			Swiss National Bank have stabilised the financial markets. The panic 
			in the stock market and repatriation of funds by American 
			institutional investors has led to a stronger dollar against Asian 
			currencies, even hard money proxies like the Singapore dollar. The 
			fall in the commodities prices has proved catastrophic for markets 
			such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. <br>
			<br>
			The shocking 25 per cent plunge in the Nikkei Dow in a single week 
			is a deflation SOS to the world. Asian markets cannot and will not 
			‘decouple” from Wall Street because the globalisation of finance 
			makes such “decoupling” impossible, as we learnt in the Gulf 
			markets. Not even the US treasury bailout plan or the Ben Bernanke 
			Fed’s rate cuts have unfrozen the money markets, as counterparty 
			risk has now taken on ominous dimensions. Not even a $65 plunge in 
			oil prices boosted traditional Asian oil importers such as Japan, 
			South Korea, Taiwan and India. The multiple shocks on Wall Street 
			have sent Asia into the most traumatic bear market since the 
			collapse of the Silicon Valley tech bubble in 2000. However, Asia is 
			also the growth frontier of the world economy.<br>
			<br>
			<b>No safe havens</b><br>
			It used to be axiomatic to overweight Singapore during bear markets 
			in global equities. But the Straits Times Index (STI) has not 
			exactly proven a safe haven in the meltdown of 2008. The STI has 
			lost half its value from its 3800 peak. Meanwhile, the Singapore 
			dollar has plunged from 1.35 to 1.47 against the greenback. 
			Singapore’s fall from grace can be understood, in retrospect. One, 
			GDP growth has contracted twice in succession, meaning the Singapore 
			economy has gone into a recession. As a small, open economy with the 
			highest export GDP ratio in Pacific Rim, Singapore is vulnerable to 
			any contraction in international trade. <br>
			<br>
			As the Baltic Dry Freight index plunges from 11,000 to 3,000 
			demonstrates, the global economy has flashed a recession SOS that is 
			impossible to ignore. Two, the U-turn in the Singapore dollar proves 
			the focus of the FX traders is now growth risk, not inflation risk. 
			The Singapore dollar was a barometer for bull markets in Southeast 
			Asian equities is no longer one. Three, shipping, aviation, oil and 
			gas and commodities are significant components of the Asian stock 
			indices. It is now evident that the commodities bubble was doomed, 
			hedge fund liquidations would send financial markets in a panic and 
			an economic slowdown hits the emerging markets. <br>
			<br>
			The range for the Straits Times Index for the next year, in my 
			estimate, will be between 1800 and 2400. Singapore is cheap at 12 
			times earnings, far below its 16 times valuation range in the past 
			decade. However, Singapore is still vulnerable to earnings 
			downgrades and an ugly, protracted recession. The Singapore dollar 
			can also fall to 1.50- 1.52 against the USD. It is best only to buy 
			the Amex Singapore ETF (symbol EWS) only when the Straits Times 
			falls to 1800 and earnings season is over. As hedge funds panic and 
			sell, markets go irrational. After all, as Lord Keynes so rightly 
			observed, markets can stay irrational a lot longer than investors 
			can stay insolvent.<br>

			Indonesian shares, historically the high beta market in Southeast 
			Asia, have crashed and the Jakarta Stock Exchange shut down amid 
			fears for the stability of the settlements system and rumours about 
			the listed companies in the Bahrie trading conglomerates. Since it 
			is not uncommon in the emerging markets for conglomerate owners to 
			pledge shares to their bankers for loans, a selling panic can easily 
			become a liquidation panic as banks dump collateral in a falling 
			market. It is ironic that Jakarta shares and the Indonesian rupiah 
			once again relived the nightmares of 1998 (a year of living 
			dangerously for Indonesia, the year Suharto’s military seized power 
			and slaughtered 500,000 alleged communists). Indonesia is the 
			success story of Southeast Asia since President Suharto was elected 
			President in 2004 with a current account surplus, resurrection of 
			the banking system, peace in Aceh and fiscal discipline. However, 
			with crude oil prices in free fall, I do not recommend buying 
			Indonesian shares.<br>
			<br>
			Malaysian politics have been the biggest threat to the Kuala Lumpur 
			stock market ever since the ruling Barisan National Coalition lost 
			five by states (including economically significant Serak and 
			Selangor) to the opposition, led by the charismatic former finance 
			minister Anwar Ibrahim. Of course, prime minister Abdullah Badawi’s 
			decision to hand over power to deputy PM Najib Razak does not remove 
			political uncertainty as UMMO faces its own internal fissures, as 
			does the opposition. In any case, plunges in the international 
			prices of crude oil, natural gas, tin, rubber and palm oil is 
			extremely bearish for Malaysian equities. It is pointless to bottom 
			fish in the KLCI as long as commodities prices are in free fall. 
			However, the fall in the Malaysian ringgit due to the global 
			commodities bear market benefits specific domestic shares. For 
			instance, YTL Power’s UK Wessex subsidiary contributes the majority 
			of earnings and Malaysian Oil Company Wah Seong devices one fourth 
			of its concessions from outside Malaysia. It is also likely that we 
			could see earnings downgrades in Malaysia. While Kuala Lumpur is not 
			expensive at 12 times earnings, there are three major macro forces 
			(politics, falling commodities prices, and earnings downgrades) that 
			could well take the index down to 700, an incredible 50 per cent 
			below its 1400 peak last December.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Shocks on the Indian subcontinent </b><br>
			It is iconic that not even the fall of crude oil below $80 and the 
			Reserve Bank of India’s cash reserve ratio cut did nothing to arrest 
			the downward spiral in the BSE Sensex, which has fallen to 10,500. 
			India was the darling of foreign fund managers during the bull 
			market and the exit of FII’s from the Dalal Street has not being 
			compensated by local buying. Meanwhile, the closure of offshore 
			finance markets means capex (capital expenditure) has slumped and a 
			crash in the over inflated property market is inevitable. India’s 
			excessive twin budget/trade deficits mean risk aversion and 
			political uncertainty hits the Indian rupee even when monetary 
			policy is tight. A general election in 2009 is another source of 
			political risk. <br>
			<br>
			The lessons of 2008 for investors in India are profound. One, 
			valuations matter. Indian shares traded at ridiculously high P/E 
			ratios in 2007, above 20. High valuation markets get slammed when 
			investor sentiment turns bearish. Two, land and share prices cannot 
			rise when the Reserve Bank tightens credit, no matter how compelling 
			the growth story. Three, Indian stock markets cannot rise when 
			foreign hot money flees the Sensex. The exit of $10bn in FII funds 
			led the Sensex to lose 10,000 points since the index peaked at 
			21,000 in January 2008. India now faces an industrial and consumer 
			recession. I would not be surprised if the Sensex drops to 8000 in 
			2009. </font></p>

			<b>Meet Eric McLean, Chief Development Officer, The Zubair 
			Corporation, who believes in living life to the fullest, both at 
			work and after work<br>
			</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="board.jpg" width="200" height="252" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Eric McLean, is a human resources person, who has not only majored 
			in psychology but is also in fact a trained hypnotherapist. You only 
			relax when he discloses that he has not practised hypnotherapy for 
			quite some time now. As Chief Development Officer of The Zubair 
			Corporation, McLean confesses that he is a hardcore workaholic 
			working on a mean 7-7 shift and would not be bothered by a ‘trivial 
			thing’ like taking lunch breaks. “I am one of those persons who eat 
			to live. Even for my dinner, I would be satisfied with popcorn and a 
			nice jug of tomato juice,” he says.<br>
			<br>
			He believes in doing things differently and wants to be the change 
			agent in every aspect of life. He also feels that having come to 
			this country, he needs to contribute something not only for the 
			company, but also for the country, even if it is just a tiny bit. 
			McLean has been instrumental in one of the brilliant human resources 
			development programme undertaken by any corporate in Oman – the GOLD 
			programme – for identifying future managers for The Zubair 
			Corporation.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Love for nature<br>
			<img border="0" src="board1.jpg" width="129" height="160" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"></b>However, his hectic work-schedule does not come in between his 
			passion for scuba diving, which he does off the Al Sawadi coastline. 
			He also has two powerful jet skis in which he zooms away to be among 
			the dolphins every now and then. Yes, McLean loves nature very much. 
			As a diver he encounters many turtles in the Omani waters and in 
			order to see how they look on the land, he visits Ras Al Haad turtle 
			beach often. In two years he has been there nearly five times now.<br>
			<br>
                McLean is a person who wouldn’t have a second thought about holding 
                the door open for even his junior-most subordinate and would be 
                genuinely interested in knowing about your weekend plans. His 
                sense of humour is tremendous which he displayed as he described 
                his own life in the most laughable way. Having lived in the highlands 
                of Scotland, McLean started working at the age of 17. While working, 
                he also found time to continue his studies. He worked for IBM, 
                Altavista, Oracle and other IT companies before he came to Oman.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Creative mindset<br>
			</b>Since childhood, McLean was a creative person and his main aim 
			was to become a journalist and worked hard towards it. But as fate 
			would have it, on the day of the final interview as a reporter for a 
			weekly magazine, he could not find time to read the latest issue of 
			the weekly and when they asked him questions on that, he failed.<br>
			<br>
			McLean throws up many surprises. For example, he won RO100,000 from 
			BankMuscat savings scheme draw within one year of arriving in the 
			country. He also believes that there must be life in another planet 
			and is a gadget freak and has done lot of ‘crazy’ things in life 
			like bungee jumping etc. He has written several books but did not 
			publish even one. He believes in doing good things to people because 
			whatever you do comes back to you. <br>

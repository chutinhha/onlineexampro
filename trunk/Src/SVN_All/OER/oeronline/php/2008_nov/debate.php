						it is their responsibility to take preventive measures 
						so that the financial situation does not worsen. The 
						government is the custodian of a country’s economic 
						environment and so if a need arises it has the right and

						developmental work like health, education etc and invest 
						in infrastructure, which have a long gestation period 
						such as roads, airports, rail where the private sector 
						would hesitate to invest. Government intervention should 
						be indirect to ensure that the economy is running 
						smoothly, by using monetary and fiscal tools to regulate 
						the economy so that businesses can flourish, people live 
						happily and the policies create enough jobs and wealth.<br>

						there are cases coming to light wherein big business and 
						banks have been giving big bonuses and incentives to 
						their senior management and CEOs. The legal system 
						should ensure that this money is re-channelised into 
						helping institutions that need financial support. There 
						is surely a lacuna in the system as we have seen the 
						recurrence of such a crisis in 1929, the 1950s and now. 
						It shows that there is a lack of corporate governance 
						and it raises the need to bring in better regulatory 
						systems to monitor things. The fact that a meltdown in 
						one part of the world has a cascading effect worldwide 
						shows the need for an international body which

						<font face="Verdana" size="1">The current situation is 
						something none of us have ever witnessed, and it can 
						definitely be called “an extraordinary situation” as 
						financial institutions do not trust each other. Banks 
						are not trusting their correspondent banks and even to a 
						large extent small retail depositors have lost their 
						trust on the banks and prefer to keep cash at home 
						rather than banks. This situation is going to have a 
						major impact on all the economies, and this will affect 
						businesses world over. So under the current situation, 
						it is very important that governments must intervene 
						directly or indirectly so that confidence in the 
						financial system can be restored and day-to-day business 
						can go on. Otherwise, this is going to be a disaster for

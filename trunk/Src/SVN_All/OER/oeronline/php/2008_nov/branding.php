			Unit is in the final stages of launching a branding campaign for the 
			Sultanate. As the countdown begins OER catches up with H H Sayyid 
			Faisal bin Turki al Said, CEO, OBMU to get a first-hand account of 
			the developments </b><br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="branding.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Malaysia: Truly Asia, India: Incredible India, Hong Kong: Discover 
			Hong Kong, Oman…, this is set to change from December 2008 as the 
			Sultanate of Oman will have its own distinct brand identity and a 
			message that sums up the essence of the country. Branding a nation 
			is a concept that has been around for a while but it has recently 
			caught the fancy of a number of countries like Finland, India, 
			Montenegro, Greece, Slovenia, Singapore, Malaysia, Croatia, Estonia 
			and Poland.<br>
			<br>
			The government of Oman hired Landor Associates, a consultancy firm, 
			three years back, with the mandate to start a branding process for 
			the country. The firm carried out the spade work for the exercise 
			and based on its recommendations an Oman Brand Management Unit (OBMU) 
			was formed in 2007. Says H H Sayyid Faisal bin Turki al Said, CEO, 
			OBMU, “It was felt that there is a need to have a dedicated entity 
			that takes care of the entire branding process.” The enormity of the 
			task at hand necessitates the need for such a unit. To draw a 
			parallel while a branding message for a consumer product may work 
			for a couple of years, the branding message of a country pans out 
			over 15-20 years as it takes a long time to build up a particular 
			association for a country. The challenge is to figure out what a 
			country wants to achieve and then to mould that into an iconic 
			identity. “The essence of Oman lies in its people, its heritage and 
			culture and that is what we want people to come here and 
			experience,” says Sayyid Faisal. The challenge for OBMU is to 
			present the traditional strength of Oman in a modern idiom.<br>
			<br>
			The one question that OBMU has been working overtime is – How do 
			people perceive Oman? OBMU is expected to answer this query when it 
			formally launches the brand Oman campaign in December 2008. The soft 
			launch will see the unveiling of a national logo and an iconic 
			message that sums up the essence of the nation and a campaign that 
			will carry these across the globe.<br>
			<br>
			To be effective, the core idea behind a brand needs to do various 
			things. It needs to work on an emotional as well as a rational level 
			so that it appeals to people’s hearts and minds. It must be relevant 
			to all of the brand’s stakeholders and be distinctive. Finally, it 
			must be true; it must get to the heart of the brand, avoid clichés, 
			and outline a concept that is recognised as realistic and 
			inspirational by all target audiences.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Four-fold approach</b><br>
			<img border="0" src="branding1.jpg" width="194" height="402" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Based on extensive research the unit has identified four major 
			pillars around which the campaign will play out. These being 
			tourism, inward investment (business and trade), ICT and higher 
			education. Tourism will be the first off the block and the effort is 
			to send out a unified message about the country. This would be like 
			the ‘Essence of Arabia’ campaign. The unit carried out studies in 
			the Middle East, Europe, Asia and North America. Perceptions of Oman 
			were hazy, confused and in some cases negative; Oman was seen as 
			bureaucratic and sleepy.<br>
			<br>
			There were background images of the ancient frankincense trail, 
			hospitable and friendly people, rich heritage, breathtaking scenery, 
			eco-friendly and forward thinking foreign policy. There were of 
			course a variety of national nuances: Britons, Swiss, Emirates, 
			Germans, Indians and other countries each regarded Oman slightly 
			differently. The overall effort will be to package Oman as a modern 
			and vibrant nation which is true to its heritage and culture.<br>
			<br>
			OBMU and Landor have worked out a few key messages that Oman would 
			like to project. For example, the Sultanate would like to highlight 
			the path of natural growth that the country has pursued over the 
			years. “During the past 38 years there has been no sudden shoot ups 
			or dips in growth, rather there has been steady growth,” says Sayyid 
			Faisal. This natural metaphor will also be used to promote the 
			natural beauty of Oman.<br>
			<br>
			Inward investment will promote Oman as a business destination. The 
			effort will be to send out the right messages about the country in a 
			transparent and accountable fashion. The OBMU will also keep an eye 
			out on competitive reports and work on improving the international 
			standing of the Sultanate. Omanis who have excelled in various 
			fields will be used as brand ambassadors and their profiles will be 
			leveraged for branding purposes. Products and services of repute 
			will be highlighted in its campaigns. Says Sayyid Faisal, “The 
			effort is to involve all the stakeholders in the process and create 
			a dynamo effect.”<br>
			<br>
			The OBMU is aware of the need to live up to the promise of the 
			brand. For example, efforts to attract tourists need to be backed up 
			with the requisite infrastructure, similarly investors should get 
			the people with the right skills to take their business forward. 
			OBMU sees 2009 and 2010 as crucial years for the success of the 
			campaign. The unit will carry out regular audit of its initiatives 
			to see whether its message is hitting home or not.<br>
			<br>
			Aware of these challenges, the unit is planning to roll out the 
			campaign in a calibrated fashion. Prior to the launch in December 
			there will be a series of engagement workshops conducted jointly 
			with Landor Associates for all sections of Omani society to 
			disseminate information about the initiative. This will be followed 
			in 2009 with a major education exercise in schools and colleges to 
			engage the youth. “We will go in for a soft launch, educate people 
			and then gradually phase out the programme in its entirety,” says 
			Sayyid Faisal.<br>
			<br>
			<b>The right backing</b><br>
			The OBMU reports to a committee headed by H E Maqbool Ali Sultan, 
			Minister of Commerce and Industry. The committee comprises members 
			from the ministry of tourism, information, commerce and industry, 
			the Royal Oman Police, the Omani Centre for Investment Promotion and 
			Export Development and the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
			This high-level body empowers OBMU to implement its agenda. Its 
			composition also reflects the political will and importance attached 
			by the government towards the exercise.<br>
			<br>
			A stronger recognition is expected to benefit the country in a 
			number of ways. It will increase international trade opportunities 
			and economic growth, enhance Oman’s appeal as a niche tourism 
			destination and help in securing foreign investment. Branding will 
			enhance Oman’s appeal to creative industries and build familiarity 
			with and loyalty to Oman’s unique products and services. Finally, it 
			will establish the Sultanate’s global connections. Sayyid Faisal 
			sums up the need for such an initiative, “I am passionate about it 
			because I strongly believe that it is time for the country to stop 
			working in silos and to give out a unified message” </font></p>

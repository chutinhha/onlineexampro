			</strong><strong>Malcolm Brinded, Executive Director Exploration &amp; 
			Production and a Member of the Board of Royal Dutch Shell, recently 
			touched down in Muscat for the 2008 International Conference on 
			Harnessing Technology where he presented the paper “Meeting energy 
			challenges: the technology imperative”. Here he takes time out of 
			his action-packed schedule to meet with OER’s Jessica Brookes to 
			discuss Shell’s role in Oman and the future of the energy industry.</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>
			<img border="0" src="face.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">What is your view on world demand and supply of 
			energy? </strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			There is no doubt that energy demand in the world is going to go up 
			dramatically and continue to go up. Most estimates are that between 
			now and 2050 energy demand will double as the world’s population 
			grows towards 9 billion, and as the billions of people in the 
			emerging economies go through industrialisation. <br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>Will demand for hydrocarbon decline in the near 
			future as alternative energy sources are developed?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			The demand for hydrocarbons will continue to grow at least for the 
			next 20 to 30 years. The Shell Energy Scenarios (see box: At a 
			glance) both show that oil and gas consumption in 2050 will still be 
			higher than it was in 2000. I think it will grow to say 2030 and 
			then decline. The reason for that is because it will be difficult to 
			develop sufficient alternative supplies of energy to meet demand 
			growth in that time frame. I’m sure alternative energy sources will 
			be developed and fast, but they are starting from such a small base 
			that even if they increase at 10 or 15 per cent a year it will still 
			take a very long time for them to make a significant contribution.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>We see the prices of oil constantly fluctuating, is 
			this pattern likely to continue?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			My view is yes. It is inevitable that this is a sector where you see 
			a volatility of price. That is the only thing I can say about oil 
			price because predicting the level is extremely difficult. What I do 
			think is that some of the drivers for oil prices long term are 
			clear, such as the continued rise in demand. But what can happen in 
			the short term may be very different as periodic surpluses of 
			capacity arise. There are also a lot of influences that are not down 
			to fundamentals, and that also have to be taken into account in any 
			view of the price of oil. There is a lot of market emotion involved 
			and this can lead to prices going up and down quite quickly.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>What is Shell doing to meet the world need for 
			energy?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			We are the biggest explorer in the world and we are the largest 
			investor in new projects amongst any of the integrated oil 
			companies. We also invest very 
			</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400">heavily in research and development – 
			around one and quarter billion dollars a year in R&amp;D – more than any 
			other oil company. The majority of our R&amp;D expenditure is in 
			upstream and goes into understanding how can we find and produce 
			more oil and gas. <br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>
			<img border="0" src="face1.jpg" width="196" height="602" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">What is Shell doing to help Oman oil production?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			Virtually all our efforts are associated with PDO. It is essentially 
			about supporting PDO in the drive to maximise recovery from the 
			existing fields and to find new fields. We have had a very 
			long-standing partnership with Oman, and I am very pleased that the 
			PDO concession agreement has been extended recently for another 40 
			years. The ways in which we help is first of all with people. We 
			have several hundreds Shell expert staff from elsewhere in the world 
			who are working here in PDO at the moment. We try to bring the best 
			ideas and our best research technology here. With joint stewardship 
			we try and work very closely with the Government to understand what 
			the Government’s needs are, and to try and then influence and ensure 
			that PDO discharges its mandate and meets its business plan 
			effectively. Wherever we see a need that we think we can meet we try 
			to do so, with advice, with people, or with ideas.<br>
			<br>
			We have also been very involved in the development of gas. PDO 
			operates the upstream gas in its concession area on behalf of the 
			Government of Oman, and we are privileged to be a joint venture 
			partner as Shell with the Government in the Oman LNG project, which 
			has been an enormous success. In fact, I was working here when we 
			discovered the gas and the decision was made to build an LNG 
			project. I always find it exciting to see how successful that 
			project has been, how quickly it came on stream and how well it has 
			performed since then.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>How much is being invested in enhanced-oil-recovery 
			(EOR)?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			I can’t give you an exact figure. What I can say is that PDO is 
			probably the only company in the world that is simultaneously 
			implementing all three EOR technologies (thermal, miscible-flood, 
			and chemical). All of its major projects, each one of which are 
			multi-billion dollar projects, are essentially EOR. I think that by 
			2015 more than a third of PDO’s oil production will come from EOR. 
			EOR is a very significant part of Shell’s research programme. We 
			have decided to establish an EOR centre in Oman, and to lead our 
			global R&amp;D programme in EOR from the Sultanate.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>How has Shell contributed to Oman’s economic and 
			social needs?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			Our biggest contribution has to be in the success of PDO, which has 
			been responsible for 90 per cent of the growth in oil and gas 
			production in Oman over the last 40 years, as well as in the LNG 
			development. But I am pleased to say we have a separate and distinct 
			Shell social investment program which has been quite successful over 
			recent years. I am particularly proud of the success of ‘Intilaaqah’ 
			and ‘Intilaaqah Enterprise Fund’ which are programmes to help 
			entrepreneurs develop their skills to run new small to medium sized 
			businesses.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>You have lived in Oman before, how does it feel to 
			come back?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			I always love coming back to Oman. The country is so beautiful and 
			the people are always very friendly and welcoming. I am impressed by 
			the pace and scale of the new development that I see. </strong></font></p>

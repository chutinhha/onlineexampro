				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
                    <b>As UAE’s top cable manufacturer, Ducab is ready to meet 
				the ever-growing demand across the region. An OER report<br>
				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="indus.jpg" width="250" height="190" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Ducab, the UAE’s premier cable manufacturer, has been meeting 
				the requirements of discerning clients throughout the Middle 
				East and Far East since it first opened its doors for business 
				in 1979. Although the company’s products are hidden underground 
				and behind walls, they are used in a wide range of demanding 
				scenarios, from low voltage cables for housing cables and street 
				lighting to medium and high voltage for utilities.<br>
				<br>
				A private limited company, jointly owned by Dubai and Abu Dhabi 
				governments in relentless pursuit of quality for both products 
				and services, Ducab has worked for many years to raise quality 
				awareness throughout the UAE.<br>
				<br>
				Ducab’s quality management system was certified to ISO 9001 in 
				1995 and upgraded in 2002 to the more stringent ISO 9001:2000 
				standard. Ducab was the first cable company in the Middle East 
				to achieve this distinction. Ducab is also the only cable 
				manufacturer in the Middle East to obtain product type approval 
				of a range of medium and low voltage cables to British Standards 
				by BASEC (The British Approval Service for Cables).<br>
				<br>
				<b>Growth and expansion<br>
				</b>Ducab witnessed a robust sales growth of over 50 per cent in 
				2007 as compared to the previous year. The company also had the 
				opportunity to partner with some of the key developers and 
				contractors within the GCC region. Last year, the company 
				recorded Dh1.1billion in sales within the first six months and 
				surpassed the year-end target of Dh2.2 billion with a 
				significant margin posting a record-breaking turnover of Dh2.4 
				billion. The two factories in Jebel Ali and Abu Dhabi jointly 
				produced in excess of 125,000 cable tonnes.<br>
				<br>
				Alongside setting new records, Ducab has also gone ahead on an 
				expansion drive that has included the acquisition of new 
				companies which included the buyout of Abu Dhabi’s Electrocab in 
				April this year.<br>
				<br>
				As part of its plans to continually push back boundaries in 
				product excellence and innovation, Ducab has, in February this 
				year, launched a new range of fire resistant cables (FR cables), 
				which are designed especially for high-rise buildings, enabling 
				them to survive longer in the event of a fire. Ducab-FR Cables 
				possess many characteristics which make them extraordinarily 
				effective.<br>
				<br>
				Commenting on the certifications that the new cables have 
				acquired, Ashish Chaturvedi, marketing manager of Ducab, said: 
				“Ducab-FR cables are fully approved to BS7846 by the Loss 
				Prevention Certification Board (LPCB), UK. This approval 
				requires more than testing a sample of cable; as the board not 
				only inspects Ducab’s factories to ensure the stringent levels 
				of quality of the materials and manufacturing process, but also 
				carry out regular audits of cable samples for testing in their 
				UK laboratory. Due to the very strict standards applied by LPCB, 
				very few cable manufacturers get full LPCB approval for their 
				products and Ducab is proud to have this level of approval.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>A UAE first<br>
				</b>Ducab has recently opened a new copper rod facility, the 
				first of its kind in the UAE with an investment of $45mn. The 
				facility itself is designed to take raw copper cathode and 
				convert it into 8mm diameter electrolytic tough pitch (ETP) 
				copper rod as per BS1977:98 (C100) and ASTM B-49:98, which is 
				the required raw material for the production of electric cables. 
				Currently Ducab purchases its copper rod from various suppliers 
				from around the world, but this new facility means that in 
				future Ducab will be self-sufficient in this strategically 
				important raw material. <br>
				<br>
				The facility comprises continuous melting, casting and rolling 
				and is collectively known as the ‘Contirod process’, as 
				developed by the world-renowned heavy engineering group, SMS 
				Meer of Germany. The technology is actually a marriage of German 
				rolling and control engineering with the very latest metal 
				casting technology from a specialist American company called 
				Hazzelet.<br>
				<br>
				The system used in this facility is a world first and gives very 
				precise real time computer control of each of the 15 burners 
				independently, according to Chaturvedi.<br>
				<br>
				The next stage of the process is to cast the molten copper into 
				a continuous cast bar, which can be subsequently rolled into 
				shape. The casting of the copper bar is a critical element in 
				ensuring the quality of the final product. In the case of the 
				Contirod process, a horizontal casting machine is used as 
				supplied by the specialist engineering company Hazzelet. 
				Horizontal casting results in a bar with the best metallurgical 
				structure. In the case of the Ducab machine, various novel 
				features have been incorporated for the very first time to 
				ensure the most efficient thermal transfer of heat from the bar 
				as it cools from molten copper into a solid bar. The result is a 
				cast bar that is more efficient to produce and has the very best 
				metallurgical structure. This is important when it comes to 
				processing the finished rod into quality conductor as required 
				for production of top quality electrical cable.<br>
				<br>
				The next stage of the process is rolling. The rectangular 
				section of the cast copper bar, measuring 50 mm by 60 mm, is 
				rolled in a series of steps down to an 8 mm diameter rod. The 
				computerised rolling process has independent drives on each pair 
				of rollers thereby ensuring the precise control of the rolling 
				process and also to monitor changes caused by wear on the 
				rollers, which can then be compensated for by making fine 
				adjustments to the roll speed.<br>
				<br>
				Logistically this is a very efficient layout; furthermore, it 
				allows Ducab to get immediate feedback regarding the drawing 
				characteristic of the rod, thereby enabling further refinement 
				of the copper rod process conditions.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Meeting expectations</b><br>
				“The UAE is still Ducab’s largest market, although the company 
				is enjoying considerable growth and success all over the GGC, as 
				well as in markets further afield such as Hong Kong,” says 
				Chaturvedi. “Almost every major construction organisation in the 
				UAE is a client of Ducab, and towards the end of May it has 
				entered into a new contract with Arabtec Holding for the supply 
				of cables for all their current projects within the UAE. <br>
				<br>
				“Expansion looks set to continue too, in both the GCC and wider 
				territories such as North Africa, India, Indonesia and all of 
				this is being fuelled by Ducab’s ability to provide a quality 
				product, unbeatable service, and constant availability of 
				supplies,” he says. The company is looking to grow regionally by 
				opening more manufacturing facilities throughout the GCC. 
				Already, within the UAE, the company is installing new plant and 
				equipment in its Abu Dhabi facility that will increase 
				production by 50 per cent. The project is expected to be 
				finished by the end of 2008.<br>
				<br>
				Ducab’s excellence in product quality, technical expertise and 
				cable leadership is evident from the many awards and 
				recognitions conferred on it by the local, regional and 
				international institutions. Dubai Quality Group, RoSPA, ICD 
				Chairman’s award for Best Economic Value Creation and other Gold 
				Awards are to name a few. But the latest feather in its cap is 
				the Emirates Quality Mark Certification awarded recently by the 
				Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology (ESMA). </font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

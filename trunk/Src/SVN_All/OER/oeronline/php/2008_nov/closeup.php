				<img border="0" src="close.jpg" width="125" height="148" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Kuwaiti authorities seem serious about returning to the old 
				practice of developing five-year plans. The last plan dates back 
				to 1986 though interrupted following the Iraqi invasion in 
				August 1990. The authorities hope to commence the plan in April 
				2009 marking start of fiscal year running until March 2014. 
				Kuwait’s fiscal year runs from April to March. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Seven objectives</b><br>
				The trouble is that the plan seems to be too ambitious taking 
				into account the seven broad objectives. These are expanding the 
				value of gross domestic product (GDP); diversifying sources of 
				national income; providing a sufficient room for the private 
				sector to play a leading role in the economy; creating the means 
				to help private sector firms generating job opportunities; 
				boosting technology and research; upgrading bureaucracy and 
				laying a firm foundation for a prosperous society.<br>
				<br>
				Clearly, the scheme envisages private sector firms assuming a 
				primary role in the economy. For its part, the government likes 
				to play a supportive role through provision of an efficient 
				bureaucracy in governmental departments besides putting in place 
				a modern infrastructure. This arrangement should help Kuwait 
				placing its economy on the most logical path, namely that of 
				government being supportive to investors rather than being an 
				investor itself.<br>
				<br>
				To be sure, Kuwait investors tend to be 
				internationally-oriented. Many investors invest abroad in 
				neighbouring Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and 
				beyond. In fact, it is hard finding a new investing financial 
				institution in the GCC that does not have some sort of Kuwaiti 
				stakeholders.<br>
				<br>
				Ostensibly, the challenge rests on Kuwaiti authorities to 
				develop the right infrastructure to encourage local investors 
				investing in the home country. Undoubtedly, this would not be an 
				easy task, as investors have the choice to invest abroad and in 
				fellow GCC states.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Reducing reliance on oil <br>
				<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="112" height="221" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"></b>Now, Kuwait’s treasury is uniquely dependent on the 
				hydrocarbons sector. The sector accounted for 92 per cent of 
				actual budgetary revenues in fiscal year 2007-08. To be sure, 
				fellow Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states of Saudi 
				Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain are less dependent on 
				oil compared to Kuwait. The petroleum industry contributes about 
				80 per cent of Bahrain’s treasury income. Undoubtedly, the 
				extraordinary reliance on the petroleum industry places Kuwait’s 
				economy at the mercy of developments in international oil 
				markets. Clearly, the argument of diversifying the economy away 
				from oil is a logic one.<br>
				<br>
				In addition, the petroleum sector plays a dominant role in other 
				economic areas. Oil exports account for nearly 90 per cent of 
				total exports, making the country vulnerable to external shocks. 
				Likewise, the value of oil activities comprises more than 30 per 
				cent of Kuwait’s GDP. Against this backdrop, it is certainly 
				understandable that the authorities are broadening the economic 
				base across the board. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Economic diversification <br>
				</b>Reducing reliance on the petroleum sector requires speeding 
				up the privatisation programme. The plan includes selling off 
				shares in banks, insurance companies and light industries that 
				the government had purchased through the Kuwait Investment 
				Authority following the collapse of the unofficial stock market 
				in 1982 and the Iraqi invasion in 1990.<br>
				<br>
				Also, the authorities desire to privatise certain activities of 
				Kuwait Petroleum Corp besides the operations of the Kuwait 
				Public Transport Company, which runs buses in the city of 
				Kuwait. Other activities entail postal services and ground 
				communications stations as well as X-ray laboratories and 
				security at public hospitals. Earlier, the authorities succeeded 
				in privatising petrol stations, in turn described as the first 
				real movement on the long path of privatisation.<br>
				<br>
				Still, another benefit of the privatisation drive is to broaden 
				sources of revenue reducing the countries dependence on oil. As 
				mentioned above, the petroleum sector contributes a hefty 90 per 
				cent of total treasury income. Undoubtedly, Kuwait has a long 
				way in order to achieve real diversification away from the oil 
				sector.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="close2.jpg" width="150" height="283" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Regional financial base<br>
				</b>One such primary strategic goal of the proposed five-year 
				plan calls for turning Kuwait into a regional base for financial 
				services. In fact, the authorities are thinking big by virtue of 
				committing a hefty $131bn for the project. The amount covers 
				developing the infrastructure including training the required 
				personnel. <br>
				<br>
				The new move would put Kuwait into direct competition with 
				Dubai, Bahrain, Doha and Riyadh in vying for regional supremacy 
				in financial services. More superficially, the unnamed Kuwaiti 
				financial project would compete head on with Dubai International 
				Financial Centre (DIFC), Bahrain Financial Harbour (BFH), Qatar 
				Financial Centre and the King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) 
				in Riyadh. Work on the mega 1.6mn square metre KAFD commenced in 
				2007.<br>
				<br>
				Upon completion, the district would house all Saudi entities 
				dealing with financial matters including the Capital Market 
				Authority and the Stock Exchange (Tadawal), the commodity market 
				and be the first choice of financial institutions and other 
				service providers such as accountants, auditors, lawyers, 
				analysts, rating agencies, consultants, and IT providers.<br>
				<br>
				In order to become law, the Kuwaiti National Assembly (or Majlis 
				Al-Umma) must approve the five-year plan. Only elected in June, 
				the assembly commenced its meetings in the second half of 
				October. Whether Kuwaiti lawmakers would support the new 
				initiative remains an open question. <br>
				<br>
				However, heated exchanges would most likely take place on a 
				controversial part of the plan, namely making the public sector 
				not the first choice of employment for locals. More than 90 per 
				cent of Kuwaiti nationals work in government departments. 
				Lawmakers would stress for guarantees of the state remaining a 
				primary source of employment of locals. <br>
				<br>
				Kuwait stands out amongst GCC countries by setting aside 10 per 
				cent of annual treasury income to the Reserve Fund for Future 
				Generations. The plan aims at ensuring sustainable means for 
				quality of life for upcoming Kuwaiti nationals. It is all too 
				logical for Kuwait to be distinguished further by putting into 
				effect a viable five-year development plan.<br>
				<br>
				The Kuwaiti resumption of implementing five-year plans would 
				most likely force other GCC countries to revisit existing plans 
				and goals or develop fresh ones. </font>

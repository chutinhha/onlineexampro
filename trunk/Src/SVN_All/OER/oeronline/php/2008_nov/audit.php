				<img border="0" src="audit.jpg" width="125" height="148" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The rapid increase in globalisation, volatile changes in world 
				economies, inflationary trends, rising oil and commodity prices, 
				fluctuation in markets and currencies and uncertainty in the 
				business environment has increased the complexities of the 
				business world leading to a greater focus on internal audit of 
				the business processes and risk management.<br>
				<br>
				Cost rationalisation and optimisation has become one of the key 
				parameters to be monitored and achieved by any business 
				organisation vis-a-vis the competitive advantage, which has led 
				to substantial increase in the scope of internal audit as a 
				monitoring process for internal control systems in almost every 
				sphere of business activity.<br>
				<br>
				The dynamic business scenario has resulted in major changes in 
				the field of internal audit with the involvement of the internal 
				auditor in decision making process, rather than merely doing a 
				post mortem review, thereby adopting a preventive approach as 
				against a corrective one to avoid the impact of any adverse 
				setbacks.<br>
				<br>
				<b>An advisory role</b><br>
				Worldover all large industrial and business groups have 
				established their own internal audit departments and SME’s carry 
				out their internal audit through external professional audit 
				firms/consultants. The management of every professional business 
				organisation has realised the need to have an effective 
				“internal audit department ” as an inbuilt part of their 
				organisation structure in line with their size and business 
				volume, headed by a well qualified and experienced individual at 
				the helm of it, at par with the finance and operations head, 
				with reporting relationships to the board and the chairman.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Importance of internal controls<br>
				</b>Internal controls in any business process are the key 
				drivers to meet the changing competitive nature of any business 
				and unless they are self driven, no amount of audit reports can 
				give the desired results. In normal circumstances any future 
				adverse financial impact can only be known during the post 
				mortem review, after the event has actually occurred. However, 
				if timely actions are taken by the business drivers through the 
				internal audit mechanism at the very inception, the impact of 
				such events could be minimised or altogether avoided.<br>
				<br>
				Business process audit is one of the means of achieving a 
				business turnaround, which many organisations give as an 
				assignment to outside professional consultants. In a number of 
				companies such core areas are becoming a part of the internal 
				audit process, as many of the solutions of a successful 
				turnaround are found within the organisation itself, with a 
				detailed study and review of the organisational structure and 
				activities.<br>
				<br>
				The role of an internal auditor to assist the organisation in 
				identifying, mapping and analysing the key business processes in 
				detail and then suggesting modifications to them, to achieve a 
				turnaround, can hardly be over emphasised. The business process 
				audit approach, instead of focusing on just one or a few 
				processes, provides a more comprehensive view of all the key 
				processes of the organisation and optimises the same to improve 
				the productivity and efficiency.<br>
				<br>
				Focus based management is the key to the success of any 
				organisation, and hence it is extremely important for the 
				management to concentrate on the core areas of revenue and cost 
				in any business to achieve a complete turnaround. Working with a 
				task force approach has been found to be very successful in most 
				organisations, by spreading the scope of internal audit through 
				a team of professionals to assist the management by providing 
				them value added information to meet their goals and navigate 
				them on core issues of business such as product mix formulation, 
				investment analysis, joint venture agreements, commercial 
				contracts, etc.<br>
				<br>
				<b>
				<img border="0" src="audit1.jpg" width="200" height="409" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Risk assessment<br>
				</b>Expansion and growth today is the need of any business to 
				meet the ever increasing race for survival and competition and 
				the management of every organisation has to spend substantial 
				time in the detailed risk assessment of large value proposals/ 
				commitments. The detailed evaluation, analysis and assessment by 
				an internal audit of such proposals has increased significantly 
				as a third party risk assessor.<br>
				<br>
				Today, internal audit in areas such as data storage, data 
				back-up, security and reliability are the most important factors 
				responsible for successful running of the organisation. With the 
				increase of Internet usage and introduction of E-commerce, 
				internal audit of the systems of any company have become very 
				important to ensure that the internal controls and standard 
				processes are followed in the networking and software being 
				used, to avoid any risks associated with the data.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audit as a profession<br>
				</b>With changing times, unlike in the past where the internal 
				auditor was an isolated individual with limited interaction, his 
				position has become more ‘recognised, trusted and valued’ with a 
				user friendly approach, assisting the management in monitoring 
				systems, evaluating risks and implementing policies and 
				procedures in all large professional groups.<br>
				<br>
				The enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act, 2002 has drastically 
				increased the role and responsibility of internal audit, to 
				assist major corporations to effectively develop, document, test 
				and evaluate key controls to meet this new requirement. Further 
				with other major initiatives on the financial horizon such as 
				“International Financial Reporting Standards” and extensive use 
				of ‘business reporting language’ the advisory role of internal 
				audit would continue to climb up in the high profile management 
				corridors where decisions are made.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Internal audit, a global recognition<br>
				</b>Specialisation in the internal audit field has now reached 
				new heights with internationally recognised qualifications and 
				certifications such as CIA, CISA, SOX etc. These are adding new 
				dimensions to the already multifaceted internal audit 
				professionals to meet their ever challenging advisory role and 
				enhanced scope in the current changing business world.<br>
				<br>
				The new role of internal audit is highly sensitive and proactive 
				by being in the field where the action is to get first hand 
				information, through close interaction with the organisation and 
				assisting them during audit reviews. Auditors also keep the 
				board well informed on core issues and policy deviations, by 
				suggesting business solutions and keep business risks well 
				covered.<br>
				<br>
				World over, it is being increasingly felt that the profession of 
				internal audit has become extremely challenging adding 
				substantial value to an individual’s experience in almost every 
				area of business management, leading to better opportunities for 
				taking up a larger role and responsibility by individuals. <br>

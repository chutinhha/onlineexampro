				<font face="Verdana" size="1">The Ferrari California made its official debut at the Paris Auto 
				Show 2008 after a series of special previews on the web and 
				after two dedicated events staged in Maranello and Los Angeles. 
				Ferrari cars have conventionally had the reputation of being 
				sleek but impractical.<br>
				<br>
				Ferrari claims that the California unlike most supercars can be 
				used every day. To make it driver-friendly, the Maranello 
				factory has fitted a clever automatic gearbox, put a V8 engine 
				at the front instead of in the middle – where it normally sits – 
				and added a metal folding roof. The result is a car that looks 
				and sounds Italian but behaves like a well-mannered German. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Reinventing the wheel<br>
				</b>The Ferrari California is an exceptionally innovative car 
				whose philosophy takes its inspiration from the spirit and 
				emotions of one of the great Ferraris of the past, the 1957 250 
				California, a superbly elegant open top car designed for the 
				track, which has over the years come to symbolise not only 
				superior sportiness and performance but also exclusivity, 
				craftsmanship and faultless sophistication.<br>
				<br>
				This new car joins Ferrari’s 8-cylinder range which is made up 
				mostly of very high performance models. It also flanks the 
				12-cylinder flagship 612 Scaglietti in the Grand Tourer 
				category. The Ferrari California is a car with the track in its 
				DNA. It is innovative and will more than fulfill the 
				expectations of even the most discerning customers with its 
				driving pleasure and versatility. The California is available 
				exclusively as a convertible with retractable folding hard top 
				in either a two-seater version with a traditional rear bench or 
				in the 2+ version which sees the rear bench equipped with 
				seating for one or two passengers.<br>
				<br>
				In line with Ferrari tradition, this model positively brims with 
				innovative features. In addition to its retractable hard top and 
				the aforementioned original 2+ concept, the new prancing horse 
				car also offers – a new direct injection V8 engine, a 
				seven-speed gearbox with steering wheel-mounted F1-style paddles 
				coupled with a new dual clutch, a new suspension system, the new 
				evolved F1-Trac traction control system and Bemba brakes with 
				CCM (carbon ceramic material) discs as standard. <br>
				<br>
				<b>If looks could kill<br>
				</b>The California’s sleek aerodynamic styling is like the rest 
				of the current Ferrari models, the result of the company’s 
				longstanding collaboration with Pininfarina and offers a host of 
				signature Ferrari styling cues. Viewed from the side, the 
				aerodynamic sweep of the bonnet beautifully contrasts with the 
				compact tail volume and the pulled back cabin. The front 
				continues some of the themes hinted at on the flanks, 
				harmoniously alternating concave and convex volumes.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="autot9.jpg" width="214" height="200" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">This is the first V8 in the history of Ferrari road-cars to be 
				the mid-front mounted. Built entirely from aluminium, it retains 
				the typical Ferrari architecture with a 90 degree angle between 
				the two cylinder banks and a 180 degree angle between the 
				cranks. The new V8 features direct fuel injection and variable 
				timing (on both intake and exhaust) to guarantee superb 
				performance, exceptional handling and fuel consumption and 
				emissions that easily comply with the toughest Euro 5 and Lev2 
				standards. Thanks in part to these solutions, the Ferrari 
				California consumes just 13.1 litres/100kms and has carbon 
				emissions of 305.6g/km. The California’s engine sound was 
				carefully created, keeping in mind one of the great Ferrari 
				signatures. Particular attention was lavished on sound 
				perception in the cabin both with the top up and down to ensure 
				that the trademark thrill is maintained without compromising on 
				occupant acoustic comfort. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Custom built option <br>
				</b>The Carrozzeria Scaglietti Programme allows all Ferrari 
				clients to personalise their car to suit their own tastes and 
				requirements. There are four main areas covered by the programme 
				– racing and track, exteriors and colours, interiors and 
				materials and equipment and travel. The Ferrari California comes 
				with diamond-finish 19” 5-spoke aluminium alloy wheels as 
				standard. However, a further set of diamond-finish 20” forged 
				5-spoke alloy wheel that are 11 kg lighter than those offered as 
				standard, can also be ordered.<br>
				<br>
				The California is available in a choice of 16 different pastel 
				and metallic colours. However clients also have the option of 
				ordering the new Azzurro California shade created especially for 
				the car’s launch. In addition to the usual range of 12 leather 
				colours available to choose from the interior trim too, two new 
				colours have been added – Cioccolato and Iroko. </font></p>

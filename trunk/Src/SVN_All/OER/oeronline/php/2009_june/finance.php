            <img border="0" src="fin.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="346">We 
            read a lot about ‘green shoots’ emerging in the global economy. 
            Would you agree with this assessment?</b><br>
            It is too soon to draw this conclusion. Definitely the green shoots 
            are a positive sign and mirror Bank Sarasin’s optimistic view on the 
            recovery of the local as well as the global economy. For the GCC 
            region, the government stimulus has definitely helped the recovery 
            process but the region is definitely tied to oil prices. While there 
            are glimmers of hope, it is not the end of the financial crisis. 
            There is still a lot to be done in terms of capturing investor 
            confidence. India along with China are economies that definitely are 
            on the road to recovery with valuations becoming attractive and 
            increase in domestic demand. Bank Sarasin had recently published a 
            report on the Indian Equity markets which highlighted the upside 
            potential of these markets. So I would definitely say that there is 
            a ray of hope for the GCC and Indian markets. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What has been the impact of the financial crisis in the GCC 
            region? </b><br>
            In today’s connected world, no region is immune to the happenings in 
            another region. Although the strong fundamentals of the GCC region 
            did offer some immunity it did not prevent the financial crisis from 
            hitting the region. This has however been felt with varied levels of 
            impact in the different GCC countries. The major impact that we have 
            seen is in the change in investor attitudes. We have had some minor 
            corrections in the past. I have been in the region for a long time 
            and we have seen some ups and downs but not such a steep downturn as 
            we are seeing today. In the last few years, most investors in the 
            region have only seen markets go up and started believing that this 
            is the way the markets will always behave. It has been a learning 
            process for everyone. The more I interact with people, the more I 
            feel they are beginning to understand some of the things they 
            shouldn’t have done like overleveraging. It will hurt, that’s for 
            sure and it is with this hurt that the maturity will come in.<br>
            <br>
            As far as private banking is concerned, as I always say, this crisis 
            has brought us back to the basics. In the last few years we have 
            seen that anybody could come, set up operations and make some money. 
            Now the customer wants to understand very clearly why he should 
            trust you with his money. In many ways it is back to basics for the 
            private banking industry – safety and security are of prime 
            importance. That is why banks came up in the first place and there 
            is again a growing recognition of these basics and trust is once 
            again the key word. Customers and potential customers will 
            increasingly want to understand your story and your credibility 
            before they will trust your advice and trust you with their money.
            <br>

            <img border="0" src="fin1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="191" height="254">One 
            of the things that will definitely happen is consolidation. People 
            who had multiple accounts will definitely consolidate, especially if 
            they have got less wealth. We must however not loose sight of the 
            fact that there will be life after the crisis and decisions we take 
            today will impact where we stand after the crisis is over. In every 
            crisis there is an opportunity and there are now emerging some 
            exceptionally attractive investment opportunities in some of the 
            world’s best and strongest companies. We feel that both the 
            financial institutions and the investors will come out wiser from 
            their experiences of the current financial crisis. The current 
            crisis will shape investor attitudes over period of time and we will 
            see more responsible behaviour and an increased focus on “wealth 
            preservation” as opposed to an aggressive focus only on “wealth 
            creation.” <br>
            <br>
            <b>Do you foresee different countries in the GCC region coming out 
            of the crisis in different stages?</b><br>
            The crisis has definitely had a different impact in each of the GCC 
            countries. We look at the Qatar and Oman economies as being able to 
            with stand the impact of the crisis and come out of it without 
            requiring fresh stimulus. The UAE government has taken several 
            measures to ensure that enough money is injected into the economy to 
            ensure a smooth recovery. According to our economists, the Gulf 
            States particularly Oman will emerge as powerful economies driven by 
            the wealth it contributes not just in terms of natural resources but 
            also human capital and business infrastructure. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Can companies expect the liquidity situation to improve in the 
            near future or are banks still reticent to lend?</b><br>
            There has been a gap of liquidity in recent months as banks are 
            trying to balance their books but this is not the case any longer. 
            There is a big pool of liquidity selectively available in the 
            region. The infusion of funds by the Central Banks and the 
            announcement of the Central Bank of UAE and other Central Banks of 
            guaranteeing local deposits is also contributing to improving the 
            liquidity in the market. With the economic downturn, banks became 
            wary of lending and brought about a temporary credit squeeze. 
            However, with the improvement in liquidity and pressure of the 
            Central Banks, availability of liquidity to the corporate world has 
            improved. As far as banks are concerned, they are now willing to 
            lend depending on the quality of the borrower and the risk profile. 
            This should have been assessed carefully some time ago but this 
            process is definitely in place now. However, availability of credit 
            to the real estate or other speculative businesses is still 
            restricted.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Can you give us a brief background of Sarasin-Alpen in the 
            region?</b><br>
            Bank Sarasin-Alpen was established in the Dubai International 
            Financial Centre in 2005 and is a subsidiary of Bank Sarasin &amp; Co, 
            Switzerland. The Sarasin Group’s majority shareholder is Rabobank 
            which enjoys the highest credit rating of ‘AAA’ from Standard &amp; 
            Poor’s and Moody’s, since 1981. Bank Sarasin-Alpen, Dubai the first 
            subsidiary of Bank Sarasin in the region started operating as a 
            relatively unknown brand and in the last five years has come to 
            establish itself as a boutique private bank offering tailor-made 
            solutions for clients. <br>
            <br>
            It was awarded the “Best Private Bank” Award by Banker Middle East 
            Industry Awards for two consecutive years – 2007 and 2008. In 2008, 
            it also expanded its business to Qatar and Oman where it is 
            incorporated as Bank Sarasin Alpen (Qatar) Limited and Sarasin Alpen, 
            Oman respectively. In Oman, we operate as an organisation providing 
            private banking advisory solutions and we are proud to be one of the 
            first private banking advisory solutions providers in the country of 
            Swiss origin. In addition, we also launched an asset management 
            company in Dubai called Sarasin-Alpen &amp; Partners limited in 2008. 
            The company launched its first fund, the GCC Equity Opportunities 
            Fund (USD) in January 2009.<br>
            <br>
            We see Oman as having a great potential and our expansion to this 
            market significantly supports our growth initiatives in the GCC. We 
            have a unique business model wherein the private banking activities 
            of Bank Sarasin-Alpen are complemented by our Investment Banking 
            arm, Alpen Capital. Alpen Capital provides advisory solutions in the 
            areas of debt &amp; equity capital markets, syndications, M&amp;A advisory, 
            corporate restructuring and private equity to institutional and 
            corporate clients in the GCC and South Asia. The same model is 
            followed in all our locations. <br>

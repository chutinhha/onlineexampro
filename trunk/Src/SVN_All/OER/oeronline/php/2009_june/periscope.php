            is now self evident to even the most diehard equity bull that 
            investors, since they cannot foretell, the future, must diversify 
            their portfolios among diverse asset classes. After all, in the past 
            decade, the ten-year US Treasury bond and even the humble GCC banks 
            cash deposit has grossly outperformed the SP500 index. Bonds are a 
            natural hedge against systematic financial risk and a stock market 
            freefall, as the world learnt during the successive Wall Street 
            panics of 2008. This business cycle is unlike anything the world has 
            seen since the 1980’s. More than six million Americans are 
            unemployed and the jobless rate is 8.5 per cent. Some of US and 
            Britain’s mightiest banks are on government life support. Credit 
            risk is priced higher than at anytime since the Great Depression. 
            The Fed’s inflation phobia in summer 2008 (when oil hit $147) has 
            turned to deflation hysteria. <br>
            <br>
            Central banks have scrambled to slash short term borrowing rates to 
            near zero in the US, Canada, Britain, Japan and Switzerland. 
            However, the fiscal and monetary response to the credit crisis in 
            the US has been monumental, with a $2 trn budget deficit and a 
            Federal Reserve that has doubled the size of its balance sheet. The 
            Fed’s role as the lender, issuer and guarantor of the last resort to 
            the banking system and the seismic changes in the landscape of Wall 
            Street investment banking have changed the rules of the game in the 
            bond market. The brave new world of the debt investing offers both 
            exceptional opportunities and very real risks.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Best case scenario</b><br>
            Conventional wisdom suggests that investing in bonds amid a period 
            of epic central banks money printing is the height of folly. 
            However, it is impossible to envisage the runaway inflation of the 
            1970’s (the kiss of debt for world debt markets) any time in the 
            near future as long as the US economy remains fragile and sluggish 
            bank credit growth dampens the money multiplier. Inflation will 
            trend lower, the US economy will not deliver positive GDP growth 
            until next spring and the Federal Reserve will do its best to buy 
            long dated US Treasury bonds (classic quant easing, as spelled out 
            in the March, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)) whenever the 
            yield on the bellwether 10-year note crosses 3.20 per cent. I still 
            believe the yields of Uncle Sam’s IOU (debt) will drift lower in the 
            months ahead and must remain a nervous long in the US Treasury bond 
            market. <br>
            <br>
            The German bond market, I feel, offers far better value at a time 
            when the export economy has tanked and Berlin forecasts a shocking 
            six per cent GDP plunge in 2009. The European Central Bank (ECB), in 
            any case, will reduce its refinance rate even below one percent, a 
            tacit admission of quant easing and the purchase of German 
            government debt by Jean-Claude Trichet’s (President of ECB) gnomes 
            is no longer unthinkable. In any case, quant easing suggests that 
            volatility in the interest rate markets will fall and yield curves 
            will flatten, with the two- ten US Treasury yield curve flattening 
            from the current 240 to as low as 150 basis points. Despite their 
            1.4 percent yield, Japanese government bonds are not expensive, 
            though I doubt if there is any real return upside in Asia’s stricken 
            export tiger.<br>
            <br>
            Cash will be a loser’s game, unless investors are tempted by the 
            high credit risk bank deposit returns offered by Gulf banks. The 
            FOMC cannot and will not tighten monetary policy for at least the 
            next eight months as long as the monthly jobless rate keeps rising, 
            house prices do not bottom and the uncertainty over stress tests on 
            US banks capital is unresolved. Therefore, it is all too likely that 
            the Fed Funds rate will remain in its current 0-25 basis point range 
            until at least summer 2010. The Bundesbank’s Weimar Republic 
            obsessions will restrain any move to unconventional easing by the 
            ECB, though it is entirely possible that the next cut in the repo 
            rate will not be the last. Cash returns in the US and Eurozone money 
            markets will be a derisory 1- 1.5 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Value buys</b><br>
            The US corporate debt market offers 
            exceptional value at current levels, despite sluggish profits, 
            downgrade risks and mark to market woes amid global recession. 
            However, I believe that the risk rally in speculative high yield 
            junk bonds has been overdone and investors should rotate into the 
            quality, investment grade segment of the corporate bond market, 
            ideally AA blue chips. British industrial corporates will clearly 
            benefit from Governor King’s determination to revive economic growth 
            via direct Bank of England purchases of British corporate debt. 
            Sure, credit downgrades will widen credit spreads, financials still 
            face a credit Black Death in their loan books and default risk is 
            far too high in UK or European leveraged loan or high yield debt 
            markets. <br>
            <br>
            It is therefore best to remain invested in high grade investment 
            debt in both the US and Europe. In the Gulf, I believe Mubadala’s 
            ten year dollar bonds offer deep value at eight per cent for a AA 
            rated Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund whose business model clearly 
            positions it as the Gulf’s Temasek. Abu Dhabi Government bonds were 
            a winner as spreads tightened by 100 basis points and I would not be 
            surprised to see Mubadala five– ten year note yields compress as 
            regional banks and insurance companies scramble to buy Abu Dhabi 
            sovereign risk at spreads more normally associated with bank loans 
            in the Gulf.</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">I believe it makes no sense to overweight commodity linked debt at 
            current levels. Oil prices can fall below $45 as US inventories are 
            the highest since the 1990’s, the swine flu scare will prove a 
            disaster for the jet fuel market and Saudi Arabia does not succeed 
            in boosting compliance from quota overproducers like Iran, 
            Venezuela, Angola and Nigeria in OPEC. IMF gold selling and 
            reduction in systematic risk can dampen gold prices to $800. Copper 
            is an accident waiting to happen as Chinese do not add reserves at 
            $4200 per tonne London Metal Exchange (LME) prices. This is not 
            bullish for the debt of Big Oil, Freeport Mc Moran or Newport 
            Mining. While the markets are now optimistic about risk, the 
            realities of the world economy still do not justify unbridled 
            optimism. It is still prudent to invest in government debt on any 
            dip.</font></p>

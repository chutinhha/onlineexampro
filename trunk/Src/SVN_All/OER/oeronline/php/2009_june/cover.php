            Walk into any office in Oman and chances are that you will notice 
            recyclable paper baskets, coloured bins, posters, notices and saving 
            of energy in some form or another. And these are not just platitudes 
            but being increasingly abided by managers and executives religiously 
            across sectors. Oman LNG, Muriya Tourism Development, Petroleum 
            Development Oman (PDO), Shangri-La's Barr al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa, 
            Grand Hyatt, Majan College, Shell Development Oman are amongst a 
            growing list of companies which use some sort of an internal office 
            setup to help promote the ‘green’ cause.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover3.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="194" height="246">And then there are others who are taking such initiatives far beyond 
            the confines of their office. One such company is Towell Auto Centre 
            (Tac) and their TAC Ecodrive campaign. It was amongst the first 
            corporates who took up the cause way back in 2007, but was hindered 
            greatly by Cyclone Gonu, only to come back in full force as a 
            corporate campaign in 2008. The campaign was spawned from the 
            ideology that both S. Kasthurirengan, CEO – TAC, and Annurag Chawla, 
            Head of marketing &amp; communications – TAC, shared. “It is not just a 
            campaign that we do on special occasions. It is an ideology and a 
            part of our corporate culture”, says Chawla. The campaign is simple 
            enough – spread awareness among the community and drive them towards 
            saving the four key elements of daily life – water, energy, the 
            environment and fuel. The campaign began right at home. TAC started 
            with their own staff, and then spread the awareness to the community 
            at large. The campaign made further inroads with the inclusion of 
            school children through interactive presentations and by taking the 
            message to other corporates of Oman and their key stakeholders. It 
            has therefore become an attitude and a purposeful way of life.</font></p>

            <img border="0" src="cover5.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="307" height="335"><b>Knowing your footprint</b><br>
            With over 40 per cent of the world’s oil resources being located in 
            the region, fuel based companies have a bigger responsibility to 
            reducing carbon footprint. So what is a carbon footprint (CF)? The 
            burning of fossil fuels leads to an increase in the level of carbon 
            dioxide in the atmosphere, thus enhancing the greenhouse effect 
            above the permissible norm. This in combination with the rise in 
            methane, nitrous oxides and CFC’s endanger the environment further. 
            This is where the carbon footprint comes in. It is basically the 
            amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual, 
            organisation, event or product. And knowing how to reduce your 
            footprint, no matter how large or small, is the best contribution 
            you can make to the environment.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover6.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="307" height="334">Hydrocarbon-based industries have the unenviable distinction of 
            creating the largest CFs amongst its peers, led by coal used in the 
            power generation sector and followed by transportation fuels. Gas, 
            the most benign of the hydrocarbons creates a CF less than half that 
            of coal. Aware of these facts many fuel companies across the globe 
            are working hard on reducing their CFs. The buzzwords here are ‘act 
            responsibly’. Dr. Brian Denis Buckley, General Manager and Chief 
            Executive, Oman LNG, puts it perfectly: “Our responsibility towards 
            the environment comes in at various levels – individual, corporate, 
            industry-wide and global.” “For example, as individuals and as 
            companies we are careful to be efficient with energy and minimise 
            our waste through the reduction, reuse and recycle of the materials 
            we use. In Oman LNG, our use of gas-powered turbines, which are the 
            most efficient form of energy extraction available today, maximises 
            energy efficiency. Gas turbines also create the lowest CF per unit 
            of energy of all the fossil fuels. We take care to minimise waste – 
            and set annual targets for continuous reduction. We take steps to 
            ensure, for example, that the sea water, used for cooling in our 
            plant, does not come in contact with any process material and is 
            returned to the sea uncontaminated and with minimum increase on its 
            original temperature to protect its ecosystem. Through design and 
            operations and maintenance practices, we minimise our carbon 
            footprint at a level that is pacesetting in the industry”, says 
            Buckley. &quot;Finally, at the industry-wide and global levels we work to 
            continuously improve standards throughout our industry and to 
            collaborate with governments in achieving levels of performance that 
            will protect and conserve our environment whilst achieving economic 
            growth and wellbeing”, concluded Buckley. <br>

            <img border="0" src="cover8.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="292" height="290">PDO on its part is committed to finding environmentally-friendly 
            solutions to its strategic investments. The oil and gas major 
            recognises that what makes good environmental sense also makes good 
            business sense. In the barren desert of Nimr in South Oman, dust and 
            sand will soon give way to a green oasis. Taking its cue from the 
            ancient Egyptians who used natural reed beds to clean up dirty 
            water, PDO is using the age-old principle to remove oil from water 
            produced alongside oil production. Such water is currently 
            re-injected into deep reservoirs where it can be safely stored 
            without affecting groundwater, a process known as deep water 
            disposal. After a successful eight-year experiment, the Nimr reed 
            bed project is set to treat 45,000 cubic metres per day of water 
            from local oilfields. PDO will create a giant farm with 240 hectares 
            (2.4 mn square metres) of reed beds which will become operational in 
            early 2011. “Our trials demonstrated that reed beds are a 
            technically viable alternative to deep water disposal,” explains Khalifa al Harthy, Head of Environment, PDO. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover9.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="196" height="254">South Oman is the site of another technological step forward aimed 
            at limiting the carbon footprint of PDO’s operations. At Thayfut, 
            PDO is embarking on its first solar energy project. Approval was 
            recently obtained for a pilot project known as “Thayfut solar steam 
            generation pilot”. Under the project, PDO will install parabolic 
            troughs which will be used to generate steam for injection into 
            underground reservoirs. Parabolic troughs work by concentrating the 
            sun’s rays onto receiver tubes carrying water which under the 
            intense heat then turns into steam. If successful, the project could 
            lead to change in the way PDO generates energy for its thermal 
            enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. Royal Dutch Shell, a global 
            leader in the industry, is working on a number of initiatives 
            globally to combat the problem. “Shell is an energy company in a 
            world governed by three hard truths,” says Dr. Andrew Wood, Shell 
            Country Chairman, Shell Development Oman. What are these hard 
            truths? Firstly, global demand for energy is growing, and this will 
            mean increased demand for oil and gas. Secondly, supplies of “easy 
            oil” (easily accessible, conventional oil and gas) cannot keep up 
            with the growth in demand. As a result, society has no choice but to 
            add other sources, such as renewable and “unconventional” fossil 
            fuels, to its repertoire. And lastly, more energy means more CO2 
            emitted in a time when climate change looms as a critical global 
            issue.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover10.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="192" height="512">These “hard truths” can only be combated through the joint effort of 
            governments, industry and the consumers. It all boils down to the 
            task of balancing the accessibility, affordability and acceptability 
            of energy, in turn influencing its economic viability. Many of these 
            methods such as taxes on cars dependent on engine sizes, taxes on 
            disposal of waste, higher energy prices and the like are well known. 
            An interesting method of reducing emissions called Carbon Cap and 
            Trade is being tried out by a few developed countries. This involves 
            setting of a carbon emission standard within a government’s 
            jurisdiction and distributing it evenly among the different 
            industries and then allowing it to become a tradable commodity. What 
            this does is allow “greener” companies an additional means of profit 
            to promote their cause and while at the same time giving the other 
            companies the leverage they need to meet their emission limits, 
            albeit at a higher cost. But this system also has an additional 
            benefit; it allows the government to study the concentration of 
            emissions within the various industries. Royal Dutch Shell for its 
            part is actively pursuing the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) 
            method to reduce carbon emissions. CCS is a process whereby CO2 is 
            captured from industrial or energy sources and then transported to a 
            storage site to be injected into geological formations deep 
            underground, where it can be permanently trapped. Says Wood,&quot;There 
            are potentially three types of locations that are suitable for such 
            disposal. Firstly, there are deep saline aquifers which have large 
            storage potential but require detailed research into the geological 
            characteristics. Then there are already depleted gas fields, but 
            these typically have uncertainties concerning the integrity of 
            abandoned wells. And lastly there are mature oil fields. These can 
            provide a “win-win” situation, so to speak, in fields where there is 
            Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) potential as this can reduce the funding 
            required to create a CCS infrastructure.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover12.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="330" height="323">A number of ‘green’ initiatives being taken by companies in Oman go 
            beyond the purview of a company’s social responsibilities. A fine 
            case in point is Land Rover. As David Aziz, Director Automotive 
            Products, MHD puts it, “As part of the ongoing commitment to address 
            the challenges of the environment, Land Rover is actually the first 
            car manufacturer to launch its own CO2 offset program.”All vehicles 
            sold in the Gulf will include the CO2 offset package, which is based 
            on offsetting an equivalent of 72,000km worth of CO2 emitted by a 
            vehicle. This CO2 offsetting funds projects that avoid or reduce CO2 
            emissions so that the amount saved balances the original emissions. 
            In addition, Land Rover, as part of the Our Planet programme, 
            sponsors a number of different organisations such as Born Free 
            Foundation, the Biosphere Expeditions, Earthwatch Institute, Royal 
            Geographical Society and the China Exploration and Research Society.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover13.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="193" height="254">Coming back to emissions, when it comes to CF levels, at a corporate 
            or industrial scale, things really start to ‘heat up’. A number of 
            companies in Oman like Oman LNG, Grand Haytt have got an ISO14001 
            certification, embellishing their environment friendly credentials. 
            ISO14001 (International Standard for Organisation) is a set of 
            environmentally friendly and cost efficient practices. This 
            certification includes using energy-saving light bulbs and 
            biodegradable cleaning materials, water restrictors and sewage 
            treatment facilities to prevent water pollution. Another interesting 
            campaign that most of us are familiar with is the anti-plastic 
            campaign. Backed by the ESO (Environment Society of Oman) it is 
            followed by quite a few companies, either in collaboration with the 
            ESO or on their own. The primary objective of this campaign is to 
            reduce the use of plastics where not needed and to use reusable bags 
            instead. The Grand Hyatt Muscat took this cause one step further by 
            converting all clean but damaged old bed-linen into reusable bags, 
            at their own cost, and gave them away to their staff to promote the 
            anti-plastic cause.</font></p>

            <b>Developing the future</b><br>
            Dr. Reginald Victor, Director and Professor, Centre of Environmental 
            Studies and Research, Sultan Qaboos University, says: “Oman is 
            considered as the leader in environmental conservation and research 
            in the region. But now that scenario is changing slightly because of 
            the rapid development.” Take a closer look and you will find that 
            there is quite a bit a development going on, especially along the 
            coast and it is inevitable that this will affect the environment. 
            So, the question that we have to ask ourselves is – where do we 
            bridge the gap between developing our livelihood and protecting the 
            environment? The answer lies in something called ‘Sustainable 
            Development’. The easiest way to describe it is ‘utilising the 
            resources of today without compromising its use for the generations 
            to come’. To do so, requires intense amounts of research and 
            analysis and while the damage cannot totally be avoided it can 
            definitely be reduced.<br>
            <br>
            Muriya is just such a company. They are at present developing two 
            major projects; the Salalah Beach project which is spread over 15.6 
            million square metres and 8.2km of beachfront; and the Jebel Sifah 
            project which spreads over 6.2 million square metres and 5.6km of 
            beach front. One of the key features of the two projects is the 
            inland marinas. In doing so Muriya avoids reclaiming land from the 
            sea, which is extremely harmful to the marine environment. “By 
            reclaiming land from the sea, you disturb the shoreline and this has 
            major implications on the environment. You have accretion of sand on 
            both sides of the shoreline, disturb the currents, disturb the 
            marine life and kill the coral”, says Cyril Piaia, CEO, Muriya 
            Tourism Development. He also added, “By building inland marinas we 
            don’t disturb the natural flow of the water, natural currents and 
            the marine life.” Also part of the plan is the proper disposal of 
            brine from the desalination plants and the use of off-shore mooring 
            buoys. Also, only local flora will be used for the projects. But, 
            with increased tourism comes the need for hotels, which also have 
            quite a significantly large carbon footprint. Reducing this is no 
            easy task and requires some firm protocols and ingenuity. For 
            instance, Grand Hyatt Muscat, whenever possible, closes down one 
            wing of the hotel to reduce power consumption. They are in plans to 
            use AC condensation water for the plants in the hotel. “You usually 
            have huge AC plants in a hotel such as this. The condensation water 
            is several thousand litres. So, just using that will make a 
            difference”, says Christoph K. Franzen, GM, Grand Hyatt Muscat. They 
            are also in the process of completely phasing out the use of plastic 
            bottles in the hotel, controlling the use of paper and also use 
            various methods, such as motion sensors and energy saving bulbs, to 
            further reduce energy consumption in the hotel. Even Shangri-La’s 
            Barr Al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa spares no expense when it comes to 
            environment conservation. “All Shangri-La properties follow an 
            Environmental Management System Manual, which helps to identify and 
            address the immediate and long-term impact of the hotel’s operations 
            on its local environment”, says Arbind K. Shrestha, GM, Barr Al 
            Jissah. The resort also has a sewage treatment facility. All water 
            is clarified and treated and in turn used to maintain the resort’s 
            extensive landscaped and natural surroundings. The resort also takes 
            great pride in its turtle beach and puts great effort in maintaining 
            it. The beaches remain unlit at night and the exterior lights are 
            soft, not to put off turtles. There is a dedicated Turtle ranger on 
            staff who makes sure turtles are treated in a right way, and that 
            their habitat is not disturbed by guests or staffs. The nesting is 
            marked with wooden stands and a sign to alert everyone that a turtle 
            nesting is located below. </font></p>

            <b>The exotic problem</b><br>
            Unfortunately, with increased development comes an additional danger 
            that not many are aware of – the introduction of foreign exotic 
            species of plants and animals into the local ecosystem. The most 
            important fact to consider is that when a species of plant and 
            animal is absent in a certain area, there is a good reason for it. 
            If you try to plant a species that was not initially there, you are 
            basically interfering with the natural order of things and in 
            actuality you are doing a lot more harm than good. And in fact it 
            even goes far deeper than that. Taking any green golf course in the 
            world as an example, by building the said course one provides ample 
            amounts of food and shelter for creatures that were initially 
            struggling for food and survival. This causes those creatures to 
            thrive and eventually turn, what were once rare, into pests that 
            also affect the other flora and fauna in the area! And no matter 
            what sort of environmentally friendly methods are used in the 
            process, this sort of damage cannot be avoided. <br>
            <br>
            </font>
            <img border="0" src="cover21.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="253" height="266"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This sort of damage gets even worse when circumstances or industries 
            involve the introduction of new species of plants and animals into 
            the environment. Take for example, the pet industry; it involves the 
            introduction of foreign animals into an environment that was not 
            initially meant for them. When left free, these new species of 
            animals may flourish and, in nearly all cases, will compete with and 
            eventually drive off the local fauna thereby affecting the entire 
            local ecosystem. Prime examples of such competition are the green, 
            Rose-ringed parakeets and House crows. These were creatures that 
            were introduced by accident and are now thriving in an environment 
            that they were never meant to be in. And even worse, or what may 
            even seem heartless, is the solution to such damage – get rid of the 
            said exotic creature. While this may seem cruel, it is a matter of 
            choosing the lesser of two evils. On one side we have the parakeets 
            or crows who for no fault of their own have survived in the wild and 
            have managed to compete successfully for food and shelter but on the 
            other hand we have the local birds who were originally of this 
            ecosystem and who now have a new, and extremely strong, competitor 
            for the same resources. But these birds, being much smaller as they 
            are, don’t stand a chance and run the risk of being extinct. The 
            choice, as you can see, is not in their hands but in ours. This is a 
            choice that we would not have had to be made had the right steps 
            been taken right in the beginning but what we can do with ease is 
            avoid this from ever happening again. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Education is the key</b><br>
            The children of today hold the keys to the world’s future. It is our 
            responsibility to educate them in the right way and make them aware 
            of the importance of conservation. It is good to see that schools 
            and colleges are making a genuine effort in this regard. “The 
            potential is there and it thrills me to know that the students have 
            so many ideas. But they sometimes need a certain competition or 
            movement to explore and reflect on those potential ideas”, Says 
            Mohamed Murtadha Al-Eisa, Marketing and PR manager, Majan College. 
            One such initiative is Majan College’s “Majan friends of the 
            Environment”. The objective of this initiative is put forward a 
            message and to educate others about the importance of conservation 
            and the methods that need to be utilised. Whatever said and done, 
            these burden is not theirs to bear alone. It is only with support 
            from larger corporations and organisations can they hope to be a 
            success. This responsibility should also be taken up on a personal 
            level by educating children to take it forward as a way of life. 
            Remember, educate the young of today for a better world of tomorrow.

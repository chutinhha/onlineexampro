            India, and one immediately conjures up a picture of an enigmatic 
            land teeming with a billion people. This subcontinent country, which 
            has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies of the world, 
            also offers myriad exciting experiences to international travellers.
            <br>
            <br>
            The growth trend in foreign tourist arrivals to India is quite 
            amazing to say the least. According to the latest statistics 
            released by the government of India, despite the ongoing global 
            financial meltdown, foreign tourist arrivals during March 2009 
            alone, were 4,72,000 and during the first quarter of 2009, the 
            figure stood at 1.46 million. In terms of foreign exchange earnings 
            from tourism, again in March 2009 alone, the figure stood at $867mn 
            with the figure in the Q1 2009 standing at $2.73bn. Despite short 
            and medium term setbacks like the Mumbai terror attacks, tourism 
            revenues are expected to rise by 42 per cent from 2007 to 2017.<br>

            <img border="0" src="tourism1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="258">To 
            keep up the impetus of the travel industry and encourage more 
            travellers, the Indian Union Ministry of Tourism has launched a 
            ‘Visit India 2009’ campaign by offering attractive incentives to 
            foreign tourists visiting the country during the period April 
            2009-March 2010. The value additions that would be offered include 
            one complimentary international air passage for travelling 
            companion, one night complimentary stay in the hotel booked by the 
            tourist, complimentary local sightseeing tour in any one city of 
            visit and a complimentary rural eco-holiday in the country. 
            Likewise, foreign medical tourists will also be offered one 
            additional treatment free of cost at leading healthcare centres like 
            Apollo Hospitals, Manipal, Moolchand, Fortis and Wockhardt.<br>

            <b>Roadshow</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="tourism2.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="199">Anil Wadhwa, Indian Ambassador to the Sultanate, launched the 
            ‘Incredible India’ road show and an outdoor advertising campaign at 
            a function held at Muscat InterContinental Hotel last month This was 
            part of the roadshow for Visit India 2009 promotional campaign. HE 
            Wadhwa flagged off the bus wrapped in Incredible India images as 
            part of ‘Visit India 2009’. The road show was held under the aegis 
            of India Tourism Office Overseas, in collaboration with the Indian 
            Association of Tour Operators (IATO) and Embassy of India in Oman.<br>
            <br>
            The roadshow attracted around 100 delegates from Oman’s travel and 
            trade industry who were able to have fruitful B2B talks with their 
            counterparts from India. Quoting a tourism report, HE Wadhwa said 
            that the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2009 brought out 
            by the World Economic Forum, ranked India in the 11th position in 
            the Asia Pacific region and 62nd overall in a list of 133 assessed 
            countries in 2008 as a tourist destination. This has taken India up 
            by three places since 2007. <br>
            <br>
            The report observes that India is richly endowed with natural and 
            cultural resources, with several World Heritage sites and boasts of 
            a rich bouquet of tourism services, ranging from leisure tourism in 
            verdant hill stations to houseboats in Dal Lake of Kashmir and the 
            backwaters of Kerala. India also has beach tourism in several exotic 
            places dotting the country’s vast coastline; while its medical 
            tourism in world class super-specialty hospitals is world class.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Full-fledged campaign</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="tourism3.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="273">According to M Sadana, regional director, (East Asia, West Asia and 
            Africa), India Tourism, Dubai, despite the global recession, Indian 
            tourism market was very buoyant and grew by 6 per cent in 2008. 
            Therefore, the ministry of tourism has decided to continue with its 
            promotional activities and Visit India 2009 roadshow is part of this 
            campaign. It is a full-fledged campaign launched across all media 
            channels including the print and the electronic media all over the 
            world to sell India’s tourism potential to the world. Every crisis 
            presents itself with an opportunity and one has to capitalise on 
            this, he remarked. With its thriving economy and business conference 
            tourism offers large opportunities; while its wildlife tourism in 
            national parks with varied flora and fauna and adventure tourism in 
            diverse landscapes ranging from vast expanses of deserts to the 
            majestic Himalayas make up for the different experiences that India 
            offers.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Medical tourism</b><br>
            India ranks as the second largest destination in medical tourism 
            after Thailand, with 450,000 patients from abroad having received 
            treatment in India during the year 2007 alone. A two-year study by 
            healthcare researchers from Deloitte reveals that there’s a 
            significant rise in patient arrivals in India from the US, UK, and 
            Europe apart from the usual inflow of patients from neighbouring 
            countries and West Asia. <br>
            <br>
            A number of reasonably priced wellness centres and health spas are 
            coming up in several destinations. Healthcare majors in the eastern 
            part of the country too are wooing international patients with 
            special offerings. Leading players in the field like the Calcutta 
            Medical research Institute (CMRI), Medica Synergy Limited (MSL), 
            Apollo Gleneagles, BM Birla Heart Research Centre, are offering 
            added facilities. Apollo is expecting a 30-40 per cent increase in 
            international patients this year, mostly from the US, UK, Italy and 
            Germany.<br>
            <br>
            According to Sadana, the government of India has started a scheme 
            known as medical visa to facilitate and promote medical tourism to 
            India since the past two years. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Hospitality sector</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="tourism4.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="206">India also boasts of incomparable five star services with its motto 
            of “serving a guest is like serving god”. The country’s hospitality 
            sector is expected to rise to around $275bn in the next 10 years. 
            The domestic hospitality sector is expected to see investments of 
            over $11bn in the next two years alone with 40 international hotel 
            brands lined up to set foot in the country in the next few years.<br>
            <br>
            Two of the well-known hotel groups which are participating in this 
            Visit India 2009 promotion are the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces; 
            and Oberoi Hotels &amp; Resorts.<br>
            <br>
            Established in 1903, Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces is one of Asia’s 
            largest and finest group of hotels, comprising 65 hotels in 45

            Africa and the Middle East. From world-renowned landmarks to modern 
            business hotels, idyllic beach resorts to authentic Rajput palaces, 
            each Taj hotel offers an unrivalled fusion of warm Indian 
            hospitality, world-class service and modern luxury. The Taj, a 
            symbol of Indian hospitality, has completed the centenary of its 
            landmark hotel, The Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, Mumbai. Taj Hotels 
            Resorts and Palaces is part of the Tata Group, India’s premier 
            business house.<br>
            <br>
            Oberoi Hotels &amp; Resorts are synonymous the world over with providing 
            the right blend of luxury, impeccable service and quiet efficiency. 
            Internationally recognised for all-round excellence and unparalleled 
            levels of service, Oberoi Hotels &amp; Resorts have the distinction of 
            receiving innumerable awards and accolades. Three Oberoi hotels were 
            ranked among the six best in the world by the readers in Travel + 
            Leisure World’s Best Awards 2008. The Oberoi Rajvilas, Jaipur; The 
            Oberoi Udaivilas, Udaipur and The Oberoi Amarvilas, Agra were rated 
            2nd, 4th and 6th best hotels in the world respectively.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Emphasis on infrastructure</b><br>
            The Indian government is laying particular emphasis in the 
            development of airport and roads infrastructure through 
            public-private partnerships, devising innovative fiscal incentives 
            such as longer tax holidays for the hospitality sector, and adopting 
            aggressive marketing strategies to position India as an attractive 
            tourist destination globally through a series of road shows in 
            strategic cities across continents.<br>
            <br>
            Tourists coming to India from the Middle East would be in a better 
            position to appreciate our land as there are many cultural 
            similarities between Indians and the Arabs, points out Sadana while 
            saying that the GCC region has been the spinal cord of foreign 
            tourist arrivals to India. There were nearly 2.5 lakh tourists from 
            UAE alone last year while there were around 30,000 Omanis who 
            visited India. The former Indian finance minister P Chidambaram had 
            sanctioned INR10bn (RO 82.01mn) as tourism plan allocation in the 
            last budget to boost the country’s efforts to attract more tourists.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Easy connectivity</b><br>
            India is a vast country and it has diverse places abounding in both 
            natural beauty and historical and cultural heritage. And to visit 
            these places, one will definitely need to do a lot of travelling 
            within India itself. In order to facilitate this, Jet Airways has 
            become a partner of Visit India 2009 together with Kingfisher 
            airlines and Air India. Jet Airways is offering a Companion Free 
            Offer wherein you get two tickets at the cost of one and you and 
            your companion can travel at amazing fares.<br>
            <br>
            With an average fleet age of 4.53 years, the airline has one of the 
            youngest aircraft fleets in the world. The airline operates flights 
            to 63 destinations spanning the length and breadth of India and 
            beyond, including New York (both JFK and Newark), Toronto, Brussels, 
            London (Heathrow), Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Colombo, 
            Bangkok, Kathmandu, Dhaka, Kuwait, Bahrain, Muscat, Doha, Abu Dhabi 
            and Dubai. Jet Airways has numerous awards to its credit and is the 
            only private airline from India flying to international 
            destinations.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Rural tourism</b><br>
            Tourism growth potential can be harnessed as a strategy for Rural 
            Development. The development of a strong platform around the concept 
            of Rural tourism is definitely useful for a country like India.<br>
            <br>
            With almost 74 per cent of its population residing in over seven 
            million villages, rural tourism has a lot of potential in India. 
            Therefore India has begun a process of developing a strong platform 
            around the concept of rural tourism and has identified around 137 
            locations in various states of India to attract foreign tourists. 
            According to Pronab Sarkar, honorary secretary, Indian Association 
            of Tour Operators (IATO), the national body of tour operators, home 
            stay is commonly available in many places in India, where a tourist 
            stays like a guest in a house. <br>
            <br>
            But IATO has taken this a step further by identifying certain 
            villages in certain states where tourists can stay for one day and 
            experience the traditions, heritage and culture of a particular 
            area. As Indian villages have been the microcosm of India, much of 
            the history is woven around these small places. IATO is organising 
            and promoting rural tourism all across the country.&nbsp; <br>

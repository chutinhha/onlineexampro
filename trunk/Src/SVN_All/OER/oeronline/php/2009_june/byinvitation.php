            by the recent crisis, many ask me: how will investing change? A tall 
            question, without a short answer. It is safe to predict that in the 
            decade ahead risk will reprice (it already has), innovation will 
            pause, regulation will rise, leverage will languish and, circling 
            back, risk will be rethought. As the economist, formerly known as 
            ‘maestro’ Greenspan testified recently, “The modern risk-management 
            paradigm held sway for decades (but) the whole intellectual edifice, 
            however, collapsed” in 2008. The decade ahead will surely be 
            transformational, although we don’t fully know yet how. Markets can 
            only be understood backwards, yet we invest leaning forward. One 
            thing is for sure, “We can’t solve problems using the same kind of 
            thinking we used when we created them”, said Einstein. Much must 
            change and my prescription follows, centered around trust, 
            innovation, globalisation and investment discipline.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Restore trust</b><br>
            This is clearly where to start. A lot was risked and quickly lost in 
            recent years. Not just immense personal wealth but, more 
            importantly, slowly-nurtured institutional trust. Eminent observers 
            have eviscerated the banking industry as “evil concealed within a 
            widely accepted business model” and an “administrative economic 
            massacre of such proportion that it constitutes an economic crime 
            against humanity”, in the recent stinging words of Shoshana Zuboff, 
            a reputed retired Harvard professor. As many struggle to understand 
            the chaos and call for a global banking renaissance, the words of 
            Voltaire remind, “God is a comedian playing to an audience too 
            afraid to laugh”; our residual risk is irreverence.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Redirect innovation</b><br>
            In the last quarter century of what was labeled the ‘Great 
            Moderation’, we possibly saw more financial innovation than in the 
            past century. Much of it was beneficial. Yet the undesirable crept 
            in, leveraged up and overwhelmed. In the past generation, bank 
            leverage ratios rocketed from 5x to 15x with some investment banking 
            divisions running at 50x. The legendary Benjamin Graham’s famed 
            “margin of safety” disappeared from the banks that once preached it. 
            The financial services sector has expanded from four per cent of US 
            GDP in 1980 to eight per cent of GDP in 2008, from having none of 
            its firms included in the Dow Jones index of 30 to having 3, from 
            weight of below 10 per cent in the S&amp;P 500 index to a peak of 35 per 
            cent in 2006 and back down to about 12 per cent today. The moral 
            hazard of bailing out 30x leveraged long term capital management in 
            1998 came home to roost a full decade later with Lehman and AIG. 
            Innovation must continue globally but on the axes of macro and micro 
            risk management – especially fixing the mismatch between global 
            finance and narrow national regulation. Previously ignored 
            prescriptions on risk management must be revamped and implemented, 
            such as those outlined by Yale’s eminent Robert Shiller in his 
            research paper ‘Radical Financial Innovation’, published presciently 
            early in 2004, or by the ‘messianic’ billionaire George Soros in 
            early 2008 in ‘New Paradigm for Financial Markets’, again 
            clairvoyantly penned before Lehman’s epic collapse.<br>

            <img border="0" src="inv1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="177" height="281"><b>Reaffirm 
            globalisation</b><br>
            At the recent G20 summit the “G2” mattered most -- America and China 
            are key to critically sustaining and extending globalisation. The 
            once-soaring eagle must continue its awkward dance with the restless 
            dragon. But the largest beneficiary of globalisation heretofore, 
            China, is under pressure to revalue its currency and further open 
            its consumer markets. With its centralised and opaque governance 
            structure, there is justified fear about the corrective course it 
            will pursue if its current aggressive stimulus programme fails to 
            stoke consumer spending which is a key success factor for 
            sustainable recovery. In the battered US, there is a push in 
            Congress for some form of protectionism as payback for the electoral 
            support of the unions; it will be Obama’s test and formidable 
            challenge to stand up to the extreme left. <br>
            <br>
            In the heart of capitalism, a credible US public opinion survey in 
            2009 produced incredible results: that only 53 per cent now believe 
            capitalism offers a better economic model and 20 per cent prefer 
            socialism. In red-capitalist China, which witnessed over 60,000 
            social protests in prosperous 2006, what will be the consequence of 
            the twenty million and counting who have lost employment in the past 
            year? As the French will confirm, most revolutions start off as 
            bread riots. During times of terrible travail, societies make hasty, 
            large and often poorly conceived decisions; Obama’s recent ‘Buy 
            American” provisions are ominous and incongruent with the fact that 
            over half of S&amp;P 500 company profits are harvested overseas. The 
            blunderous 1930 Smoot-Hawley act was enacted despite over a thousand 
            professional economists and eminent business leaders, including the 
            CEO’s of Ford and JP Morgan, lobbying and pleading against it. A 
            painful four years later it was partially reversed with Roosevelt’s 
            Trade Agreement as part of the New Deal, but it was not until the 
            GATT agreement of the 1950s that global trade was fully resurrected. 
            With global trade a far greater contributor to economic well-being 
            today, we can only hope that this time around protectionist history 
            will neither repeat nor rhyme.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Recommit to discipline</b><br>
            The more things change the more they stay the same. One constant in 
            the investment world is that discipline pays. Since there are large 
            uncertainties regarding the direction of innovation and the 
            trajectory of global capitalism, our investment portfolios should be 
            sufficiently diversified between risky and safe asset classes and at 
            all times cushioned with risk-lowering hedging techniques. Consider 
            the current debate about deflation and inflation and its 
            implications for portfolio construction since the asset classes and 
            financial instruments to own in these widely disparate scenarios 
            differ substantially.<br>
            <br>
            Which camp is fundamentally correct? The pessimists predict a 
            near-Japanese-style extended period of deflation since they view the 
            current stimulus plans as insufficient to bridge the wide 
            macroeconomic output gap resulting in structural overcapacity for 
            years. The optimists expect the recovery to take hold later this 
            year and growth, albeit below trend, to sustain even past the 
            one-time benefits of various stimuli. Yet these optimists will turn 
            pessimist when inflation takes root a couple of years hence. Which 
            scenario to account for in your portfolio? Depending on your risk 
            profile and investment horizon, you might need a diversified 
            portfolio which incorporates some hedges for both. If extracting 
            retirement income from the portfolio over the next decade or longer 
            is a requirement, inflation hedging and income immunisation 
            strategies should be used. If the investment horizon is long and 
            there is no income requirement, a growth oriented portfolio with a 
            few deflation hedges can be created to take advantage of distressed 
            market pricing. <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, investing has always been a game of navigating 
            uncertainty and the only anti-dote to that is a disciplined 
            research-led investment process with continual adjustments or 
            rebalancing as the macro situation evolves. More so than ever 
            before, what lies ahead is unknowable. As Churchill once opined 
            about Russia, so can we today about the investment decade ahead, “a 
            riddle wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma”. The key is investor 
            welfare.<br>

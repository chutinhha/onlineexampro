                On May 31, 2009 all roads (for CEO’s) led to the Capital Market 
                Authority -- the venue for the first OER Top 20 Debate and 
                Awards. Going by the Chairmen and CEO’s assembled at the 
                gathering one could safely assume that over half of the 
                corporate sectors networth had assembled at the CMA. Leaders of 
                industry, ministers, dignitaries and representatives of the 
                international and local media were all there. The anticipation 
                for the event had been building up over the last two weeks of 
                May and it was time now to throw open the doors for the real 
                thing.<br>
                <br>
                Welcoming the guests, Sandeep Sehgal, CEO, United Media Services 
                said, “While most part of 2008 there was a lot of buoyancy; we 
                all have lived through how it has welcomed 2009 and are 
                embracing 2009 with all its challenges that have been summed up 
                time and again as being the issue of ‘sentiment.” H E Yahya al 
                Jabri, Executive President, Capital Market Authority elucidated 
                the purpose of the debate stating, “The purpose of the debate is 
                not just to indulge in an intellectually stimulating exercise, 
                but an initiative to give industry ideas and solutions for their 
                respective businesses. If all of us can go back with a few 
                definite takeaways from today’s debate, it would be well worth 
                the effort.” Delivering the keynote address, H E Maqbool bin Ali 
                Sultan, the Minister of Commerce and Industry and the guest of 
                honour mentioned that the Sultanate’s economy has grown by leaps 
                and bounds since the blessed Renaissance began in 1970. “The GDP 
                has grown 185-fold from $270mn in 1970 to around $50bn last 
                year. Per capita income has soared 50-fold from $400 in 1970 to 
                $20,000 in 2008.” </font>

                The debate on the ‘Global Financial Crisis and its impact on the 
                Sultanates economy’ saw the panelists and the audience 
                discussing various aspects of the economy. Speaking during the 
                course of the debate, Abdulrazak Ali Essa, Chief Executive, 
                BankMuscat, said, “The economic crisis may have eased, but the 
                financial crisis is far from over and we need to wait till the 
                fourth quarter to see the real impact.” Stephen Thomas, CEO, 
                Renaissance Services echoed the view, “There are still 
                uncertainties ahead, not least volatility of oil price; but 2008 
                oil revenue windfalls, prudent fiscal policy and stringent bank 
                lending regulations has left Oman and other GCC economies in a 
                good position to weather the global crisis.” Faisal al Hashar, 
                Managing Director, Shell Oman Marketing Company added that while 
                the current growth may be slow it is acceptable in the light of 
                the global crisis. Some panelists gave insights about how they 
                were negotiating the crisis. “We are working on giving solutions 
                to corporate houses and better management,” said Dr Amer al 
                Rawas, CEO, Omantel. Hans Meiring, COO, Oman Cables said that 
                the company is working on better inventory management and has 
                started manufacturing ancillary products in Oman rather than 
                importing them. Murray Sims, CEO, NBO struck a cautious note, 
                “We are witnessing the first signs of a deterioration in asset 
                quality, as banks in the region have started defaulting on their 
                debt.” But Hans Erlings, CEO, Galfar sounded upbeat, “The future 
                is stable and we have not really experienced any slowdown.” The 
                debate was moderated by Philip Stanton, Managing Partner, 
                Ernst&amp;Young. Says Alpana Roy, Vice President, UMS, “The OER Top 
                20 Debate generated an overwhelming response from various 
                stakeholders with business leaders from every sector 
                participating in the deliberations and gaining from the incisive 
                ideas and insights thrown up by the debate.” <br>
                <br>
                The debate was followed by an awards ceremony in which The OER 
                Top 20 companies were awarded OER Top 20 trophies by H H Sayyid 
                Tarik bin Shabib, Editor-in-Chief, Oman Economic Review, HE 
                Maqbool Ali Sultan and HE Yahya al Jabri. The winners included 
                Omantel, Galfar Engineering and Construction, BankMuscat, Shell 
                Oman Marketing , Oman Cables Industry, Renaissance Services, Al 
                Maha Petroleum, Oman Oil Marketing Company, National Bank of 
                Oman, Oman Holdings International, Raysut Cement, Oman Cement 
                Co, Areej Vegetable Oils and Derivatives, Bank Dhofar, Oman 
                International Bank, Oman Flour Mills Company, Ominvest, Al 
                Hassan Engineering, Al Anwar Holdings and Al Jazeera Steel 
                Products. Al Madina Financial and Investment Services Company 
                and Bank Sohar partnered the event while Times of Oman was the 
                media partner. ‘A great start’, ‘One of the best corporate 
                events ever staged in Oman’ and ‘Wow’ were some of the responses 
                that the OER Top 20 debate generated. Having set a new 
                benchmark, we were more critical and some may say unduly harsh 
                in our assessment of the event -- the tone of the debate was a 
                bit tepid, it lacked firepower and could have been more 
                provocative were some of the responses that our colleagues came 
                up with. We promise to go back to the drawing board and welcome 
                business leaders to a far more powerful and dynamic OER Top 20 
                debate in 2010. Till then – let the debate continue. </font>

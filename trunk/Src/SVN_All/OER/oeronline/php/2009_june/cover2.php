            Petroleum Development Oman: <br>
            A Planet-Friendly Mindset Takes Over</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            <b>A look at how Petroleum Development Oman is contributing to 
            environment preservation</b><br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover26.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="183">For large corporate incumbents in the oil and gas industry such as 
            Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), making a positive contribution to 
            the environment does not always come naturally. “A major change in 
            the company’s DNA is required not to mention a commitment by 
            management and shareholders alike to put the planet before financial 
            performance,” explains PDO’s Head of Environment Khalifa al Harthy. 
            “But changing its corporate DNA is precisely what PDO has done.”<br>
            <br>
            One of the results of this change has been a radical re-think of the 
            way it consumes energy and how it can mitigate the effect of its 
            operations. PDO has been producing oil and gas for over 40 years and 
            operates over 120 oilfields throughout Oman. In order to maintain 
            oil production – and secure Oman’s income for future generations – 
            PDO consumes a massive amount of electric power. To put this into 
            perspective, PDO’s operations use as much electricity as the whole 
            of greater Muscat (population one million). Much of this power is 
            used to pump water into oilfields to maintain reservoir pressure and 
            will soon be used in enhanced oil recovery projects using schemes to 
            inject steam into oilfield.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Cogeneration</b><br>
            To meet its rapidly growing power requirements, PDO planned to 
            construct several new power stations. As a direct result of its new 
            planet-friendly mindset, PDO scrapped plans to site plants where the 
            power was required. Instead, at a considerable extra cost, it chose 
            to locate the plants at oilfields where waste heat could be used to 
            generate steam for oilfield injection. From these power stations, 
            PDO will generate steam using exhaust heat that previously would 
            have been wasted by direct venting to the atmosphere. The 
            temperature of these exhaust gases is over 500 degrees C and can be 
            used to make steam – a process referred to as cogeneration. This 
            cogeneration takes place in a “Heat Recovery Steam Generation” unit 
            that is built adjacent to the power station. By utilising the power 
            station waste heat cogeneration, the energy for the steam is 
            provided without additional firing of
            fuel and there are no additional emissions that go on to contribute 
            to green house effect.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover27.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="192" height="261">Three power plants linked to cogeneration units currently under 
            construction will save nearly one million tonnes of CO2/yr compared 
            to the traditional direct-firing approaches. A further network of 
            linked thermal EOR projects and power stations will be constructed 
            over the coming years. These projects will help PDO realise a total 
            emissions savings of over four million tonnes of CO2/yr within five 
            years. Further power station and EOR expansions will yield savings 
            totalling well over six million tonnes CO2/yr within the decade. 
            This re-think has not come cheaply. The heat recovery units 
            typically add about 30 per cent to the cost of the power stations. 
            As well, the power must be transported to the demand centres via an 
            overhead power line network that has required expansion and 
            reinforcement. PDO has shown it is committed to finding 
            environmentally-friendly solutions to its strategic investments. It 
            has realised that in addition to protecting the planet, there is an 
            eventual payback in terms of the reduced fuel requirement. PDO 
            recognises that what makes good environmental sense also makes good 
            business sense. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Greening the desert</b><br>
            In the barren desert of Nimr in South Oman, dust and sand will soon 
            give way to a green oasis. Taking its cue from the ancient Egyptians 
            who used natural reed beds to clean up dirty water, PDO is using the 
            age-old principle to remove oil from water produced alongside oil 
            productionSuch water is currently re-injected into deep reservoirs 
            where it can be safely stored without affecting groundwater, a 
            process known as deep water disposal. After a successful eight-year 
            experiment, the Nimr reed bed project is set to treat 45,000 cubic 
            metres per day of water from local oilfields. PDO will create a 
            giant farm with 240 hectares (2.4 million square metres) of reed 
            beds which will become operational in early 2011. “Our trials 
            demonstrated that reed beds are a technically viable alternative to 
            deep water disposal,” explains Khalifa al Harthy “Reed beds reduce 
            energy consumption due to the elimination of the need to pump the 
            water underground and will therefore lead to a reduction in PDO’s 
            carbon generation as well as introducing a carbon sink by the reed 
            uptake of CO2”<br>
            <br>
            <b>Using solar power to generate steam</b><br>
            South Oman is the site of another technological step forward aimed 
            at limiting the carbon footprint of PDO’s operations. At Thayfut, 
            PDO is embarking on its first solar energy project. Approval was 
            recently obtained for a pilot project known as “Thayfut solar steam 
            generation pilot”. If successful, the project could lead to step 
            change in way PDO generates energy for its thermal enhanced oil 
            recovery (EOR) projects. “This is an important strategic project in 
            which we will test a promising new technology,” says Head of New 
            Technology Implementation, Shaikhan Khaduri. “This is the first time 
            parabolic trough technology has been used to generate steam 
            directly.” Under the project, PDO will install parabolic troughs 
            which will be used to generate steam for injection into underground 
            reservoirs. Parabolic troughs work by concentrating the sun’s rays 
            onto receiver tubes carrying water which under the intense heat then 
            turns into steam. The Thayfut location was chosen for the trials 
            because the field is subject to a planned steam injection project 
            which will include the building of a reverse osmosis water treatment 
            plant. This will provide water for the solar project and allow the 
            steam to be injected into a parallel project. PDO’s corporate 
            technology teams believe that the pilot system to be installed could 
            produce as much as 100 tonnes of steam a day based on ten hours of 
            sunshine. The Thayfut steam pilot is planning to generate 200 tonnes 
            of steam using conventional gas-fired turbines. The objective of the 
            pilot project is to understand the operability and the 
            maintainability of the technology, Shaikhan Khaduri explains. The 
            technology has been used in Spain and the United States but has 
            never been tested in the tough conditions of the Omani desert. The 
            other aim of the project is to demonstrate whether it can be 
            seamlessly integrated into an existing steam injection project. If 
            successful, solar-generated steam could be injected during the day 
            and conventional steam at night. Longer term potentialities of the 
            technology is to use the steam to generate electricity or to heat 
            water before it goes to boilers in conventional gas-fired steam 
            power plants.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Changing mindsets</b><br>
            PDO knows that its ability to continue improving its environmental 
            performance depends on changing the mindsets of its own staff. In 
            order to promote environmental and sustainable development (SD) 
            awareness within PDO, the company regularly holds mini-workshops. 
            The purpose of the workshops was to help project planners to 
            incorporate SD principles into new projects. Leaving oilfields in a 
            pristine condition once operations end is another ongoing area of 
            focus for the company. PDO has an ambitious ongoing well-abandonment 
            campaign aimed at returning oilfields to their original state. Last 
            years, 74 wells were closed down in a safe and environmentally 
            friendly manner. In addition, a further 17 oil production sites in 
            the Musallim area were subject to a full restoration programme, 
            including the removal of contaminated soil. In recent years, PDO has 
            continued to implement an aggressive flare-reduction programme. In 
            2008, 1.71 million cubic metres of gas per day were flared – 10 per 
            cent less than in 2007. In addition, Global Warming Potential was 
            well below target on account of the company’s more efficient 
            generation of its electric power. The company’s actual atmospheric 
            emissions were only 6.13 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, against a 
            target of 7.07 million tonnes CO2 equivalent.<br>

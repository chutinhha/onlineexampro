                strategically located in the heart of South East Asia, offers a 
                cost-competitive location for investors intending to set up 
                offshore operations for the manufacture of advanced 
                technological products for regional and international markets.<br>
                <br>
                Supported by a market-oriented economy and pro-business 
                government policies, Malaysia offers investors a dynamic and 
                vibrant business environment with the ideal prerequisites for 
                growth and profits. Malaysia’s key strengths include a 
                well-developed infrastructure including five international 
                airports and seven international seaports making it an ideal 
                springboard to the Asia-Pacific market. A productive workforce, 
                a politically stable country with a well-developed legal system 
                also provides attractive incentives for investors.<br>
                <br>
                Industries in Malaysia are predominantly located in over 200 
                industrial estates and Free Zones developed throughout the 
                country. These zones are categorised as export processing zones, 
                which cater to the requirements of export-oriented industries. 
                There are also specialised parks that have been developed to 
                cater to the needs of specific industries.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Economic Overview </b><br>
                Malaysia is an active trading nation, ranked in the top 20 
                trading nations in the world. It is an open economy with 
                international trade that is twice the size of its GDP. In 2007, 
                the country for the first time breached RM1 trillion in total 
                trade. During the past five years, Malaysia’s GDP has been 
                growing at a stable annual rate of 5-6 per cent of GDP. Malaysia 
                practices liberal market policies aimed at promoting trade, 
                entrepreneurship, industrial and economic development. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Incentives </b><br>
                Malaysia welcomes foreign investments, particularly in the 
                manufacturing sector and offers many incentives and other 
                advantages to foreign investors. Foreign investors in the 
                manufacturing sector can hold 100 per cent of the equity in a 
                Malaysian company. A company with foreign paid up capital of 
                $2mn and above will be allowed up to 10 expatriate posts, 
                including five key posts. Under local tax laws, specific tax 
                incentives are aimed at stimulating investment in manufacturing, 
                biotechnology, information technology and Islamic financing. 
                Generous tax write-offs are allowed in the form of double 
                deductions, tax holiday status and additional deduction on 
                qualifying capital expenditure. The Malaysian Industrial 
                Development Authority (MIDA) is the government’s principal 
                agency for the promotion of the manufacturing and services 
                sectors in Malaysia. MIDA assists companies which intend to 
                invest in the manufacturing and its related services sectors as 
                well as facilitates the implementation and operation of their 
                projects. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Structure of business entities </b><br>
                A number of structures are possible. Private companies, with 
                limited liability, are the most common form of business entity 
                in Malaysia.

                  <b>Limited Liability Companies</b><br>
                  These companies are characterised by a restriction on the

                  shareholders to a maximum of 50 and a prohibition to offer its

                  <b>Partnerships and Sole Traders<br>
                  </b>All sole proprietorships and partnerships must be registered 
                  with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM). In the case 
                  of partnerships, partners are both jointly and severally 
                  liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. 
                  Formal partnership deeds may be drawn up but this is not 
                  obligatory.

                  <b>Branches of Foreign Companies</b><br>
                  Under the Companies Act, a foreign company that establishes a 
                  place of business in Malaysia must register with the CCM. 
                  Registration takes up to a month and registration fees are 
                  payable in accordance with graduated scales based on the 
                  authorised capital of the parent company. Every company shall 
                  within a month of establishing a place of business or 
                  commencing business within Malaysia lodge with the CCM, notice 
                  of the location of its registered office in Malaysia.

                <b>Structures used by foreign investors </b><br>
                The form most commonly used by foreign investors is a private 
                company. Such company must maintain a registered office in 
                Malaysia where all books and documents required under the 
                provisions of the Companies Act are kept. <br>
                <br>
                Annual formalities are minimal, except for the requirements to 
                prepare annual financial statements and to have them audited and 
                filed with the CCM. The establishment of a branch of a foreign 
                company should be considered if the company would engage in less 
                than a full operation in Malaysia, such as through a 
                representative office. Branches of foreign companies are subject 
                to income tax of 25 per cent.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Tax implications </b><br>
                Resident and non-resident companies are taxed only on income 
                accruing in or derived from Malaysia. A company is resident in 
                Malaysia if its management and control is exercised in Malaysia; 
                the place of incorporation is irrelevant. The income tax rate 
                for corporations is currently 25 per cent and is competitive <br>
                to those in the South East Asian countries.<br>
                <br>
                Where a foreign company has a presence in Malaysia, the taxation 
                of its income will depend on the nature of the income derived 
                and whether a Double Tax Agreement (DTA) exists between Malaysia 
                and the country of residence of that company.

                <br>
                <b>Withholding taxes </b><br>
                Malaysia implements the single tier system (STS) for the payment 
                of dividends. Under the STS, income tax payable on the normal 
                chargeable income of a company is a final tax in Malaysia. Any 
                dividends distributed by the company will be exempt from tax in 
                the hands of the shareholders. There is also no dividend 
                withholding tax imposed on dividends distributed to non-resident 
                shareholders.<br>
                <br>
                Withholding tax is imposed on the following payments to 
                non-residents:</font><ul>

                <b><br>
                Income tax</b><br>
                Individual income tax is levied at graduated rates, with a 
                maximum marginal rate of 27 per cent (reached at an income level 
                of RM 250,000). Employers must withhold tax at a rate of 27 per 
                cent from wages paid to non-resident employees. <br>
                <br>
                The other significant taxes to be considered by the foreign 
                investor include stamp duties, customs and excise duties and 
                property tax such as quit rent and assessment. Malaysia has 
                signed Double Tax Agreements with 68 countries, a couple of 
                which are limited treaties. Malaysia does not have a Double Tax 
                Agreement with the Sultanate of Oman.<br>

                <img border="0" src="view2.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="201">Malaysia’s 
                multi-lingual, multi-skilled talent pool is one of the country’s 
                competitive advantages. The country offers the investor a labour 
                force that is diligent, educated and trainable. Malaysia does 
                not have a general social security system providing benefits; 
                however, employers are required to register with the Social 
                Security Organisation (SOCSO). SOCSO provides social security 
                protection by social insurance including medical and cash 
                benefits. Employers must pay 1.75 per cent for the Employment 
                Injury Insurance Scheme and the Invalidity Pension Scheme while 
                the employee’s share of 0.5 per cent of wages should be paid for 
                coverage under the Invalidity Pension Scheme. <br>
                <br>
                Malaysia has always maintained a liberal foreign exchange 
                administration policy. The implementation of foreign exchange 
                administration policy in Malaysia supports the monitoring of 
                capital flows into and out of the country to preserve its 
                financial and economic stability. There are also no restrictions 
                on the repatriation of capital, profits or income earned in 
                Malaysia. The ringgit may not however be traded overseas and 
                payments outside Malaysia should be made in foreign currency.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Import regulation </b><br>
                Malaysia is a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and 
                follows the Harmonised System of product classification and the 
                WTO Customs Rules of Valuation.<br>
                <br>
                Under the Customs (Prohibition of Imports) Order 2008, selected 
                categories of goods are absolutely prohibited. Certain other 
                categories of goods are conditionally prohibited and such goods 
                may be imported into Malaysia with an import permit issued by 
                the relevant authorities. Although the relevant government 
                ministries are empowered to regulate imports into Malaysia, most 
                goods may be imported into Malaysia without restrictions.<br>
                <br>
                Malaysia’s strategic location provides a premier starting point 
                for investors seeking business development in the region. With a 
                well developed infrastructure, a productive workforce and an 
                extensive trade network with other economies, Malaysia offers 
                investors a dynamic environment with the ideal prerequisites for 
                growth, business opportunities and profits.<br>

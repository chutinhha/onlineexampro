            &quot;Scheeewoo-h-ookkk'! Try saying it again and again... That is the 
            sound of decapitation<img border="0" src="movie_re.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="132"> at the hands of and under the mighty sword of 
            &quot;The Bride' (played brilliantly by Uma Thurman) in yet another 
            masterpiece by the blood Maestro of funk Quentin Tarantino. 
            Reviewing a QT flick is an intrinsically challenging task. <br>
            <br>
            Kill Bill Vol.1 (and Vol.2 for that matter) in essence, is a tribute 
            to the cult of the Martial Arts movies of the early seventies. The 
            story is simple. The theme is naked in your face; Uma is hurt so Uma 
            seeks revenge and in doing so Uma chops a few, well, quite a few 
            heads along the way. She single-handedly eradicates the &quot;crazy 88 
            fighters' and their relentless leader &quot;O-Ren Ishii' Oh... I forgot 
            to mention that before retiring the 88 useless fighters, Uma has 
            dirtied her hands with the killing of the &quot;Deadly Viper'! <br>
            <br>
            Where was I? Ah! Half of the joy of a QT movie lies in the way these 
            unfortunate characters die (I apologise for the sadistic tone of 
            this review, but hey I just walked out of KILL BILL, when the time 
            comes to review the next Tom Hanks movie, I will be there to support 
            your tears. Rest assured) <br>
            <br>
            There is style galore in this first volume of Kill Bill so much so 
            that it can establish a whole neo-cult of the modern era of “funk-o-fide' 
            Martial Arts Genre. Tarantino's mastery of the camera is almost a 
            fetish. He executes each scene with almost the same mania as does 
            “The Bride' executing her nemeses. Yes it is true that we are 
            viewing 93 minutes of a phantasmagoria of violence and gore, but the 
            style and the passion with which Kill Bill was directed tames it 
            into an artistic expression (Pheeeww! What the hell was that??!) Run 
            to the store, grab your copy of the DVD and try to kill Bill. <br>
            <br>
            (Kill Bill was initially shot as one film, however; it was the 
            suggestion of Miramax to slice it into two volumes.) ****(out of 4)

            min) </font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
            <br>
            With Oscar time come the dramas, the smoochies and the epics.<img border="0" src="movie_re1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="129"> This 
            latest entry from Director Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, Glory, 
            Courage Under Fire) combines all of the previously mentioned genres 
            and adds a few more. The result is good, BUT (tana na na...) <br>
            <br>
            <b>Synopsis: </b><br>
            n ex-American Captain, Nathan Algren, (Tom Cruise, and NO he doesn’t 
            deserve an Oscar nomination for this one) is on the brinks of 
            self-destruction, when timely he is rescued to re-organise the 
            Japanese army for fighting the rebel forces. So the hunky Cruise 
            packs up his bags and heads down to the land of the Samurai. He 
            fights his first battle, but is captured by the rebels. After 
            spending time with the rebel Samurai, Nathan realises what a moral 
            buffoon he is, and so he joins the Samurai against the ultimate 
            fight of good vs. evil. (Evil being the corrupt Japanese government 
            officials, and the greedy American Capitalists!! Reminder: This 
            ain't a documentary!) <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Positive Aspects of The Last Samurai: </b><br>
            1. Spectacular Battle scenes (ok not as good as The Lord of the 
            Rings) <br>
            2. Ken Watanabe who plays Katsumoto, the leader/ teacher of the 
            rebel Samurais <br>
            3. Koyuki (Taka) the only female in the movie <br>
            4. Good direction, it almost successfully apologises for The Legends 
            of the Fall <br>
            5. Cinematography is almost breathtaking <br>
            6. This is a ‘Very Entertaining’ movie, well, up until the last 20 
            minutes The Negative Aspects: 1. It’s 20 minutes too long 2. I 
            thought James Bond was invincible, wait till you meet Nathan Algren 
            3. The political correctness that oozes throughout the movie 4. The 
            preachy, clichÈd “good conquers all' ending <br>
            <br>
            My tone might have been too harsh! It's a movie that the majority 
            would like; it has all the ingredients of Hollywood. It is a solid 
            good movie, but it is never great (although it thinks it is) ***

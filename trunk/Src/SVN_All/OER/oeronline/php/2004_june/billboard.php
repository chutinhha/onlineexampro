                    Hyundai Motors America moved up eight ranks from last year 
                    when it finished second in the JD Power rankings. The 
                    automobile company now ranks higher than all European and US 
                    auto makers with regard to vehicle quality based complaints 
                    reported by customers during the initial months of 
                    ownership. Hyundai Sonata topped all entry-level midsized 
                    sedans in JD Power's ranking. Hyundai's Accent and Santa Fe 
                    (SUV) were also rated very high, both slotted at No. 2 in 
                    their respective categories of 'compact car' and 'entry SUV'. 
                    Every model in Hyundai's US model line-up is now ranked 
                    above industry average in JD Power's IQS rankings. The

                    Shawqi Barwani chats with Ali Al-Muscati, the managing 
                    director, of the AIB-Vincotte International &amp; Partners LLC, 
                    (AVI Oman) on increasing the competitive edge Achieving 
                    business success is sometimes like wrestling an octopus. 
                    Every time you think you're making headway, a tentacle grabs 
                    you and pulls you under. The octopus in mind that, at times, 
                    seems to have us by the arms, legs, throat and, most 
                    importantly, the pocket, includes the limited availability 
                    of clients with deep pockets pursued by a mob of aggressive 
                    hungry companies. To stay ahead of the chase, one needs to 
                    employ a wide range of strategies to wrestle this octopus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not only has he succeeded to keep the tentacles at bay, Ali 
                    Al-Muscati, the managing director of the AIB-Vincotte 
                    International &amp; Partners LLC (AVI Oman), has managed to keep 
                    ahead of competition since the establishment of the 
                    prestigious quality assurance firm in Oman five years ago. 
                    Maintaining the high standards of its parent company, AVI 
                    Oman offers services in the fields of Management System 
                    Certification ISO 9000, Third Party Inspection, Safety, 
                    Non-Destructive Testing, and Training besides providing 
                    specialised HR services. <br>
                    <br>
                    Research shows that firms which adopt ISO9000 tend to be 
                    larger, multi-product firms in the manufacturing sector 
                    dealing with customers that are larger than themselves or 
                    are government departments. In that sense, ISO 9000 
                    Certification has been a victim of its own success. Till 
                    date, over 450,000 organisations worldwide are ISO certified 
                    and the list is growing daily. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;ISO Certification gives you an edge and emphasises to 
                    potential customers and suppliers that you've made a serious 
                    effort to ensure your products and services meet the highest 
                    quality standards possible. It also opens opportunities 
                    you'd otherwise miss because, increasingly, clients will 
                    usually do business with only ISO-certified firms,&quot; remarks 
                    Ali Al-Muscati. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;At AVI Oman, we offer a full range of consulting services 
                    and specialise in helping organisations to install the right 
                    quality systems for their business. We assist small 
                    businesses to help implement quality systems in manageable 
                    steps as their needs and budget may dictate,' explains Ali. 
                    &quot;Traditionally, smaller businesses have shied away from 
                    registration,' says Ali. &quot;In Oman, limited budgets and 
                    resources prevented small businesses from establishing a 
                    quality system,&quot; he adds. <br>
                    &quot;However, all that is now changing. Our list of clients is 
                    diverse and ranges from a car dealer and a cement 
                    manufacturing plant to a water pump manufacturing company 
                    and a local community construction. Among the public sector, 
                    our clients include the Omani Centre for Investment 
                    Promotion and Export Development (OCIPED),&quot; discloses Ali. 
                    ÒThe challenges facing us as a certifying body in the public 
                    services include provision of services in sectors which are 
                    not always attractive,&quot; reflect Ali. &quot;To date, we have 
                    managed to register over 22 local Omani companies&quot; quality 
                    management systems to ISO 9000,&quot; he proclaims proudly. ÒISO 
                    9000 certification is a growing trend in Oman. PDO 
                    (Petroleum Development Oman) takes the lion's share in 
                    championing quality improvements of local companies by 
                    insisting that all companies interested in undertaking work 
                    for PDO must be registered to ISO 9000 or demonstrate that 
                    the quality systems are based on ISO 9000.&quot;</font></p>

                    20 years. <br>

                    The Chief Executive of the Chamber, Jean-Michel Laurent, pre<img border="0" src="muscat_phar.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="250" height="170">sented 
                    the award to Dilip Mehta. Present at the function, which was 
                    held at Oman Sheraton Hotel were the French

                    fields and also to those ho have shown outstanding 
                    performance over a period of time in terms of efficiency, 
                    growth and have excelled themselves in their field. It was 
                    stated that this honour has always gone to European 
                    individuals or organizations. But there has been a policy 
                    change during the last two years by which the Chamber has 
                    started considering nominations from within the country for 
                    Award to individuals and organisations outside Europe. This 
                    was also the first time the investiture ceremony was held 
                    outside France. <br>
                    <br>
                    In his acceptance speech, Dilip Mehta traced the relations 
                    between Muscat Pharmacy and the French industry especially 
                    in the medical and personal and beauty care business 
                    spanning over two decades. The Muscat Pharmacy is the first 
                    company outside Europe, in its category, to win this award. </font></p>

            <b>Webcams are a must have PC accessory today with Internet chatting 
            and telephony being the norm of the day. For those who thought that 
            Webcams are used only for video messaging, though, here's some news. 
            The latest Web cameras offer a host of facilities other than 
            conducting video chats. With the latest generation of Web cameras, 
            you can try your hand at making movies, designing web pages, 
            creating picture galleries Ð even conducting interviews. Here's a 
            lowdown on some of the hottest Web cams in the market.</b> <br>
            <br>
            <b>Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks </b><br>
            The Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks is a compact portable USB camera 
            designed<img border="0" src="logi.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="90" height="99"> specifically for laptop PC users. This snugly built Web cam 
            has a video resolution and size that can be adjusted up to 640 x 480 
            pixels. The still image format is JPEG while video data format is AVI. In the video frame rate capacity, it goes up to 30 frames per 
            second. Another interesting feature is the facility to conduct 
            videoconferences from anywhere using Microsoft NetMeeting. The 
            foldaway mount of Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks is quite 
            convenient for organising video chats and e-mail clips from any 
            laptop. However, QuickCam does not come with a microphone. Apart 
            from performing as a Webcam, the Logitech software is activity-based 
            and offers the user several options such as building Web pages, 
            creating picture galleries, or transmitting live video, the 
            limitation being that you can add only a title or credits at the 
            beginning or the end of a clip. <br>

            <b>Logitech ClickSmart 420 </b><br>
            ClickSmart 420 comes with Logitech's Image Studio all-in-one 
            <img border="0" src="log.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="100" height="105">software. It also works as a still and digital camera although it is 
            best used as a Webcam. The video capture capacity is similar to most 
            other Webcams Ð 640 x 480 at up to 30 frames per second. The camera 
            is particularly noteworthy for its low-light sensitivity 
            performance. The picture clarity is much better than most cameras of 
            this genre. It is also very easy to use and install. Although the 
            camera comes with a built-in microphone, it is not very sensitive, 
            as a result of which the audio quality is poor. In short, if you are 
            looking for a Webcam, this is worth going in for. But as a digicam, 
            it's just right for kids. <br>

            snugly into your palm,<img border="0" src="aip.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="100" height="113"> don't let the size fool you. The four-in-one 
            DV3100 functions as a Digital Video Recorder, Digital Voice 
            Recorder, a High Resolution 3.1 mega-pixel Digital Camera, and also 
            a PC Webcam. As a digital camcorder, it can simultaneously record 
            digital video/audio on the spot. The user-friendly software provides 
            info on how you can edit your video file and create your own movies. 
            The voice annotation function allows you to record interviews, 
            narrations and also music. The recording time can be expanded up to 
            30 minutes. To transform the DV3100 into a Webcam, all you have to 
            do is to plug it into your USB port. Still images too can be 
            captured with the camera and it also comes with a wide range of 
            special effects with easy-to-use photo retouching tools. <br>

            <b>Apple iSight </b><br>
            Lightweight, portable and sleek. That's Apple's iSight for you. The 
            hi-tech web camera<img border="0" src="apple.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="100" height="79"> has made video conferencing easy due to the 
            cutting-edge technology involved. The camera has auto focus and auto 
            exposure F/2.8 lens that can capture high-quality pictures. iSight 
            also offers a wider range of shutter speeds than most other cameras 
            and delivers video at 30 frames per second. The colour quality of 
            iSight is impeccable and as a result the resolution is quite sharp. 
            What makes this Webcam stand out is the built-in microphone. The 
            dual element noise-suppressing microphone takes in the sound from 
            both microphone elements, and then determines which sounds are 
            essential to the conversation thereby filtering out extraneous 
            noise. iSight can also be used as a standalone microphone for 
            capturing audio. On the exterior front, the iSight has three stands 
            and a tilt-and-swivel mechanism that makes it possible for the 
            Webcam to capture video at the best possible angle as it can be 
            placed directly in front of you. To top it, the Webcam's compact 
            size makes it easy to take it with you anywhere. A tiny green 'on 
            air' light on the camera lets you know that you are participating in 
            a live video chat session. And to log off the video chat, all that 
            is required is a simple twist of the lens cap. <br>

            though. The camera has an easy-touch snapshot button and a 
            360-degree swivel base that makes it possible to take shots from any

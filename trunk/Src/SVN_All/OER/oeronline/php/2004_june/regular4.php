            Muscat Stock Market gained further ground during the period under 
            review (April 21-<img border="0" src="mascat_mark.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="197">May 23, 2004). The Index took its time to stabilise 
            in the initial days of the period, with the volumes keeping low at 
            around RO2.5 million. The Index twice tried to break the 309-level 
            before pulling back. The reasons that affected the sentiments of the 
            retail investors during this period included BankMuscat reporting 
            lower than expected profits for the first quarter of 2004 and Topaz 
            Energy &amp; Marine breaking its expected acquisition deal. ONIC Holding 
            also slid down on speculations of lower than expected financial 
            results. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Industry and Banking &amp; Investment Stocks rule the roost</b> <br>
            However, with key stocks largely pertaining to the industry sector 
            still being attractive, the market rallied to break the crucial 
            309-level and was in a bullish orbit till the time OER went to 
            press. Another fundamental reason for the bullishness could be the 
            rising international oil prices, last reported to be ruling at 
            $42/barrel. <br>
            <br>
            The industry sector, led largely by infrastructure stocks including 
            cement and port companies, was the major gainer during this period. 
            Cement stocks continued their dream run from last month, with Raysut 
            and Oman Cement both gaining by 34.2% and 13%,<img border="0" src="market_snap.jpg" width="350" height="91" hspace="5" vspace="2" align="right"> respectively, during 
            the period under review. Overall, stock prices of Raysut and Oman 
            Cement have rallied by almost 58% and 43%, respectively, excluding 
            the dividend announced by the companies with both companies planning 
            to increase their capacities in the current year. <br>
            <br>
            The banking and investment sector also took part, largely on the 
            investment and holding<img border="0" src="market_snap1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="350" height="214"> companies. DIDIC flared up from around a base 
            of RO2.850 levels (post-dividend levels) to touch RO3.390. 
            BankDhofar, which had not taken part earlier amongst the banking 
            community, also rallied to touch RO3.600, a gain of around 15%, 
            while investment funds like Muscat Index, First Mazoon Fund and 
            Majan JIA also gained on back of overall improvement in the MSM 
            stock markets. <br>
            <br>
            Among the losers were companies with low liquidity like Sweets of 
            Oman and Hilton Salalah while others were companies which had 
            declared poor performance on a YoY basis like Oman Chemical, Oman 
            Chlorine, Oman National Electric and Muscat Gas. <br>
            <br>
            In a significant news, ONIC Holding saw a huge transfer of its 
            shares constituting around 17% of it capital which was bought by 
            Shuaa Capital, a UAE-based investment company from Abraaj Capital. 
            The company also mentioned its intention of looking at the Bahrain &amp; 
            other GCC markets for its insurance operations. Salalah Port 
            Services signed a $100 million (RO38.5 million) term loan with 
            BankMuscat, Gulf International Bank and Bank Dhofar. The proceeds of 
            term loan would go to refinance its existing term loan along with 
            part-financing its proposed acquisition of equipment. However, the 
            company share price dropped by around 90 baisa to RO3.810 during the 
            period under review due to dismal financial performance for the 
            first quarter ending March 2004. <br>
            <br>
            Overall, the declines overshadow the advances with 47 stocks 
            declining as against 34 stocks which gained during the period under 
            review. In general, we expect the market to continue with the 
            momentum built up over the last few days.</font></p>

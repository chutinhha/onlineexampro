                    the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) corporate broadband 
                    solution service called MaxNet in 
                    a ceremony held under the auspices of HE Juma bin Ali bin 
                    Juma, the minister of manpower. The new service is part of Omantelos quest to develop and bring in new technologies to 
                    the Sultanate and further expanding its services and 
                    products portfolio. </b><br>
                    <br>
                    The ATM is a fast packet technology that uses short 
                    fixed-length packets called cells. MaxNet is a nationwide 
                    multi-service broadband platform which allows convergence of 
                    data, voice and video services. The network will provide 
                    corporate customers with a selectable end-to-end absolute 
                    quality service for all of their connectivity requirements. 
                    As such, MaxNet deploys the latest state-of-the-art, 
                    carrier-class multi-service technology, providing an 
                    end-to-end integrated network solution that can 
                    simultaneously handle multiple types of network traffic. <br>
                    <br>
                    Three local banking giants - BankMuscat, National Bank Oman 
                    and Oman Arab Bank - signed a five-year agreement with 
                    Omantel to avail of the new service that mainly targets 
                    corporate organisations from both public and private 
                    sectors. <br>
                    <br>
                    In his speech, Eng. Mohammed bin Ali Al Wohaibi, executive 
                    president of Omantel, stated that MaxNet is considered as 
                    one of the most sophisticated services in the 
                    telecommunications field worldwide adding that the ATM 
                    launch is a pivotal step that would provide momentum to the 
                    services sector, including health, banking and trade 
                    sectors. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Omantel is moving from being just a basic telecom service 
                    provider to complete package solutions and value-added 
                    service provider with keen focus on quality and speed. It is 
                    Omantelos keen intention to strike a full-fledged 
                    partnership with both public and private sector 
                    organisations and further enhance the productivity and 
                    efficiency level of the technological operations,' added Al 
                    Wohaibi. The Omantel chief indicated that the launch of 
                    MaxNet fell within the companyos strategy aimed at bringing 
                    about a comprehensive reshuffle of the companyos services 
                    and products portfolio. They, he said, are launching a new 
                    generation of the complete services that enable the 
                    corporate community to handle their multiple types of 
                    network traffic easily, safely and in cost effective manner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Al Wohaibi stressed that the MaxNet service was a 
                    revolutionary technology that would open up a world of 
                    possibilities for corporate customers and their networks 
                    that was not possible with todayos leased-line service 
                    adding the initiative, driven by market demand, is one of 
                    many steps taken by Omantel to build the telemedicine, 
                    e-government infrastructure and ultimately reaching the 
                    full-fledged digital community in a way that would further 
                    nudge the progress of the comprehensive development in the 
                    Sultanate. <br>
                    <br>
                    The ATM Broadband Solution provides corporate customers with 
                    the flexibility required to build any type of network 
                    solution (e.g. Virtual Private Networks, Virtual Lease Line, 
                    and Transparent LAN) and has ultimate scalability as it does 
                    not impose any speed limitations. <br>
                    <br>
                    It is that flexibility that ATM Broadband Solution allows 
                    corporate customers to design their communication needs 
                    around the requirements of their businesses and their 
                    business applications. Building end-to-end integrated 
                    networks with an end-end selectable quality of service will 
                    become a commodity. <br>

                    <b>Wohaibi elected deputy chairman of Arab Group </b><br>
                    <br>
                    Last month, Eng Mohammed bin Ali Al Wohaibi, executive 
                    president of Oman Telecommunications Company, was elected as 
                    the deputy chairman of the Arab Regional Group and chairman 
                    of the affiliated Infrastructure Investment and Services 
                    Group in a fresh recognition of Omantelos successful and 
                    interactive involvement in various international forums. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Arab Regional Group for the Private Sector was formed by 
                    and falls within the International Telecommunications 
                    Unionos attention paid to the private sectoros activities in 
                    the provincial regions. The Arab Regional Group for the 
                    Private Sector is chaired by Othman Sultan, executive 
                    president of Mobinil Company with six sub-groups affiliated 
                    from this group namely, Telecommunications Affairs 
                    Regulatory Group, Women and Youth Affairs Group, Human 
                    Strength-Building Group, International Summit Group of the 
                    Informatics Community, the Lesser Advanced Countries Group 
                    and the Infrastructure Investment and Services Group. The 
                    latter sub-group is chaired by Al Wohaibi. <br>

                    <b>TRA introduces 8-digit phone numbers</b><br>
                    <br>
                    The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) has 
                    announced the implementation of a new numbering plan for 
                    various public telecom services provided at present by 
                    Omantel, namely fixed lines, GSM and prepaid services. The 
                    implementation of the new plan will result in changing the 
                    numbers used by the subscribers. <br>
                    <br>
                    The numbering plan is a national resource with finite 
                    capacity. With the potential for the future introduction of 
                    competition into the sector, it is a requirement that all 
                    future operators have equivalent access to the numbering 
                    resources and that they can receive allocations from within 
                    the appropriate plan. <br>
                    <br>
                    The existing national numbering plan is critically short of 
                    capacity and requires reform. The changes adopted within the 
                    plan to implement eight-digit numbering scheme has been 
                    designed to create both additional capacity and to ensure, 
                    as far as possible, flexibility to allow unhindered 
                    development of the national numbering plan in the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, TRA responsibilities are to ensure that adequate 
                    numbers are available for all telecommunications services 
                    throughout the Sultanate. The existing numbering plan is a 
                    six-digit (exceptionally, seven digits) scheme. It is 
                    running short of capacity and suffering from a range of 
                    problems such as: <br>

                    TRA with the consultation of Omantel and international 
                    consultancy companies supports the introduction of the eight 
                    digits scheme for the following reasons: <br>

                    <br>
                    The key role of the TRA, which was established by a Royal 
                    Decree, is to ensure provision of telecommunications 
                    services throughout the Sultanate at reasonable prices and 
                    encourage the penetration of various telecommunication 
                    services as well as laying grounds and setting sound 
                    conditions for the competition. This is achieved by bringing 
                    in more operators in the Sultanate and increasing 
                    availability of services in kind and quality in accordance 
                    with international trends. <br>

                    <b>Oman Awards for Excellence presented</b><br>
                    <br>
                    The Oman Awards for Excellence 2003 were presented last 
                    month at the Al Bustan Palace hotel in Muscat, recognising 
                    the hard work and toil of 23 equally competitive 
                    organisations, and honouring the cream among them with the 
                    coveted awards. <br>
                    <br>
                    Attended by a large gathering of corporate leaders, CEOs and 
                    the cream of Oman's private sector, the Oman Awards for 
                    Excellence 2003 was one memorable event that kept the 
                    audience glued to their seats throughout the four hours of 
                    the show held at the Al Bustan Palace Hotel. <br>
                    <br>
                    The event to honour this year's recipients was kicked off 
                    with Azzan Al Busaidi, economic researcher, OCIPED, 
                    welcoming the distinguished guests. Philip Stanton, partner, 
                    Ernst &amp; Young formally introduced the Oman Awards for 
                    Excellence 2003 with a witty presentation, followed by some 
                    interesting anecdotes from the the keynote speaker for the 
                    evening, James Hogan, CEO, Gulf Air. The theme for this 
                    year's awards was ÒGet ready to cross the frontiers of 
                    excellence' and the highlight of the evening was a dummy 
                    rocket actually taking off from the stage. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Oman Awards for Excellence is an annual award programme 
                    established in 1998 and developed by the private sector to 
                    mark Oman's first ÔYear of the Private Sector' with two 
                    categories, which has now grown to seven. The programme 
                    seeks to celebrate the accomplishments of individuals, 
                    companies and other contributors who create jobs and drive 
                    the Omani economy. <br>
                    <br>
                    The competition had significantly increased this year in 
                    each of the award categories. A new category ÔPeople 
                    Development Award' was introduced for the year for 
                    organisations with forward-thinking workforce development 
                    strategies. Profiles of each finalist shown at the awards 
                    ceremony reflected how well organised and well prepared each 
                    of them was. It must have been a tough decision for the 
                    judges as all finalists revealed closely matched results.

                    In a bid to establish a competitive power sector and to 
                    further speed up the privatisation process, Oman has floated 
                    a holding company, named Electricity Holding Company. ÒThe 
                    comprehensive privatisation programme of the sector, 
                    involving setting up of independent power companies on a 
                    commercial basis, is well advanced. The final draft of a law 
                    that will regulate the power sector is ready, and policies 
                    and procedures are underway to finalise and promulgate the 
                    law,' sources at the Ministry of National Economy said last

                    are several questions that people want answered when we talk 
                    about the future. The key forecast revolves around the 
                    strength of the US economy, the largest in the world. It has 
                    achieved an 8.2 per cent annualised growth rate in 2003. 
                    However, when you take a look at how the dollar and fixed 
                    income markets are trading, you will notice that it's not 
                    just about GDP. Politics and interventions among other 
                    factors also require consideration. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Interest rates:</b> Long-term interest rates in the US 
                    appear to be stable and look set to remain low although 
                    rising. In the short term, there probably will not be an 
                    interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The Fed could 
                    raise rates but this will be limited. In the Eurozone there 
                    is still the possibility they could cut rates. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Equity &amp; Bonds:</b> Equity markets continue to look 
                    unsavoury so look out for a yield pick-up in bonds although 
                    the credit of some companies could perform quite well also. 
                    Generally speaking, equities still look expensive. Some 
                    companies will outperform in 2004 but the hunt for them is a 
                    risky business. When the dollar falls, US equities may rise 
                    slightly and outperform the rest of the world but, from an 
                    asset allocation point of view, other alternatives are 
                    looking good for your money. However, this is not the 
                    beginning of a bear market for US bonds. Although investors 
                    may continue to pull back from equities into fixed 
                    instruments, the bond market is not reacting as it normally 
                    would because of other market dynamics. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The US dollar:</b> This could be the beginning of a 
                    dollar bear market. This is not a weak dollar; this is a 
                    weakening dollar. Hence, the next phase of a 'weak' dollar 
                    is yet to materialise. The currency has moved from a 
                    position of being over-valued dollar to becoming 
                    fair-valued. US growth has been stimulated by tax cuts, 
                    mortgage refinancing because of the low cost of capital, and 
                    auto incentives to boost retail sales. However, there are 
                    long-term concerns: excess capacity, high levels of debt, 
                    poor retained earnings, and undershooting inflation. Don't 
                    be fooled by the cyclical upswing in the US economy. It is 
                    receiving a boost from monetary and fiscal policies but 
                    underlying its appearance fundamental problems continue to 
                    exist. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Retail sales in the US:</b> Consumer spending in the US 
                    has been very strong. There has been some softening lately. 
                    This is not surprising as once the tax cuts have been spent 
                    retail sales seemingly diminish. In addition, strong auto 
                    sales derived from price cuts and interest free credit can 
                    be a misleading indicator of growth. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Productivity in the US:</b> While strong growth in the US 
                    economy has not created inflation, it has not brought about 
                    'super-normal' profits either. Just because auto sales have 
                    been strong does not mean auto companies have done well - 
                    incentives and massive excess capacity and lack of pricing 
                    power means strong growth did not translate into superior 
                    returns. Higher industrial output has also meant that fewer 
                    people are needed to produce the same number of goods and 
                    services as before. The resulting unemployment and lower 
                    inflation (from less spending power in the market) could be 
                    a worry for US president Bush as he seeks re-election in 
                    2004. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>US growth:</b> The Federal Reserve is looking for 4.25 
                    per cent growth in the US economy although it looks set to 
                    grow less than this level. The dollar will probably continue 
                    to fall and bonds are going to stay at around the same 
                    level. The US expects that its growth in 2003 will outstrip 
                    that of the other G6 economies by the biggest margin since 
                    the 1960s. If the differential becomes this large, the US 
                    will have a smaller market for its exports and it will suck 
                    in imports. Such economic growth, therefore, is 
                    unsustainable. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>US current account:</b> According to the IMF there have 
                    only been 12 previous occasions when countries have run a 
                    deficit of more than 4 per cent of GDP for 3 years. It would 
                    take a further 20 per cent depreciation in the dollar trade 
                    weighted index next year, in order to narrow the current 
                    account deficit rate by 1.5 per cent by 2006. <br>
                    <br>
                    The US has been financing its current account deficit 
                    through direct investment (the buying and selling of 
                    companies) and portfolio investment (the buying of US 
                    equities and bonds). There has been much less M&amp;A activity 
                    recently meaning all the financing is being derived from 
                    portfolio investment. However, it is becoming less 
                    attractive for international private investors to seize 
                    investment opportunities in the US when superior rates of 
                    return are no longer on offer. <b><br>
                    <br>
                    What's stopping a big $ fall?:</b> Well, 40 per cent of US 
                    net portfolio flows are coming from Asia. Moreover, central 
                    banks in the world, particularly in Asia, are propping the 
                    dollar up so that their own markets do not weaken. <br>
                    <br>
                    For example, the Bank of Japan is trying to maximise 
                    economic growth in its country by building over $150 billion 
                    dollars of foreign currency reserves in 2003. Such 
                    interventions are distorting economies to keep the 
                    relationship they have with the dollar unchanged and 
                    preventing the dollar from depreciating to its real value. 
                    The dollar is headed lower against the euro also against the 
                    yen. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Gold is a sound bet:</b> Gold and precious metals should 
                    do well in the near future. You cannot debase it, it is 
                    protected against political risk premium rising, and you can 
                    now buy gold bullion securities in some markets with issued 
                    certificates of ownership for a particular quantity.</font></p>

            Construction is such a lucrative industry in Oman that it would be 
            foolhardy to overlook its importance. The most pressing issue facing 
            the industry is that of cost control on construction projects,

                    of Oman's infrastructure and buildings have been designed 
                    and constructed over the past 30 years. To put it into 
                    perspective for example, in 1970 there were three schools 
                    with a total of 909 students, there were only 10km of paved 
                    roads and about 1,700km of unpaved tracks, there was only 
                    one small hospital with unreliable electricity and there was 
                    no seaports. There are now 1,022 schools including private 
                    schools with a total of 601,166 students, one Government 
                    university, private universities and many colleges, there 
                    are over 10,000km of paved roads and about 25,300km of 
                    unpaved track, there are 51 hospitals and 129 health centres 
                    all over the country and two major seaports. <br>
                    <br>
                    The development of the construction industry is often an 
                    overlooked cornerstone to ensuring progress in Oman and 
                    therefore examining all aspects and factors of success 
                    should contribute to its improvement. The issues of cost 
                    control of construction projects are certainly becoming 
                    important aspects in the daily procedures for allocating 
                    budgets and approving projects for execution. This 
                    unfortunately will continue to dominate the way decisions 
                    for initial approvals are made in future projects. It is a 
                    well-known fact that lowest prices are not necessarily best 
                    bids and yet most of our decisions are still based on lowest 
                    cost. <br>
                    <br>
                    In Oman, the issues of quality, reliability and durability 
                    of construction projects are still treated as of vital 
                    importance in determining the success of a project. Despite 
                    what others might suggest, a more balanced approach is 
                    needed in the construction industry to achieve these issues 
                    hand in hand with cost control. <br>
                    <br>
                    The year 2003 witnessed a lot of development projects in the 
                    public sector as well as private sectors. The private sector 
                    is now taking a more active role in the development of the 
                    infrastructure in Oman. This trend is likely to take us 
                    through 2004 and well beyond. Privatisation and development 
                    of telecom, electricity, water sectors and wastewater system 
                    is a clear indication that Government is serious in pursuing 
                    the policy to diversify the economy and encourage the 
                    private sector. <br>
                    <br>
                    Unexpectedly, after a general drop in 1999-2002, the cost of 
                    construction materials climbed in 2003, especially on steel 
                    and cement. Following the current trend on prices of 
                    material, we are likely to see further increases in the 
                    prices of local cement and imported steel in 2004. If the 
                    value of Euro continues to go up on the other hand, the cost 
                    of construction plants, machinery and spare parts from 
                    Europe is most likely to follow suit as well. Other local 
                    materials and materials from Asia are expected to remain at 
                    the same levels if not slightly lower due to the 
                    availability and local competition. <br>
                    <br>
                    Housing is another major area of the construction boom. The 
                    standard of housing is a reflection of the standard of 
                    living of a country and the well being of its people. 
                    Housing has been and still is the top priority of the 
                    Government. Modern tenants in Oman are now forced to make 
                    the choice of moving to new properties simply because the 
                    building owners have failed to meet their requirements, 
                    whether in general maintenance, poor design, lack of 
                    improvement of the old properties. <br>
                    <br>
                    A few of these building owners are selling their residential 
                    properties as they have long since ceased to be profitable. 
                    They are utilising the funds to provide better standard of 
                    housing for their tenants. The temporary halt by concern 
                    Ministry to give permission to build flats on small housing 
                    lands is likely to reduce the construction work of flats in 
                    this sector. As a result, construction work of flats in 
                    commercial plots is likely to improve. In 2003, the 
                    consulting professions have been busy designing commercial 
                    and residential block. However, the signs are promising. <br>
                    <br>
                    A turning point has been reached. The country is now 
                    experiencing an increase in expenditure resulting from the 
                    cost of operating and maintaining the structures of 
                    previously constructed projects. For this reason the 
                    construction client and building owners in Oman should now 
                    attempt to do a proper life appraisal of all its future 
                    projects. <br>
                    <br>
                    The commitments of all future costs should be estimated as 
                    accurately as possible and as early as possible before any 
                    decisions are taken. The question in our future projects, 
                    should not be only on the construction cost or on whether 
                    the project should proceed or not, but it should be 
                    addressed more to what will be the total costs of projects 
                    after taking into account all the running and maintenance 
                    costs of such a project. <br>
                    <br>
                    Successful property investors should seek to understand the 
                    economic and social forces that shape our environment. They 
                    must know the needs of the tenants as a whole. They should 
                    also target category of the tenant they are interested in, 
                    and select preferred locations for the project, then design 
                    to meet their needs. The most common mistake made by 
                    investors is rushing on an investment project without proper 
                    studies. Increasing building costs on the other hand may 
                    cause projected buildings fail to meet the criteria for 
                    investment or cause rents to reach levels which tenants 
                    cannot afford to pay.</font></p>

            in there are some strong signals that the worst is over. There are

                    <img border="0" src="cover3.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="180" height="211">The 
                    aviation industry went through its worst 3 years since its 
                    existence. It started with the world economic recession in 
                    2000 caused initially by the burst of the dotcom industry, 
                    followed by the events of 9/11, then the war in Afghanistan, 
                    then in 2003 the war in Iraq and finally the SARS epidemic. 
                    Aside from a sharp drop in traffic demand, the industry was 
                    faced with a significant increase in insurance costs and 
                    fuel rates. With few exceptions, all airlines incurred 
                    losses during this period. Major staff layoffs took place, 
                    aircraft orders were cancelled or deferred, some aircraft 
                    were parked, some airlines actually disappeared and others 
                    declared bankruptcies and sought protection from creditors 
                    to re-organise. <br>
                    <br>
                    In mid-2003, with the end of the SARS epidemic, there were 
                    signs of recovery with airlines experiencing double digit 
                    growth rates; albeit from a reduced base in 2002 which 
                    itself was lower than 2001. Although the traffic growth is 
                    encouraging, prices remain depressed due to surplus 
                    capacities in the marketplace and the still lagging business 
                    travel market which normally offers higher fares than 
                    leisure travel. <br>
                    <br>
                    Closer to home, the Gulf region has witnessed some 
                    significant developments. Gulf Air seems to be regaining 
                    their health following the injection of additional capital 
                    by their Owner States and coupled with aggressive marketing 
                    and network expansion. Emirates Airlines continued their 
                    impressive network and fleet expansion and were the launch 
                    customers for two ultra modern aircraft: the super jumbo 
                    Airbus 380 and the ultra long range Airbus A340-500. Qatar 
                    Airways also announced a major network and fleet expansion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another recent interesting development is the establishment 
                    of two new airlines: the Sharjah based Air Arabia and the 
                    Abu Dhabi based Al Etihad. While both are 100 per cent 
                    government owned, the former is a low cost/low fare airline 
                    (the first in the region) and the latter a full service 
                    airline. There are talks of establishing one or two more low 
                    cost/low fare airlines - Trans Gulf and possible Mena Jet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are several implications from this development:<br>
                    1) There will be a wider choice for consumers. <br>
                    2) Consumers will benefit from the resultant lower prices 
                    from increased competition. <br>
                    3) There will be increased competition between air travel 
                    and ground transportation. <br>
                    4) Lower prices will most likely result in increased demand 
                    as was the case in USA and Europe. <br>
                    5) Airports in the region will benefit from the increased 
                    activities. <br>
                    6) There will be increased polarisation with airlines in the 
                    region as each seeks to achieve a sustainable competitive 
                    advantage; those who'll focus on intercontinental 
                    operations, and others who'll specialise on low prices, etc. 
                    Airlines will focus on providing value for their chosen 
                    market segments. <br>
                    <br>
                    Given the limited population in much of the Gulf region 
                    (Oman, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain which combined have a 
                    population of only 6 million), of which a significant 
                    portion is made up of low income blue collar workers, the 
                    challenge for growth will be access to markets with dense 
                    population and markets with relatively high disposal income. 
                    For example, the Indian Subcontinent on one hand and each of 
                    Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the other. Historically, it has 
                    been very difficult to acquire additional flying rights to 
                    these countries. <br>
                    <br>
                    The other important issue is whether there will be a level 
                    playing field for the competing airlines. It wouldn't be 
                    fair for some airlines that operate on a commercial basis to 
                    find themselves competing with airlines that are 
                    continuously being subsidised by the state and are thus able 
                    to dump their prices to uneconomical levels thus spoiling 
                    the market for everyone else. <br>
                    <br>
                    As far as Oman Air is concerned, on one hand it will benefit 
                    from additional activities at Seeb International Airport by 
                    earning higher revenues from handling other airlines' 
                    flights. On the other hand, it will no doubt face increased 
                    competition on markets it serves. Oman Air intends to face 
                    this threat by focusing on the niche markets that it has 
                    identified, serve such markets well with high frequencies 
                    and non-stop services, focus on satisfying the needs of the 
                    discerning business traveller and concurrently maximise 
                    efforts to develop the leisure market through the promotion 
                    of value added products such as tour packages, stopover 
                    packages and weekend fares. <br>
                    <br>
                    The company's focus on developing inbound tourism to the 
                    country has yielded encouraging results. From humble 
                    beginnings, Oman Air is now selling 600 packages a month 
                    into Oman. With the expected stability in the region, this 
                    figure is expected to triple in 2004. To offer visitors into 
                    Oman a wide choice of places to visit, Oman Air has linked 
                    both Salalah and Khasab with Dubai. Tourists can visit two 
                    or three destinations in Oman with very little incremental 
                    cost when compared to visiting just one location. <br>
                    <br>
                    For 2004, Oman Air intends to expand its network in the GCC 
                    and in the Indian Subcontinent. Moreover, a strategic 
                    alliance will be formed with one of the Gulf-based carriers 
                    opening new horizons for the airline.</font></p>

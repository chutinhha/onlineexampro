                    through birth, Omani by choice, lawyer by qualification, 
                    insurer by accident and successful through hard work - that, 
                    in a nutshell, is the story of Taher Bin Taleb Kamal Al 
                    Heraki, the CEO of Dhofar Insurance Co. SAOG. Born in 1946 
                    in Al Maraa in Syria, Heraki took up Omani citizenship three 
                    years ago after spending about a quarter of a century in the 
                    Sultanate because he loves Oman and believes that it is a 
                    &quot;great country.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Coming as he does from a family of Syrian landlords, Heraki 
                    spent his childhood years mainly in Lebanon and Syria. In 
                    his own words, Heraki belongs to a &quot;large and very warm 
                    family.&quot; He has some rather fond childhood memories and was 
                    very close to his father, who expired recently at the age of 
                    92. A family man at heart, he maintains a close bondage with 
                    his four brothers and three sisters even today, and meets 
                    them at least once a year. <br>
                    <br>
                    Heraki received his basic education in Lebanon and completed 
                    his further education in Syria, Kuwait, Beirut and Europe. 
                    An extremely well educated individual, Heraki graduated in 
                    Law from one of the best universities in Damascus, Syria, 
                    and completed a host of courses from Europe and the UK, 
                    including one from the Chartered Insurance Institute in 
                    Kent, London. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Career cover </b><br>
                    Beginning his career in London in the early 1960s, Heraki 
                    moved to Gulf Insurance Company (GIC) in Kuwait after 
                    serving approximately three years in military service in 
                    Syria. &quot;I came to Kuwait in 1973 because things were 
                    changing in Syria and the conditions there weren't very 
                    healthy,&quot; he insists. &quot;I came into the insurance business by 
                    accident,&quot; he adds with a twinkle in his eyes. An accident 
                    he certainly doesn't mind. For, he is today at the helm of 
                    affairs of the leading insurance company in Oman.<br>
                    <br>
                    It wasn't smooth sailing all the way, though. From his 
                    humble beginnings as an insurance salesman with the Fire and 
                    General Accident department of GIC, one of the successful 
                    insurance companies in the Middle East, Heraki worked hard 
                    to climb the organisational ladder before he was given the 
                    opportunity to handle branches outside Kuwait. He completed 
                    an array of professional courses while on the job and, 
                    slowly but surely, progressed in his career, becoming the 
                    branch manager of GIC Kuwait, resident manager of GIC Oman 
                    and then the regional manager for GIC Oman and Abu Dhabi.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although he has been in Oman since 1976, Heraki's biggest 
                    jump in career came about in September 1989, when Dhofar 
                    Insurance Company was established as an Omani joint stock 
                    company and the portfolios of the GIC &amp; the Sudan Insurance 
                    Company were merged into it, and he was appointed as the new 
                    company's general manager. &quot;We started with a premium of 
                    RO3.5 million at the end of 1990,&quot; reminisces Heraki, &quot;and 
                    today, we will be in-shah-Allah closing the year with RO38 
                    million.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Not surprisingly, Dhofar Insurance - which began operations 
                    with the Oman portfolio of GIC and Sudan Insurance and a 
                    staff strength of six-seven people working from a small 
                    office in Ruwi - has today grown into one of the top 
                    insurance companies in Oman with a 250-strong workforce and 
                    an enviable branch network of 25 offices across the country. 
                    Keeping pace with the company's growth, Heraki became a 
                    member of Dhofar Insurance's board of directors five years 
                    ago and was promoted as its CEO in the beginning of last 
                    year. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Indemnifying success</b><br>
                    Heraki attributes the company's success to its staff, who 
                    worked very hard to make the company reach the leadership 
                    position that it has attained today. &quot;It is as a team that 
                    we work, and as a team that we achieve the results,&quot; he 
                    asserts. &quot;We had to strive hard to reach where we are now,&quot; 
                    he adds. As he himself acknowledges, there were more than 
                    just a few hurdles on the path. &quot;The challenges were many - 
                    setting up a national insurance company meant not only 
                    establishing the reputation of the new company, but we also 
                    had to secure good re-insurance back-up and arrange our 
                    re-insurance treaties with leading international 
                    re-insurers,&quot; explains Heraki. <br>
                    <br>
                    This necessitated establishing a good working relationship 
                    in Europe, especially in London, Paris and Munich, the 
                    hotbed of international insurance activity. That, obviously, 
                    wasn't a mean task considering the fact that the Omani 
                    market was still in its formative years, and the country's 
                    insurance companies, barring ONIC, which had the lion's 
                    share of the market, were not considered serious competition 
                    at that time. &quot;First of all, we had to establish our name in 
                    the market, build up a good client base and go ahead from 
                    there on. Almost all the major insurance accounts were tied 
                    with one insurance company or the other, and it was no 
                    cakewalk for us,&quot; he claims.<br>
                    <br>
                    The success formula that Heraki and his team hit upon was 
                    ostensibly simple - stay close to your client. &quot;Since 
                    service is the key in our business, we began operations with 
                    a direct marketing approach and set up our own branch 
                    offices and marketing team rather than go in for business 
                    through appointing agencies and going through 
                    intermediaries,&quot; explains Heraki. While there was always 
                    &quot;the pressure to accept business through one or the other&quot; 
                    intermediary, Dhofar Insurance, however, stuck to its belief 
                    of staying close to the customer, and the results are there 
                    for all to see. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Management policy </b><br>
                    &quot;I believe in an open door policy, and interact closely with 
                    all my staff alike - from the office boy to the senior 
                    management, everyone will tell you that I am accessible to 
                    them at all times,&quot; states Heraki. &quot;The strength of any 
                    organisation comes from its human resources, and we should 
                    never forget that,&quot; he cautions. Leading by example, he 
                    never leaves office till he has cleared &quot;every single paper&quot; 
                    from his table. <br>
                    <br>
                    A firm believer in the benefits of teamwork, Heraki is a 
                    true team player. &quot;As far as routine tasks are concerned, 
                    they are, indeed, delegated to the management team. Each 
                    manager is responsible to run his department and we meet as 
                    often as possible to see what the shortcomings are and what 
                    improvements are to be made, if required. There are 
                    management meetings at least once a week and we recapitulate 
                    on the progress/ setbacks over the period and discuss the 
                    course of action&quot;. <br>
                    <br>
                    At the same time, Heraki maintains management focus by 
                    retaining close ties with the clients. For, &quot;insurance means 
                    trust,&quot; he says. And it is that trust that he has been 
                    maintaining for over 25 years and wants to do so for a long 
                    time to come by giving his &quot;100 per cent energy.&quot;</font></p>

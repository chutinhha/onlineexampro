                    and robust growth in the Sultanate in the last 
                    decade-and-a-half from a nascent beginning in 1987. The 
                    industry today has six strong players well entrenched in the 
                    business. Their cumulative net worth is in excess of $110 
                    million (RO42.31 million) and assets under financing exceed 
                    half a billion US dollars (RO192.31 million). The industry, 
                    which showed continuous growth for about a 
                    decade-and-a-half, is now at the consolidation stages. 
                    Assets growth is recording sustainable matured growth rates.

                    <p align="justify">
                    <font face="Verdana" size="1">The industry, since its inception, has grown at a very rapid 
                    pace, maintaining the strong growth up to 2001, recording 
                    compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) in excess of 25 per 
                    cent. The growth was largely due to a shift in the financing 
                    patterns in the country. As more and more leasing companies 
                    made their debuts, these new entities had both the resources 
                    and the appetite for more business. Thus, this growth was 
                    largely fuelled by business moving into an organised leasing 
                    sector as distinguished from the hitherto vendor financing. 
                    In 1997, two new leasing entities made a debut with a 
                    combined capital of RO10 million and a lending capacity of 
                    about RO40-50 million. There have been no new entrants since 
                    then. <br>
                    <br>
                    As balance-sheet capacities filled up, the growth tapered 
                    off with actually a negative growth in 2002 for the industry 
                    as a whole. This also reflected the maturity phase of the 
                    existing leasing capacities created and the overall nature 
                    of lease financing which, by definition, is a 
                    self-liquidating instrument of finance, where the attrition 
                    in assets will be by and large net off the new business 
                    underwritten and growth equating that of the country's 
                    economy in general. Today, the leasing and hire purchase 
                    financing is well accepted by the people and is a preferred 
                    source of financing especially in automobiles and white 
                    goods. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Macro &amp; Micro Economics </b><br>
                    The broad Macro Economic factors are expected to remain 
                    positive over the year 2004 in the region. The reverse 
                    capital inflows into the region are expected to taper off 
                    with both US economy and dollar rates showing bullish 
                    trends. However, Oman will benefit from the trickle of 
                    reverse capital inflows from within the region as well as 
                    directly. This should keep the MSM bullish. <br>
                    With expected growth in the US economy and Fed signalling 
                    steady to marginal increase in the dollar rates, this is 
                    expected to substantially arrest the rapid decline in the 
                    value of the dollar. Automobiles, the largest private sector 
                    segment, saw a decline in 2003. The sector should emerge 
                    strongly in 2004 and show healthy growth on the back of 
                    steady yen and Euro vis-à-vis the US dollar and continuing 
                    low interest rates. The Rial Omani interest rates should by 
                    and large be steady and move within a narrow range. The oil 
                    revenue is expected to remain steady during the year. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Crystal Gazing</b><br>
                    With companies creating more capacities through capital 
                    expansion and automated system and processes, the industry 
                    should see a new phase of growth in the next few years. 
                    Residual vendor financing would further migrate to the 
                    organised leasing sector. The growth in the next two years 
                    will continue to reflect a matured phase, at 3 and 5 per 
                    cent (CAGR), as companies will take time to reposition 
                    themselves and deploy new capacities created. <br>
                    However, the leasing industry is poised for a substantially 
                    higher growth in the immediate future. Not necessarily the 
                    next 2 years, but in the next 5 years, we hope to see 
                    substantially higher growth rates as compared to the growth 
                    in the economy or in GDP. The reasons for it are as follows:
                    <br>
                    1. The total assets under lease financing are under 3 per 
                    cent of GDP. This is much lower than the industry average 
                    worldwide. The potential for growth is, therefore, very 
                    high. <br>
                    2. More specialised lease service providers are expected to 
                    emerge viz. operating leases and off-balance-sheet products.
                    <br>
                    3. It is expected that some of the major banks may soon look 
                    at big ticket leasing both to increase their product and 
                    service range and boost earnings and deploy the excess 
                    liquidity. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Conclusion </b><br>
                    In the final analysis, 2004 should post a healthy growth, 
                    with continuing trickle of capital inflows, steady oil 
                    revenues and, by and large, stable Rial Omani interest rates 
                    benefiting the automobiles, banking, leasing and real estate 
                    sectors. Real estate is expected to benefit in spite of low 
                    occupancies thanks to increasing liquidity (rise in money 
                    supply) and low return on bank deposits set to continue in 
                    2004. The retail and capital goods sectors should also 
                    benefit from the trickle down effect. <br>
                    With increasing levels of awareness and a rapid increase in 
                    the knowledge base of the customers, today a sophisticated 
                    customer demands genuine value and greater product 
                    differentiation, forcing lease providers and other market 
                    players to innovate, brand and position their products to 
                    remain competitive and relevant in the fiercely competitive 
                    new marketplace.</font></p>

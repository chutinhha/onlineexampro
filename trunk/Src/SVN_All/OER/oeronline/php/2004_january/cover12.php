            largely to attractive oil prices, the year 2004 will be a difficult 
            year in terms of production. Gas, on the other hand, is doing well

                    has had a very good 2003 in terms of oil prices. The year 
                    was good as a whole for the region barring some unfortunate 
                    political upheaval. From business point of view, it was an 
                    excellent year, not just for Oman, but also for our 
                    neighbours. We have managed to achieve our target levels of 
                    oil production in 2003 (703,000 barrels per day), and we 
                    expect to meet the targets in 2004 as well, which have been 
                    set at 650,000 barrels per day for Petroleum Development 
                    Oman (PDO) and 100,000 bpd for other small producers and 
                    NGLs (total: 750,000 bpd). <br>
                    <br>
                    There were new multinational companies that signed 
                    concession agreements with the government in 2003, and we 
                    are hopeful that they will be successful. A large number of 
                    healthy exploration activities are being undertaken by a lot 
                    of companies in Oman, including PDO. Technology plays a 
                    major role in the sector, and things are getting better all 
                    the time. However, it will be a mistake for us to put our 
                    future on future technology, something which has not been 
                    yet unveiled and, thus, might not happen at all. Our plans 
                    for the future are based on what we know today. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the past, I have gone on record saying that Oman's oil 
                    wealth will last for the next 50 years, and I said that five 
                    years ago. So, if I stick to my words, which I do, I believe 
                    Oman's oil production will last us for another 45 years or 
                    thereabouts. <br>
                    <br>
                    Of course, we will succeed in producing more, extending the 
                    life of the fields through the use of new technology. I am 
                    hopeful that, as trends suggest, new, better and more 
                    efficient ways of drilling oil in a more economical manner 
                    will be discovered in the future. However, even if we do not 
                    stumble upon such ways, I'm not worried because, even 
                    through the current technology, Oman's oil wealth is going 
                    to last for a long time to come.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moreover, the gas segment is doing exceedingly well, and we 
                    are continuing with LNG expansion plans. The Liquefied 
                    Natural Gas (LNG) train project at Qalhat, Sur, is 
                    progressing ahead of schedule. The first quarter of 2004 
                    will witness the conclusion of LNG sales agreement, and we 
                    hope to be in a strong position to obtain financing for this 
                    project. As you are aware, at present this project is being 
                    financed by the government, but we are hopeful of getting it 
                    financed by the banks and financial institutions early this 
                    year. <br>
                    <br>
                    Simultaneously, other plans, recently disclosed by PDO, will 
                    be executed in 2004. Work has already begun in the Harweel 
                    cluster of fields in south Oman, and it is expected to go on 
                    stream this year. We have also started, although on a small 
                    scale, the development of heavy oil fields in Mukhaizna, and 
                    I believe that there is a lot of potential there and am 
                    excited at the prospect. Other activities that 2004 will 
                    witness are the projects related to QLNG and Sohar Refinery, 
                    which will intensify during the year. <br>
                    <br>
                    The year 2004 will be a difficult year in terms of 
                    production, and when I say that, I imply that it will be 
                    difficult for PDO to match up the production levels of the 
                    previous years. Having said that, however, let me also tell 
                    you that we now understand the reasons behind the decline in 
                    output levels, and are working towards resolving those 
                    issues. Moreover, the high oil price in 2003 gave us relief 
                    from the decline in production. <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm optimistic that all signs indicate that oil prices will 
                    not go down too much from their 2003 levels. They will, 
                    perhaps, drop by 2 or 3 dollars. Fundamentals suggest that 
                    they will stay in the $24-26 per barrel band. And this 
                    figure is based on IMF's consumer and producer statistics 
                    forecast. Of course, to beat or even equal the performance 
                    of 2003 in 2004 will be quite a challenge. If we are able to 
                    do that, I'll be very happy. We will, indeed, give it our 
                    best shot as we always strive to better our performance with 
                    each passing year. We did have a bit of luck in 2003 as far 
                    as oil prices are concerned, but we also achieved a lot, 
                    like the QLNG and Sohar Refinery projects through hard work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We are also on the lookout for new markets for our gas. Oman 
                    is keen to look into the Indian market as it is closer to 
                    home. Transportation is a major cost element in LNG 
                    business. The Indian market suits both India and Oman as 
                    transportation costs are lesser. On the other hand, there 
                    are high transportation costs of exporting Omani gas to 
                    Japan or the US. That is not to say that we are not looking 
                    at these markets. We are also looking at the Far East - 
                    Japan, Korea and China. The US is also emerging as a large 
                    consumer of gas. <br>
                    <br>
                    While there obviously may not be any new LNG or refinery 
                    projects in 2004 of the scale that were initiated in 2003, 
                    we are hopeful that there will be new projects for enhancing 
                    oil production and exploration. I look at 2004 and 2005 as a 
                    time to consolidate the gains made in 2003 and expect the 
                    New Year to be an extremely busy one from activity point of 
                    view.</font></p>

<b>Intel produces chip with 2 ‘brains’</b><br>
Intel, the world’s largest microchip maker, has announced that it has completed 
the initial production runs of a chip with two processors-in-one, setting the 
stage for mainstream marketing of personal computers with two processor 
‘brains.’ Intel will add two so-called dual-core products to its Pentium family 
of chips during Q2, including the Pentium processor Extreme Edition, said a 
statement. <br>
<br>
Intel’s Pentium Extreme Edition will also include hyper-threading technology – a 
separate technology Intel began offering three years ago. With hyper-threading 
and dual cores, Intel chips can process four software calculations 
simultaneously by efficiently using resources that otherwise would sit idle. 
Intel’s announcement comes after the consortium of Sony, IBM and Toshiba 
announced details of their ‘Cell’ processor based on similar so-called 
‘multi-core’ technology.</font></p>

<b>And now, e-Parking!</b><br>
Cyber Gear has developed an online application that allows people to reserve a 
parking space using the Internet. According to Sharad Agarwal, CEO of Cyber 
Gear, ‘‘We built the application after studying the traffic and parking related 
problems of a growing city such as Dubai. The e-Parking engine allows the 
management and owners of car parks to configure the parking lot on their 
Website. Visitors to shopping malls, exhibition and event venues can view the 
available slots and reserve online. There is even a credit card-based payment 
gateway to receive online payments. We see this application as a necessary tool 
for government and private sector organisations to deploy in order to provide 
better service to their clients.’’</font></p>

<b>LG set to harness mobile handset growth</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im18.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="127" height="63">The regional mobile phone industry is growing rapidly and is set to increase on 
an average of 40 per cent annually. Leading industry analyst Gartner predicts 
that nearly 70 per cent of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 
2008. With the unveiling of its new flagship camera phones, LG is poised to 
harness this growth, consolidating its reputation as the innovation leader in 
handset design and functionality.<br>
<br>
To meet market demand, LG’s new LG T5100 is a dual screen, rotating clamshell 
style phone featuring an integrated 1.3 mega-pixel camera with flash 
functionality and video capability. Compact in design, the T5100 boasts a large 
262,000 colour internal screen and a 65,536 colour external screen. The 
integrated MP3 player allows music files, stored on the phone’s internal memory, 
to be played through the phone’s loudspeaker, or an attached stereo headset. <br>
<br>
Other phones launched in the region include the LG L1100, a tri-band camera 
phone suitable for global roaming with an attractive clamshell design. It is 
also GPRS and WAP enabled with integrated VGA quality camera with five picture 
resolutions, MMS multimedia messaging, voice memo recorder (for records up to 90 
seconds in 3 x 30 second recordings), Java engine and voice control. LG is 
targeting sales of $300 million (RO115.38 million) in handsets in the Middle 
East and Africa region this year.</font></p>

<b>Sony Ericsson introduces Walkman phones</b><br>
Sony Ericsson’s new 2005 mobile music strategy announced last month at the 3GSM 
World Congress, Cannes, France, features the integration of high quality digital 
music players into its classic, stylish mobile phones under the world famous 
Walkman brand. <br>
<br>
Sony Ericsson’s product team felt that a credible mobile music player had to 
combine key features like easy-to-use software to copy music to the device, 
large music storage <i>
<img border="0" src="im19.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="208"></i>capacity, long battery life, quality headphones and cutting 
edge design. The company is ideally positioned to integrate these features with 
advanced phone functions including excellent voice, messaging, imaging, and 
on-line connectivity, to create a device that not only satisfies consumer needs 
but offers great opportunities for network operators to develop new and exciting 
services. <br>
<br>
The first Walkman branded Sony Ericsson music phones will be announced in March 
and will enable users to transfer their existing CD collections to their phones 
via a PC. Future products will be capable of playing copy-protected music files 
purchased and downloaded via a PC from the Internet or direct to the phone.<br>
<br>
<i>A demonstrator from Sony Ericsson shows the new 3G phone Z800i during the 3GSM

play videos, music and games, and has a multidirectional camera</i></font></p>

options to operators</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im21.jpg" align="right" width="75" height="146">At the 3GSM 
World Congress in Cannes, France, Nokia last month expanded its portfolio of 
folding mobile phones with the stylish Nokia 6101 camera phone. In addition to 
offering consumers the latest mobile technology in an elegant fold concept, the 
Nokia 6101 provides operators with an extended range of customisation features. 
The compact, tri-band phone will be available in two versions: a GSM 
900/1800/1900 version primarily for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asian 
markets, and a GSM 850/1800/1900 model targeted towards the Americas. With an 
estimated retail price of less than 250 EUR (RO123.50), excluding taxes and 
subsidies, the Nokia 6101 is expected to start shipping in the second quarter of 
2005.<br>
<br>
Nokia also introduced a new arrival to the 3G arena – the Nokia 6680 imaging 
smartphone at the same forum last month. The 6680 is optimised for visual 
sharing, boasting two integrated cameras, a flash, and a bright screen of up to 
262,144 colours. Designed for ease-of-use, the active slide covering the back 
camera of the Nokia 6680 provides fast and intuitive camera activation as well 
as effortless switching between cameras during a video call.<br>
<br>
3G-enabled features such as two-way video calls, video sharing and always-on 
e-mail, making the well-designed Nokia 6680 a versatile work tool, complement a 
wide range of smartphone features, including organiser, video streaming and 
Internet browser. Based on the leading smartphone Series 60 Platform, the 
quad-band phone for GSM 900/1800/1900, EDGE and WCDMA networks offers seamless 
roaming in over 100 countries around the world. The Nokia 6680 imaging 
smartphone is expected to be available this month onwards with an estimated, 
unsubsidised sales price of approximately 500 euros (RO247).</font></p>

i at Arab Health 2005</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im20.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="125" height="117">GE 
Healthcare, a unit of General Electric Company, showcased the Vivid i—the 
world’s first miniaturised cardiovascular ultrasound system—at Arab Health 2005. 
Vivid i provides high-performance, full-featured imaging in a lightweight 
design. <br>
<br>
The Vivid i is the world’s first miniaturised cardiovascular ultrasound system, 
the result of integrating more than 20 years of expertise in ultrasound and 
cutting-edge computing technologies, as well as new patented technology 
developed by GE researchers. The Vivid i offers the functionality and high 
performance of full-featured, larger-scale systems – but in a portable and 
wireless design that weighs 30 times less. <br>
<br>
The system makes it possible for patients to receive diagnostic exams anywhere, 
including bedside, as opposed being transported to an imaging lab in a hospital. 
GE’s engineers developed Vivid i by miniaturising the components of a premium 
echocardiography system weighing more than 400 pounds (180 kg), to provide a 
portable system weighing only 10 pounds (less than 5 kg).</font></p>

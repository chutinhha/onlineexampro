                    of oil and gas, HE Dr Mohammed Bin Hamad Bin Saif Al Rumhy, 
                    has signed an agreement for the supply of natural gas to 
                    Sohar International Urea and Chemical Industries (SIUCI). As 
                    per the agreement, the government is to supply gas at 
                    reduced prices and for a period of 25 years to SIUCI’s 
                    plant. The government will supply the plant with around 1 
                    trillion cubic feet of gas during a period of 25 years and 
                    at a rate of 1 million cubic feet per day, the minister 
                    revealed. Supplying gas at reasonable price is a way of 
                    encouraging the Omani private sector to establish such 
                    projects in the country, he added.<br>
                    <br>
                    The project will be set up in Sohar industrial port zone and 
                    will be built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Japan. The 
                    project involves a total estimated investment of about $650 
                    million (RO250 million). Japan Bank for International 
                    Corporation and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance has 
                    approved the credit facilities for the project.<br>
                    <br>
                    The plant will have a production capacity of 3,500 tonnes 
                    per day of granular urea, which will be exported for sale on 
                    international market. Sixty to 70 per cent of Sohar refinery 
                    construction had been completed and work at the project is 
                    expected to finish in 2006.</font></p>

                    telecom rates<br>
                    </b>Oman Telecommunications Company (Omantel) announced more 
                    reductions in the international telecom tariff with effect 
                    from March 1, 2005, recently. Engineer Mohammed bin Ali Al-Wohaibi, 
                    executive president of Omantel, explained that the revised 
                    rates offer a reduction of up to 33 per cent in 140 
                    countries with significant international traffic worldwide. 
                    The new reductions are applicable to all Omantel and Oman 
                    Mobile calls including Hayyak, Jibreen, Sahl and Al-Multaqa 
                    (Payphone services). <br>
                    <br>
                    Al-Wohaibi further said that the major objective of the 
                    fresh reduction is to make the rates nationally, regionally 
                    and globally competitive and affordable to all communities 
                    in the Sultanate and to provide greater relief to corporate, 
                    government and SMEs to have cheaper means of communication, 
                    which will undoubtedly support the economic growth.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Omantel executive president also stressed that there 
                    will be a change in pulse rate, which will provide further 
                    relief to callers. The Fixed Telephone and Mobile (including 
                    Hayyak) services being billed for 1 full minute even for a 
                    call duration of 1 second will be revised to 30 seconds 
                    pulse, after the first full minute. </font></p>

                    as the completion of Omanisation of commercial outlets and

                    wholesale shops and the sales and distribution professions 
                    so that the Omanisation ratio can be brought to 65 per cent 
                    by the end of 2010, and 90 per cent by the end of 2015. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the IT sector, the seminar recommended for raising the

                    <br>
                    The increase in profitability can be attributed to increase 
                    in incomes such as fee and commission, trading-income, 
                    investment-income and the 18.18 per cent fall in interest 
                    expense from RO4.39 million in 2003 to RO3.64 million in 
                    2004. Operating profit grew by 15.92 per cent to RO13.9 
                    million as against RO11.99 million posted for the preceding 
                    year.</font></p>

            <img border="0" src="im1.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" width="250" height="252">Till the Asian tsunami disrupted
the economic growth party at
the fag end of the year, 2004
was shaping up to be the
healthiest year for developing
countries in the last three decades. East
Asia had come out of the crisis of
1997–98 stronger and more vibrant than
ever; the countries of Europe and
Central Asia were almost completely out
of the long shadow of transition from
socialism and were growing more rapidly;
and South Asian countries, on the
strength of continuing reforms, were
performing well.
<br>
            <br>
            Moreover, countries in Latin
America, Sub-Saharan Africa,
and the Middle East and North
Africa had a much better year. To
be sure, some countries within
each region had not enjoyed the
fruits of this recovery, and these
countries remain a source of concern.
But in aggregate, with or
without the tsunami, economic
growth in 2004 was impressive.
<br>
            <br>
            World trade grew by 10.2 per
cent in 2004, and played an
important role in the year’s exemplary
performance. On the policy side, the WTO discussions in August 2004
recouped the ground that was lost in late
2003 (after the Cancun WTO ministerial),
when governments concluded an
agreement that provides a framework
for pursuing the Doha Development
Agenda. The framework, however, is
only an outline—the actual agreement is
still to come. Whether the final agreement
contains provisions that will provide
a meaningful impulse to development
remains to be seen.
<br>
            <br>
            In the meantime, OER examines the
evidence on an important development
that is reshaping the fabric of the world
trading system: The dramatic proliferation
of regional trade agreements
(RTAs). These take various forms of
preferential reciprocal treaties—they can
be bilateral or plurilateral free trade
agreements (FTAs) or, less commonly,
customs unions.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>The background
<br>
            </b>In May 2003, US President George W.
Bush announced his initiative to create a
Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013.
Bush’s Middle East Free Trade
Agreement initiative seeks to promote
free trade throughout the region and
between the region and the US. Keeping
in mind the differing levels of development
across the region, the US is taking
a graduated step-by-step approach to
creating a free trade area with countries
interested and willing to open their
economies and liberalise their trade
regimes. Bush had outlined a country by-
country plan to achieve that goal.
<br>
            <br>
            Since that announcement, the US has
concluded FTA negotiations with
Morocco and Bahrain, signed Trade and
Investment Framework Agreements
(TIFAs) with Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Qatar
and Yemen, and now with Oman.
Recently, the 9/11 Commission has
urged the US to expand trade with the
Middle East and highlighted the recently
concluded FTA with Bahrain, as well
as the US’ recently passed FTA with
Morocco as examples of positive steps in
this direction.
<br>
            <br>
            The US already has TIFAs with
Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia. The US held
its first TIFA Council meetings with the
UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman last year. In addition, the US has made progress with the WTO accessions of
Saudi Arabia and Algeria, and in the
case of Algeria, extended GSP benefits.
<br>
            <br>
            The US is working to open markets
globally in the Doha WTO negotiations;
regionally through APEC and the Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)
negotiations; and bilaterally, with
FTAs. The Bush Administration has
completed FTAs with eleven countries
—Chile, Singapore, Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Australia, Morocco, and now Bahrain—
in the last two years.<br>
            <br>
Negotiations are under way or about
to begin with 10 more countries: Panama,
Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Thailand,
and the five nations of the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU).
New and pending FTA partners, taken
together, would constitute America’s
third largest export market and the sixth
largest economy in the world.
<br>
            <br>
            While the media and the public focus
on the deadly turmoil in Iraq, business
lobbyists have turned their attention to
another side of the fragile Middle East
region. Following up on the Bush
Administration’s call for a Middle East
Free Trade Area that would ‘‘embrace
and encourage reformers across the
region,’’ these businesses want Bush to
sign and implement FTAs with Oman,
the UAE and Bahrain as one of his first
post-inauguration tasks.
<br>
            <br>
            “Free Trade
Agreements with
Oman and the UAE
will help advance market-
oriented economic
reforms and will
help to demonstrate
to other Middle
Eastern nations the
important benefits of
trade liberalisation,”
said Bill Reinsch, President
of the National
Foreign Trade Council. “The
US-Middle East Free Trade
Coalition will work hard to
ensure these negotiations are
successful and that both
FTAs become a reality.”
<br>
            <br>
            Aerospace giant Boeing;
oil and chemical heavyweights
Dow Chemical, ChevronTexaco and Exxon
Mobil; and technology firms
Motorola and Intel are among those corporations
that have been urging congressional
approval of a Bahrain FTA,
signed in 2004. They also want to see
deals signed with Oman and the UAE.
(Exxon and Chevron have both donated
$250,000 (RO96154) to the 2005 presidential
Inaugural Committee; Boeing gave
$100,000 (RO38462).)
<br>
            <br>
            And just days before the inauguration,
the powerful and well-connected
Pharmaceutical Researchers and
Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)
weighed in on the issue too, saying a
trade agreement with Oman would provide
life-saving medicines to the region
and protect intellectual property standards
that make new drug R&amp;D possible.
Susan Kling Finston, PhRMA’s associate
vice-president for Middle
East/North African affairs, adds, ‘‘The
standards will promote an attractive
environment for foreign investment.’’
<br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, Qatar has held
two consultative meetings recently to set
out a negotiation schedule for a FTA
with the US. Economy Minister Sheikh
Mohammed bin Ahmad Al Thani said
last month the Americans asked to negotiate
separately with each Gulf state, and
that negotiations with Qatar would
begin later this year. Kuwait’s Trade and
Industry Minister Abdullah Al-Taweel
and US Trade Representative Robert
Zoellick signed a TIFA last month. This
accord has been described by Kuwait’s
Ambassador to the US Salem Al-Sabah
as ‘‘an introduction to the first round of
            FTA negotiations that will serve the
interests of the peoples and economies of
our two countries.’’
<br>
            <br>
            Subsequent to the TIFA’s signing,
the creation of a Kuwait-US Council for
Trade and Investment is expected to be
finalised. Ambassador Al-Sabah said the
Council, operating within the framework
of reaching a free trade agreement,
will review Kuwait-US trade and investment
relations as a step toward broader
commercial and economic opportunities.
In 2003, the US was Kuwait’s largest
single supplier of imports. That year,
Kuwait’s total imports were close to $7.5
billion (RO2.88 billion).
<br>
            <br>
            <b>FTA = RIFT?</b> <br>
So who would object to more Middle
East trade deals? None other than Saudi
Arabia, where most of the world’s oil
reserves sit, gave Bahrain the cold shoulder
when it signed a FTA with the US in
September 2004 (it won’t be implemented
until Congress approves it). Two-way
trade amounted to $887 million
(RO341.15 million) in 2003, with 57 per
cent of the total representing exports to
Bahrain, the unofficial financial hub of
the Gulf region. The trade agreement
would allow 100 per cent of US consumer
and industrial exports and 81 per
cent of farm produce to enter Bahrain
duty-free.
<br>
            <br>
            The Saudis contend that free trade
deals with the US could
undermine efforts to
promote greater regional
cooperation, since
the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council’s
(GCC) rules state that
all imports from outside
the group should
incur a 5 per cent import
tariff. Saudi Foreign
Minister Prince
Saud al-Faisal has
publicly expressed his
worries that when
GCC members sign bilateral deals separately
with international powers, the
required teamwork spirit is violated.
<br>
            <br>
            Economists feel that the Saudi-
Bahraini dispute over Manama’s free
trade pact with Washington that overshadowed
the latest summit of Gulf
Arab states could derail the Gulf
Cooperation Council’s (GCC) bid for
economic integration. GCC leaders
wound up the annual Zayed (25th GCC)
Summit in the Bahraini capital Manama
in December last year without settling
the row, casting strong doubts on
whether the six-member bloc will be
able to implement economic pacts.
<br>
            <br>
            Contrary to previous summits, the
final communiqué of the Manama meeting
dropped any reference to GCC plans
for a monetary union next year, a common
market in 2007 and a single currency
by the beginning of 2010. It also failed
to state an intention on the part of member
states to clear obstacles hindering a
smooth implementation of a Gulf customs
union launched two years ago.
<br>
            <br>
            Before launching the customs union
on January 1, 2003, the GCC states
agreed to delay the implementation of
some parts for up to three years in a bid
to find solutions to a number of political
and logistical problems. Under the
union, member states are supposed to
become a single customs zone in which
the duty on foreign
imports is 5 per cent.
All member states
have fixed their customs
tariffs at the
same level.
<br>
            <br>
            The GCC states,
however, have been
unable to find permanent
solutions for the
functioning of joint
customs centres set up
to facilitate the movement
of goods. They
also failed to overcome
problems created by applying customs
protection to scores of national
products, with each member state submitting
a list of goods to be excluded
from the union.
<br>
            <br>
            All six GCC member states have
agreed to share customs revenues temporarily
on the basis of the final destination
of imports, but have so far failed to
reach a permanent formula. They have
also prepared a draft law for anti-dumping,
but it has not been ratified. And they
are seeking to resolve conflicting interests
among agents of similar products in
various member states.
<br>
            <br>
            “GCC economies are competing
            with, rather than complementing, each
other. This has reduced inter-Gulf trade
to less than 10 per cent of the size of their
combined trade,” Abdulwahab Al
Harun, head of the Kuwaiti parliament’s
finance panel, told a symposium early
December last year.
<br>
            <br>
            To achieve a viable monetary union,
the Gulf states must implement key criteria
to bring their economic and fiscal
policies closer. They have approved in
principle standard criteria like budget
deficit, ratio of public debt to GDP, inflation
and interest rates and others, but no
permanent deals have been struck.<br>
            <br>
The precise parameters of the criteria
have not been finalised although they
agreed to set up a Gulf central bank. The
present ratios of public debt to GDP in
GCC states range between 17 and 80 per
cent while the maximum allowed percentage
in the European Union, for
example, is 60 per cent.
<br>
            <br>
            However, according to Bahraini
Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Shaikh Mohammed bin Mubarak Al
Khalifa, all the five other GCC member
states (except for Saudi Arabia) are negotiating
their own FTAs with the US. He
said while the issue of bilateral trade
agreements involving member states
was reviewed at the 25th GCC Summit,
further discussions to resolve differences
of opinion related to the negotiations
were postponed until GCC leaders
decide to continue.<br>
            <br>
‘‘All GCC countries agree on the
benefits of bilateral FTAs and no country
would sign any agreement if it was
harmful to another,’’ he had said. He
dismissed as untrue reports that Saudi
Arabia intended to impose duties,
because the FTA agreement signed by
Bahrain and similar deals being negotiated by other member
states, were not
in line with the GCC
Customs union.
‘‘This is far from the
truth. What country
would impose restrictions? All GCC
countries are taking measures to
reduce Customs obstacles at entry
points,’’ he said.
<br>
            <br>
            He also dismissed as untrue reports
that Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah had
not attended the summit in view of the
differences of opinion related to the FTA. ‘‘Crown Prince Abdullah issued a
statement in which he wished the summit
every success and Prince Sultan is an
outstanding representative for Saudi
Arabia at the summit.’’ He said that the
FTA was not an issue exclusive to
Bahrain and that all the other GCC states
were at various stages of negotiations.
<br>
            <br>
            He said that all member states
agreed to postpone discussion on the
progress of negotiations. ‘‘In fact, discussions
were not included in the summit
agenda because they were raised
one week before it was held,’’ he said.
‘‘Our main objective is to coordinate
our efforts, which all member states
agree is the best solution.’’ Shaikh
Mohammed said that all GCC countries
were negotiating an FTA with the US
individually ‘‘because the US could not
carry out the agreement with the GCC
states as a group’’.
<br>
            <br>
            He said that talks between the GCC
states and the European Union on economic
co-operation and a free trade area
would continue. ‘‘However, talks with
the EU have taken a long time, more
than 15 years. We hope that in a meeting
with GCC foreign ministers with their
EU counterparts in April, these issues
will be resolved,’’ he said.
<br>
            <br>
            He dismissed as untrue reports that
disputes at the summit had hindered
other economic agreements. ‘‘Yes, talks
on bilateral agreements were postponed,
but all other economic issues were
agreed on,’’ he said. ‘‘The final communiqué
included 11 economic-related
agreements, proposals and directives.’’
<br>
            <br>
            <b>US-Bahrain FTA: Dissecting the
deal
</b><br>
            The economic importance of the
Bahrain-US Free Trade Agreement
(FTA) and its potential impact on the
economy and the private sector cannot
be overstated. If implemented successfully,
the FTA will help in the exchange
of trade and services, not only between
Bahrain and the US, but also make the
kingdom an attractive centre for foreign
investments and industries that wish to
penetrate the US market.
<br>
            <br>
            The FTA is aimed at liberalising
trade in goods and services, facilitating
free market competition, stimulating the
inward flow of investment and expansion
in key manufacturing and services
sectors, encouraging the exchange of
expertise, and creating employment
opportunities. The FTA is also aimed at
making Bahrain a transit gateway for
American products to go to other countries
in the region. The Bahrain Chamber
of Commerce &amp; Industry (BCCI) is a
member of the FTA Supreme Committee
and has nominated its representatives in
the five emanating sub-committees,
namely: services, industrial, textile, legislative
and promotion subcommittees.
<br>
            <br>
            Early stages of the
Bahrain-US free trade negotiations
go back to the year
1999, with the signing of the
Bilateral Investment Treaty
(BIT), which entered into
force on May 30, 2001. It was
the first such treaty signed
between the US and a member
of the GCC and aimed at
stimulating the flow of private
investment between the
two countries. One year
later, the Trade &amp; Investment Framework Agreement
(TIFA) was signed on June 18,
2002, representing the prelude
for the FTA negotiations. The
TIFA was designed as a forum
for an ongoing bilateral dialogue
on economic reform and
trade liberalisation. Negotiating
an FTA with the US constituted
the next step.
<br>
            <br>
            The Kingdom of Bahrain and the
United States announced their intention
to negotiate an FTA on May 21, 2003.
HH the Crown Prince Sheikh Salman
Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa and Ambassador
Robert Zoellick, United States Trade
Representative, then discussed the
preparatory steps for the launch of Free
Trade Negotiations. On August 4, 2003,
Ambassador Zoellick formally notified
the US Congress of the Administration’s
intent to initiate FTA negotiations with
Bahrain.
<br>
            <br>
            After two rounds of FTA negotiations
on January 26, 2004 in Manama,
and during March 1–5, 2004 in
Washington, D.C., and an interim round
of technical discussions in London during
April 19–22, 2004, Bahrain’s Minister
of Finance &amp; National Economy, HE
Abdulla Hassan Saif, and Ambassador
Zoellick announced in Washington DC
the successful conclusion of the negotiations
on May 27, 2004.
<br>
            <br>
            Minister of Finance and National
Economy, HE Abdulla Hassan Saif led
the government of Bahrain’s negotiation
team while the US team was led by
Assistant United States Trade Representative
for Europe and the Mediterranean,
Ms. Catherine Novelli. Specific
chapters of the Free Trade Agreement
were negotiated by individual negotiation
committees, which comprised of
representatives of all the ministries and
government agencies concerned.<br>

Bahraini exports of goods and services
to the markets of the US and US FTA partners, relative to exports of
other countries.
<br>
            3. Expanding the manufacturing sector,
especially since manufacturers
from the surrounding region are able
to establish ventures in Bahrain and
add 35 per cent domestic content in
order to qualify for duty-free treatment.
<br>
            4. Creating employment opportunities
for educated and highly skilled
workers.
<br>
            5. Increasing Bahrain’s competitive
advantage in terms of attracting
inward investment. Coupled with
the BIT, the FTA will further enable
American investors to enjoy current
advantages and incentives and
expand sector-specific benefits available
to entrepreneurs wishing to
locate in Bahrain.

market access and benefits for
Bahrain businesses wishing to supply
cross-border services as well as
businesses wishing to establish presence
in the US.
<br>
            7. Expanding Bahrain’s financial services
sector, especially in emerging
key service areas such as insurance
and Islamic Banking.
<br>
            8. Strengthening the Bahraini private
sector and increase its contribution
to the national economy.
<br>
            9. Reinforcing Bahrain’s position as a
gateway to the surrounding region.
10. Growth of the retail sector in
Bahrain, which contributes to 13 per
cent of GDP.
<br>
            11. Facilitating the exchange of technology
and expertise.
<br>
            12. Stimulating the ITC and ECommerce
activities in
Bahrain.
<br>
            13. Promoting economic
growth and further diversification
of Bahrain’s
economy as a result of the
expansion in trade and the
increased foreign direct
investment in the various
manufacturing and services
sectors.
<br>
            14. Reinforcing and further
strengthening the practices
of transparency and
openness<br>
            <br>
            <b>Oman: Anatomy of a deal</b> <br>
Oman became the 139th member of the WTO on November 9, 2000. In acceding,
Oman made a number of important
modifications to its trade regime, dismantling
barriers to goods and services.
Yet, barriers remain, particularly for
investment and in some services and
goods sectors.
<br>
            <br>
            The March 2002 Monterrey
Consensus, reached at the United
Nations’ International Conference on
Financing for Development, emphasised
that countries need to attract investment
inflows through the development of a
“transparent, stable and predictable
investment climate, with proper contract
enforcement and respect for property

rights” and of “economic
policy and regulatory frameworks
for promoting and
protecting investments.”
<br>
            <br>
            Strong investor protections
are also critical to foster
the rule of law, to reduce corruption
and build institutions,
to promote respect for
and the protection of private property
and contract rights, and to create a regulatory
environment hospitable to capital
formation in general and international
investment in particular. Without these
protections, foreign investment will simply
not flow to the countries that need it
most.<br>
            <br>
To put things in perspective, here are
a few facts: US exports to Oman—
including machinery, aircraft, vehicles,
and electrical machinery—totalled just
$323 million (RO124.23 million) in 2003 –
half the amount the US exported to
Haiti. US exports of agricultural products
to Oman were $13 million (RO5 million),
including sugars, sweeteners and
beverage bases, and vegetable oils. US
goods imports from Oman in 2003 were
$695 million (RO267 million), including
mineral fuel, woven apparel, repaired
products, precious stones, and knit
apparel. US imports of agricultural
products from Oman were $2 million
(RO769,231).
<br>
            <br>
            However, trade agreements would
spur increased exports and stimulate
investment in a strategic, if not tiny,
regional market. To get a bigger slice of
the multibillion-dollar construction pie
in Lebanon, Qatar, Oman and the UAE
these days, the Association of
Equipment Manufacturers has been
clamouring for expanded trade agreements
in the Gulf. The group represents
Caterpillar, Gehl and Astec Industries,
among others.<br>
            <br>
US Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick travelled to the UAE and the
Sultanate of Oman last year to discuss
efforts to promote economic growth and
opportunity by expanding bilateral,
regional and global trade. ‘‘In recent
years, the Gulf region has become associated
with economic reforms and trade
liberalisation, with the launching of the
current World Trade Organisation
(WTO) negotiations in Doha, Qatar, and
our recent completion of an FTA with
Bahrain. I’m interested in learning more
about the economic reforms and development
plans in Oman and the UAE,’’
Zoellick had then said.
<br>
            <br>
            ‘‘US FTAs are high quality, cutting edge
agreements that can play an important
role in stimulating economic growth
and development over time,’’ said
Zoellick. ‘‘Both Oman and the UAE have
expressed interest in deepening their
economic relationship with the US,
including with FTAs, and I look forward
to discussing the challenges and opportunities
involved in negotiating a comprehensive
FTA with the US.’’
<br>
            <br>
            In Oman, Zoellick met Minister of
Commerce &amp; Industry HE Maqbool Bin
Ali Sultan; and Minister of National
Economy HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi
Macki. The US earlier concluded an FTA
with Bahrain, and signed a TIFA with
both the UAE and Oman. The TIFAs
provide a forum for the US to examine
ways to expand bilateral trade and
investment and can be used as a forum
to launch negotiations for an FTA.
<br>
            <br>
            HE Maqbool
Sultan confirmed last
month that 40 US
officials will be visiting
Oman this month
for negotiations to
conclude an FTA.
There will be 12
teams deliberating on
different topics from
labour to customs
issues, he said, noting
that Oman was prepared
to sign the FTA on a bilateral basis despite opposition
from Saudi Arabia.<br>
            <br>
According to the minister, further
negotiations will take place in March
and April for the FTA, which both
nations are expected to sign in July. A US
delegation will visit Oman on March 12-
14 to discuss the accord and an Omani
delegation will hold talks in the US on
April 18. If approved by the US
Congress, the agreement will become
effective in 2006, revealed the minister.
<br>
            <br>
            Including an investment chapter in
the US-Oman FTA is extremely important
not only for US
investors and US economic
interests, but also for Oman’s
own diversification priorities
which require significant foreign
capital. Early last
month, HE Maqbool Sultan
acquainted businessmen,
Omani private sector officials
and representatives of
the companies operating in
the Sultanate with the FTA
the Sultanate intends to sign
with the US.
<br>
            <br>
            The minister conformed
that the US had signed similar agreements
with Australia, Jordan, Morocco,
Bahrain and Singapore and is negotiating
for the same purpose at present with
the Sultanate and the UAE. He said a
framework agreement on investment
and trade between USA and AGCC
states had already been signed and the
Sultanate was the last state to ink the
pact in June last year.
<br>
            <br>
            He said that the agreement was the
first and would be followed by the signing
of the FTA with the US. HE
Maqbool Sultan cited two reasons for
the Sultanate’s signing the FTA individually
with the US. He said the first reason
was that the US sees that the agreement
should be concluded between
states and not with economic blocs like
the AGCC because in that case, it will
take years to conclude.
<br>
            <br>
            The second reason, the minister
said was that the pact would not cover
commodities only, but include services
and other matters governed by different
laws in different AGCC member
states like foreign banks and the attitude
towards telecommunications sector
liberalisation.
<br>
            <br>
            The minister reviewed the subjects
covered in the planned agreement which
include custom duties, financial services,
communications, insurance, capital market,
foreign capital share, government
purchases, tenders and labour.
<br>
            <br>
            Eng. Salim bin Said al Ghatami,
OCCI President, said in an address at the
outset of the meeting, the Sultanate seeks
by entering into negotiations with the
US to open up prospects for investment
cooperation and expanding trade
exchange and free flow of commodities
and services between the two countries.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>UAE: A deal in the making</b> <br>
            UAE was a founding member of the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) and
continues to participate on multilateral
trade liberalisation efforts. It has
worked to diversify its economy particularly
through tourism, manufacturing,
financial services and entrepot trade,
fostered by its development of the
largest man-made seaport in the world.
In March 2004, UAE signed a TIFA with
the US and, in December 2004, it also
signed a Container Port Security
Initiative with the US, to protect global
trade routes.
<br>
            <br>
            The UAE, home to the third-busiest
port in the world and a $8 billion
(RO3.08 billion) customer of US defence
weapons, wants its own deal completed
in Bush’s second term. In mid-January,
CMS Energy testified before officials at
the US trade representative’s office in
favour of a UAE trade agreement. Easy
to see why: The UAE’s soaring demand
for electric power bodes well for CMS,

which owns 40 per
cent of an $800 million
(RO307.7 million)
independent
water and power cogeneration

US goods exports to the UAE in 2003
were $3.5 billion (RO.135 billion), including
machinery, aircraft, vehicles, electrical
machinery and optic and medical
instruments. US exports of agriculture
products to the UAE totalled $259 million
(RO100 million) in 2003, including
live animals and tree nuts. US goods
imports from the UAE in 2003 totalled
$1.1 billion (RO423 million), including
mineral fuel, woven apparel and knit
apparel.

            With Bahrain as a precedence, the
successful conclusion of FTA talks
between the US and UAE is seen as a
given by most quarters within both the
countries. However, the UAE still has
some way to go to reach the required
economic standards. In particular, the
US has highlighted labour laws as a
cause for concern, stating that the UAE
and its neighbours will have to implement
International Labour
Organisation-consistent laws before any
agreement can be reached.
<br>
            <br>
            ‘‘UAE will have to change its labour
code to meet international labour laws,
revise the agency law and investment /
sponsorship rules in order to sign a FTA
with the US,’’ said Zoellick. In response,
the UAE has announced plans to allow
its mainly expatriate workforce to set up
trade unions, a key condition of any US
free trade pact.

            <b>Trade beyond US
</b><br>
            The GCC and its primary trading partner,
the European Union (EU), are working
actively towards an FTA between the
two trade bodies. Both of them are looking
at segments of cooperation to boost
the member economies between the
regions. The GCC plans to sign the longawaited
pact between the GCC and the
EU in the near future.
<br>
            <br>
            Saudi Arabia took a prudent step late
last year in boosting inter-region trade,
especially as the biggest market in the
region. It removed double pricing on
gas, in return for the GCC agreement on
meeting a call on the EU to lift taxes on
petrochemicals and aluminium products.
The biggest stumbling point in the
talks has been trivial issues such as the
double pricing on gas and EU taxation
on Gulf petrochemicals and aluminium
between the two groups.
<br>
            <br>
            Moreover, in the last quarter of 2004,
the government of India kick-started the
process for clinching a FTA with the
GCC, with which New Delhi had
entered into a framework agreement for
economic cooperation in August. The
India-GCC joint commerce and trade
committee, which will meet defined the
contours of a preferential/FTA with the
GCC, which accounts for 11 per cent of
India’s exports.
<br>
            <br>
            The framework agreement with the GCC is aimed at exploring opportunities
in areas of oil and gas, knowledge-based
products, education, health and other
investments. Indo-GCC trade has lately
been on the rise. Indian exports to the
GCC countries were about $7 billion
(RO2.7 billion) in 2003-2004, a 43 per cent
jump over the previous year. Imports
(excluding oil) from the GCC
were $3.5 billion (RO1.34 billion)
last fiscal, which was 72
per cent higher than the
imports the year before.
<br>
            <br>
            The potential for regional
and bilateral cooperation is
very vast and the agreement
would enable India and the AGCC countries to work
together. The second AGCC India Industrial Conference will be held in Oman in 
            January 2006.</font></p>

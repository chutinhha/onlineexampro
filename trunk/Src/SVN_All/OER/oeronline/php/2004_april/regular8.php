            career </b><br>
            I graduated in commerce from Bangalore University, India. I 
            always had a flair for accounting and mathematics which made me to 
            pursue a professional course in accounting and I completed my 
            Chartered Accountancy course in Bangalore. At the time, there was a 
            big boom in the IT sector and I felt that I had to have skills to 
            match so I took a postgraduate diploma course in systems management 
            followed by a course in Oracle financials. <br>
            <br>
            In 1992, I started my 
            career as a finance manager in Bangalore working for a private 
            company which was involved in the dyeing of yarns. In 1993, I got an 
            opportunity to work for Pepsi as a finance executive. My role was to 
            implement accounting and MIS systems in Pepsi's bottling plant in 
            Bangalore and logistics division in Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai. 
            During 1994, the stock market was booming and many finance 
            professionals were attracted to working in merchant banking. I 
            stepped into this profession as a Consultant to a merchant banker. 
            <br>
            <br>
            By 1997, the Landmark Group, a large retailer operating since 1973 
            in the GCC, was embarking on major expansion in the Gulf. Landmark 
            aimed to hire finance professionals who instinctively had very good 
            finance skills. Over a period of time they would groom these 
            professionals to become retail managers. I grabbed the opportunity 
            of working as an Audit Manager at their Head Office in Dubai and 
            within a year I was posted to one of their territories in Qatar as a 
            Finance Manager. Four months later, the company offered me an even 
            bigger responsibility in Kuwait where my responsibilities changed 
            from finance to core retailing. I was promoted as DGM reporting to 
            the Managing Director and was independently handling some of the key 
            brands for the Group. During October 2002, I was given the chance to 
            head Oman's operations as GM. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What does your job role entail? </b><br>
            The 
            Landmark Group operates in the GCC and India. By the end of June 
            2004, it will have over 280 stores. As General Manager in Oman, my 
            responsibility is to strategise the presence of our brands and to 
            implement the vision of the Group in providing the best value for 
            lifestyle products to our customers. I report to the Board of 
            Directors and my role includes directing and leading the entire team 
            in Oman while sharing and aligning the objectives of each team 
            member with objectives set for the Group. The company's philosophy 
            has always been that the customer comes first which translates into 
            core values such as 'listen carefully', 'constantly adapt' and 
            'always deliver'. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tell us about what brands the Landmark Group 
            markets in Oman </b><br>
            The Landmark group has several brands operating in 
            the GCC. In Oman, there are five brands at present: <br>
            <i>The Baby Shop:</i> 
            About 30 years old, this is one of Landmark's oldest retail brands. 
            In Muscat our first store was opened in 1992 in Qurum. Today, Oman 
            has five Baby Shop stores. Our range of products includes clothing 
            and nursery furniture for infants, fashion clothing for toddlers and 
            children, as well as toys and activity furniture for children of all 
            age groups. We retail international brands like Disney, Mattel, 
            Graco, Peg Perego, and Little Tikes. <br>
            <i>Splash:</i> The Splash brand offers 
            fashion clothing for men and ladies, both teenagers and adult. Apart 
            from our own in-house brands, we also have franchises for 
            international brands like Lee Cooper casual wear from France, Li-Ning 
            Sports wear from China, and Zodiac formal wear from India. <br>
            <i>Home 
            Centre:</i> The Home Centre brand offers a wide variety of fashionable 
            furniture to dress up your living room, bedroom, dining room, 
            kitchen and kids room. In addition, there is a big variety of home décor merchandise to accessorise a home including lamps, carpet, 
            bedding and garden furniture also. <br>
            <i>Shoe City: </i>The Shoe City brand 
            offers fashionable and comfortable footwear for children, men and 
            ladies. Our range of formal, casual and sports shoes from 
            international brands include Pablosky, Ecco, Reebok, and Adidas. 
            There are five Shoe City stores in Muscat. <i>Lifestyle:</i> Lifestyle is 
            our newest brand to be introduced in Oman. Our range includes 
            products catering to the contemporary woman be it cosmetics, 
            perfumes, fashion accessories, spa, health and beauty products, 
            watches, and gifts. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Why is City Plaza such a busy shopping venue?</b><br>
            I 
            believe that customers like shopping at City Plaza [our major retail 
            venue] because of the brand values that we offer. We offer the best 
            value with a range of international lifestyle merchandise all under 
            one roof. Most of our customers enjoy browsing at our new collection 
            and find that their visit to City Plaza is always enjoyable. It is a 
            complete family shopping experience. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Your advertisements are 
            distinctive. What role did you play in their creation?</b><br>
            I feel that a 
            message being conveyed in any advertisement should not be explicit 
            but instead it should be implied and intelligent. I work closely 
            with our advertisement agency in providing the necessary brief for 
            the kind of communication required for a brand / tactical campaign. 
            We try to be different by being creative, innovative with a touch of humour, intrigue, and surprise so as to bring a smile on the faces 
            of our customers. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What home furnishings are most popular?</b> <br>
            In Oman, 
            we find that our female customers are very particular about dressing 
            up their homes, be it the bedroom, children's room or the dining 
            room. They prefer to mix and match all the accessories in the house 
            to either the colour of their room or furniture. Over the years, 
            with our experience of operating in the region and the international 
            fashion trends, we have been able to provide new ideas to dress up a 
            home. This complements our retailing and hence all the categories in 
            home furnishings are equally popular. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What other things have you 
            noticed about peoples' tastes when it comes to clothing? </b><br>
            I find that 
            the customers in Oman are well aware of the latest international 
            trends in fashion and lifestyle. This could either be due to their 
            travel abroad or to Dubai or due to the exposure of such trends in 
            the media. Our customers are particular for colours of the season 
            and ask for new styles in vogue. The expectation of receiving a very 
            good service is also very high locally which makes us continually 
            benchmark ourselves on the current level of service we offer and 
            look out for ways to improve it further. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What future challenges are 
            retailers in Oman likely to face?</b><br>
            With the initiatives taken up by 
            the government in relaxing various regulations and promoting 
            aggressively the tourism industry, in the years to come there will 
            be new international retailers eyeing a share of this market. 
            Presently organised retailing is still in the growth phase and there 
            is room for retailers who can provide international quality products 
            at a very good value. However I believe there will be shift of 
            customers from the unorganised retail sector due to a change in 
            customer spending behaviour and the need to shop at a one-stop shop 
            / destination mall. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Have you ever won a shop promotion before? 
            </b><br>
            During 1997, I had won 2 tickets to watch the Dubai Tennis Open 
            Match in Dubai. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Do you find any similarities between Muscat and 
            Bangalore? </b><br>
            My wife, my daughter aged nine, my son aged six and I 
            love Muscat. We find it very close to my home town Bangalore which 
            is also green and is called 'The Garden City of India'. The 
            beautiful landscaping, and the combination of mountains and beaches 
            are unique. The people in Oman are extremely friendly which makes 
            you always feel at home.</font></p>

            <b>Airbags, crumple zones, and side impact bars have largely become 
            a standard feature in cars helping to reduce injuries from traffic 
            accidents in recent years. However, traffic fatalities in the GCC 
            have continued to rise. Generally, car buyers are willing to pay 
            more for added safety features - with a limit. But if you can't 
            afford certain luxury cars that install safety items as standard 
            features, you do have the chance to buy them separately. OER looks 
            at a small selection of gadgets for motorists that could save lives

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Independent studies 
            have suggested that accidents are four times more likely amongst 
            motorists who use mobile phone handsets. Some governments around the 
            world are implementing severe penalties for holding a phone while 
            driving like the US and UK. GCC Traffic Week held last month was 
            aimed at curbing the level of reckless driving in the region 
            including cautioning dangerous drivers who take calls while driving. 
            Probably the most sensible and convenient solution for such drivers 
            is to choose a bluetooth car kit. There are plenty to choose from 
            but a small selection is shown below. </font></p>

            Car/Large Caravan DIY Pack</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="GIZ-ultr.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="100">This 
            product is an affordable safety application that is essential for 
            motorcycles but can also be used on vehicles with temporary or no 
            spare tyres, lone or late-night travellers, caravans, trailers, 
            horseboxes, and any vehicle where protection against punctures is 
            required for business or personal assurance. <br>
            <br>
            According to its manufacturers, Ultraseal is a special blend of 
            chemicals in a viscous liquid state which coats and clings to the 
            inner wall of the tyre. In essence, it is a 'permanent' puncture 
            preventative and tyre life extender/conditioner. Ultraseal is not a 
            get you home product, it is applied before the puncture occurs, and 
            permanently seals puncture after puncture in the tyre as they occur. 
            Once installed, Ultraseal not only seals punctures, it conditions 
            the inner casing, preventing porosity leaks caused by tiny holes and 
            cracks. In other words, the tyres maintain correct air pressure and 
            the need to regularly top up with air is virtually eliminated. More 
            important for drivers in Oman, your tyres also run cooler 
            eliminating that killer problem of devastating heat build-up. Price: 
            £49.95 (RO31)</font></p>

            Ultrasonic 2880V Parking Sensor Kit </b><br>
            If you can't get bumper backup sensors as a standard feature or even 
            an option on your car, what can you do? Well, why not try buying the 
            gadget and fitting it yourself. Reverse Parking Assist systems such 
            as this kit allow you to safely park in the smallest of spaces. As 
            well as alerting you of parked cars the system can detect children 
            and low walls, which are out of normal vision. The parking assist 
            system is supplied as an easy to fit kit with a choice of sensor 
            fitting options dependant on your requirements. The system is 
            automatically activated when you engage reverse gear. Small sensors 
            are fixed to the rear of the vehicle, they send and receive 
            ultrasonic radio waves which bounce off obstacles and alert you to 
            their presence. There is an internal buzzer that gradually increases 
            in frequency as you approach the object. A continuous tone denotes 
            that you are within 0.35m of the obstacle. Price: £199.99 (RO125)

            Control Coatings </b><br>
            As summer approaches, V-Kool, a space age coating which can be 
            applied as a solar control film on automotive windows and 
            windshields, can provide added safety, comfort and a level of 
            sophistication to your automobile. V-Kool film is certainly a 
            well-known product in Oman. The main way that it can provide safety 
            is to protect against harmful infrared and ultraviolet rays. Tinted 
            window films could also lessen the way glass flies around your 
            vehicle during a motoring collision. <br>
            <br>
            Having a sun-protecting factor of over 130 on your windscreen is a 
            wonderful benefit but it also undoubtedly offers driver comfort. V-Kool 
            can reduce the cabin temperature by 7 to 12 degrees Celsius. This 
            means that it could also save on electricity and fuel as you lower 
            your air conditioning. <br>
            <br>
            Price: The cost of applying V-KOOL clear heat control films on your 
            car depends on its size. On average you can expect to pay around 
            RO250 for a small saloon and RO275 to RO300 for a mid-sized 4WD.</font></p>

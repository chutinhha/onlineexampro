            The new renaissance in value propositions<br>
            By Joseph A. DiVanna <br>
            Price: RO17.100; 264pp <br>
            Palgrave Macmillan <br>
            <br>
            Financial services Industry has globally recognised the arrival of 
            e-delivery concepts as an essential part of future development of 
            services and products in the entire range of financial intermediary 
            services starting from banking to capital market activities 
            encompassing insurance, mutual funds etc. Yet, multiple options, 
            large investments, mass and class education cost has left financial 
            services chieftains, planners and dreamers wondering where do they 
            place value perception to the e-service products for customers, 
            shareholders and business. <br>
            <br>
            Redefining Financial Services by Joseph A. DiVanna comes as a breath 
            of fresh air as what is traditionally known as &quot;what the doctor 
            ordered&quot; for the dreamers in the financial services industry. This 
            book presents the opinion that a value proposition must stand alone 
            on the perceived value of the service or product - not the 
            instrument by which it is delivered. With a well structured value 
            proposition, e-services have the potential to let the financial 
            intermediary own its own currency and with settlement systems, 
            financial services sector will rival the government backed currency 
            through e-money, credit card, ATM card, loyalty cards, frequent 
            flyer etc. Merely low cost service is not the value proposition. 
            Value proposition is the synergistic relationship between pricing 
            and quality of offering. <br>
            <br>
            Joseph DiVanna has taken great efforts to deal with individual 
            economies of Africa, Asia, Taiwan, China, Down Under, European, East 
            European and Middle
            <img border="0" src="im10.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="124">East 
            in individual chapters. Think global, act regional, look local is 
            the recommendation for Middle Eastern context and it's so hard to 
            disagree with the author on that count.<br>
            <br>
            If you are in charge of developing a 21st century agenda for your 
            financial institution or have a penchant to dream future course, you 
            would love the book. <br>

            The illustrated guide to globalisation<br>
            <br>
            By Christopher Arnander<br>
            Price: RO6.200; 186pp<br>
            Profile Books</b><br>
            <br>
            I have always loved books with pictures. Especially those with 
            cartoons or caricatures that are coupled with a bit of wry humour 
            that sort of make you chuckle, not laugh out loud. What makes such 
            books all the more interesting is if you happen to have seen some of 
            the illustrations somewhere before. That, in essence, is perhaps the 
            greatest strength of the illustrated guide to globalisation, a 
            wealth of illustrations, some thought-provoking, some disdainful, 
            some pedestrian but all with that wily way of reminding you that you 
            have seen them somewhere before. <br>
            <br>
            What also struck me as I leafed through the credits, it that the 
            book saved much of its best to the very end: a listing of 
            &quot;so-called&quot; &quot;milestones of globalisation&quot; that provides you with 
            amazing little nuggets. Sample this: tobacco was introduced to 
            England in 1565 more than 50 years before the first newspaper 
            appeared in the UK in 1622 or that the Bank of England was founded 
            in 1694 shortly after the first postal service started between 
            Falmouth and Spain in 1689 or that Paul Reuter (does his name sound 
            familiar?) sent stock market prices by pigeon in 1849 more than 2 
            centuries after the birth of the first newspaper in the UK! <br>
            <br>
            However, the rest of the book, or the 99.8% that precedes this 
            little goldmine of information unfortunately follows a somewhat 
            stodgy, dogged format of seeks to provide
            <img border="0" src="im11.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="128">a 
            year-by-year account of the key happenings from across the world - 
            most often from the perspective of our Anglo-Saxon brethren. <br>
            <br>
            The one redeeming fact of course, is that the book packs a fair 
            punch for its 180-odd pages - especially if you are in the realms of 
            academia &quot;cramming&quot; for the next general knowledge quiz or an 
            information-geek. I am.<br>

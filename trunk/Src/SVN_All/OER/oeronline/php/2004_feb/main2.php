                  How did the two-and-a-half-day seminar-cum-workshop on Asset 
                  Financing &amp; Leasing go, and what was the quality of attendees?
                  </b><br>
                  Thank you. Two-and-a-half days in the classroom have given me 
                  a lot of perspective on Omani finance companies. I listened 
                  very carefully to the audience, their questions, their 
                  comments... The quality has to be prefaced - one, it is a 
                  young industry. Notwithstanding the fact that leasing has been 
                  around here for about 16-17 years, from everything I'm told, 
                  it's the last five years that have really created the growth 
                  mode. So, I'm going to call it a 5-to-7-year-old industry.<br>
                  <br>
                  In that context, the quality is impressive even though a large 
                  part of the business is a simple business, i.e., the retail 
                  automotive business, which doesn't require a genius to 
                  operate. Nonetheless, finance companies in Oman are staffed by 
                  intelligent, smart, savvy people. <br>
                  <br>
                  (During the seminar) I was discussing things that I discuss in 
                  reasonably mature markets because the objective was to take 
                  the audience to the next level. You don't come here and tell 
                  them what they already know or the basics. So, I was truly 
                  impressed, particularly with the personnel from the finance 
                  companies, who were keeping me alert. Two-thirds of the 
                  attendees were expatriates while the rest were Omanis - it was 
                  a homogenous mix of intelligence. <br>
                  <br>
                  Even the personnel from the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) -- and 
                  when I say 'even from', I mean that when you go into the 
                  regulatory environment, you usually encounter a different 
                  person -- kept me awake all the time. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Broadly speaking, what were the issues that were discussed 
                  during the seminar? <br>
                  </b>We discussed a lot of issues - all the way from policy to 
                  hard roll-up-your-sleeve mechanics, e.g., how to convince a 
                  customer to lease because leasing is cheaper than cash, etc. 
                  Really, almost A to Z. <b><br>
                  <br>
                  What, according to you, were the benefits for those who 
                  attended the seminar?<br>
                  </b>This was the first seminar of its kind not only in Oman 
                  but also in the region. So, the audience here never had the 
                  opportunity to sit through dedicated lease education before 
                  this seminar. So, obviously, it opened their eyes. After all, 
                  they saw the potential the product has. <br>
                  Given the reasonable infancy of the industry (e.g., I went 
                  through 27 benefits that leasing can offer; and I don't 
                  believe that all of those present were aware of all of them), 
                  it did open their eyes. For instance, off-balance-sheet 
                  finance is one benefit that, maybe, they've heard of, maybe 
                  they've understood as well, but not in detail and definitely 
                  not in practice. <br>
                  Off-balance-sheet financing itself has certain benefits such 
                  as the enhancement of ratios, improvement in earnings etc. 
                  which they may not have been aware of in depth prior to this 
                  seminar. <br>
                  What this seminar and others like it will do is that it will 
                  help the attendees increase their penetration. Otherwise, why 
                  would a lessor invest his time and money in such a forum 
                  unless he went back and did more business? I challenged them 
                  at the end of two-and-a-half days and said each of you has to 
                  give your CEO three ideas that are implementable. I'm hoping 
                  that they will do that. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>What, according to you, were the learnings for Oman? </b>
                  <br>
                  According to HE Hamood Sangour Al Zadjali, the executive 
                  president of CBO, the leasing credit as a percentage of 
                  banking and leasing credit was 5.8 per cent (5.47 per cent if 
                  you combine both the figures) in the country. The global 
                  average for the same is 20-25 per cent. The way forward, in no 
                  particular order, is: <br>
                  </font><font size="1" face="Marlett">h</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
                  To increase the penetration that leasing has in Oman. <br>
                  </font><font size="1" face="Marlett">h</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
                  The government should seriously consider, as a means of 
                  finance, some of the larger infrastructure projects that are 
                  in the pipeline. I am not aware of the details, but I'm told 
                  that money is going to be spent. Throughout the world, the 
                  government is a big lessee. In mature markets, the government 
                  is one of the bigger lessees. <br>
                  </font><font size="1" face="Marlett">h</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
                  An increase in corporate and retail leasing will be the second 
                  contributor to growth of this industry. Currently, as things 
                  stand, of the total leasing, 28 per cent is corporate and 72 
                  per cent is retail. I would really like to see that blend get 
                  to 50:50 in the next three-four years. <br>
                  </font><font size="1" face="Marlett">h</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
                  Dialogue between government regulators and industry. It has 
                  taken place in the past, but what the seminar has done is 
                  brought them together for the first time into one common forum 
                  and they saw the significance of the product, they saw that 
                  certain issues had to be &quot;cleaned up&quot; in order for leasing to 
                  get going in Oman.<br>
                  <br>
                  Lessors have a job to do with increasing the awareness of the 
                  corporate lessee. I hope that after this, there are forums 
                  conducted by the sub-committee or the banking committee of the 
                  chamber of commerce etc. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>How should this seminar be followed up to maintain 
                  momentum?</b> <br>
                  I am hoping that there will be more such forums in Oman so 
                  that we can really focus on having an honest, straightforward 
                  dialogue between the industry and the regulators so that 
                  issues that are hindering the industry's growth come to the 
                  fore and can be addressed. <br>
                  Given the inherent financial skills and intelligence levels of 
                  those who attended the conference, I have challenged them to 
                  take specific things from the seminar and implement them. And 
                  I am convinced that at least each of these six private 
                  companies will do something to increase their share. <br>
                  As far as the other part of the audience is concerned 
                  (regulators), I don't know if it will be [possible for them to 
                  start doing something as soon as they next go to their 
                  workplace because they are not in the commercial side, but I 
                  am sure that their awareness would have definitely increased. 
                  I saw nothing but enthusiasm and I am hopeful that we will see 
                  certain steps from the regulators in the intermediate term.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Where do you think Omani leasing &amp; finance industry stacks 
                  up against its peers in the GCC? </b><br>
                  Corporate leasing here in Oman as a percentage of GDP is 
                  3/10th of 1 per cent. Now, in the entire world, the average is 
                  2 per cent, including the mature and the emerging markets etc. 
                  So, that's the good news for Oman. I.e., the industry has room 
                  to grow based on that one very common global average. <br>
                  Oman's history is longer - retail corporate size is about the 
                  same as the rest of the countries in the region. More or less, 
                  all of them are at par with respect to product offering and 
                  level of sophistication. The expat contribution here will make 
                  the difference.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>How long do you think it will take Oman's leasing industry 
                  to attain maturity? </b><br>
                  I presented something called the 6 stages of the leasing 
                  cycle. In the US, it took us 40-50 years to get from Stage I 
                  to Stage VI. I will use an intermediate case in point - in 
                  Australia, it took them 20 years to get from Stage I to Stage 
                  VI for obvious reasons. The technology cycle in leasing got 
                  shorter because these guys studied the evolution of the US 
                  industry.<br>
                  <br>
                  Using the US and Australia as the two cases in point, this day 
                  onward, Oman has the same opportunity. It can progress down 
                  that leasing cycle much faster. And that template actually was 
                  presented in the seminar. Oman is already at the end of Stage 
                  I and we really are entering Stage II. I believe Oman can 
                  enter Stage V in about 5 years. Stage VI is maturity. Stage V 
                  gets us at least into securitisation (a transfer of lease 
                  receivables to investors through a bankruptcy remote special 
                  purpose entity). Stage III is operating leases. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>What is the difference between asset financing/leasing and 
                  lending by banks? </b><br>
                  Loans or credit, obviously, have to do with one thing and one 
                  thing only - the creditworthiness of the customer. You do the 
                  credit due diligence and that's it. In the context of 
                  asset-based finance, you've got an underlying asset which, in 
                  the corporate world, if it's a productive asset, will generate 
                  the cash to pay back the rentals. The underlying asset is 
                  creating the incremental cash to pay back the rental. So, 
                  that's really what asset-based lending is.<br>
                  Leasing, in the past 20 years, has grown at a Compound Annual 
                  Growth of 12 per cent whereas banking's growth in terms of 
                  credit has been in single digit. So, leasing has been popular 
                  and has been competing well with the bankers. n</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Crude oil prices 
            have risen by about 35 per cent this year to levels not seen since 
            the early 1980s. The latest rises are causing worries in importing 
            countries about the economic cost of higher energy prices. Higher 
            fuel prices can cause unwelcome rises in inflation, restrict 
            economic growth and are unpopular with voters. Let’s look why prices 
            are so high.</font></b></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>
            <img border="0" src="im37.jpg" align="right" width="127" height="126">Rising Demand:</b> Global economic
expansion is driving what
the IEA says is the biggest
increase in oil demand for 24
years. There is higher than
expected demand in industrialised
countries and China’s rapidly
expanding economy has
created a huge demand boost.
Chinese demand is up 20 per
cent over the past year. US
demand has risen because of
strengthening economic recovery
and greater need for higher
grade crude oil suitable for
processing into petrol (gasoline)
for the fuel-hungry SUVs.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Low Stocks:</b> Oil companies have tried to become more efficient in recent years 
and
operate with lower stocks of crude oil. This means there is less of a cushion in 
the
market against supply interruptions. Events such as violence in the Middle East,
ethnic tension in Nigeria and strikes in Venezuela have had a greater effect on
prices in the past year than might have been the case if stock levels were 
higher.
</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>OPEC Strategy:</b> The oil producers’ organisation accounts for about half of the
world’s crude oil exports and attempts to keep prices roughly where it wants 
them
by trimming or lifting supplies to the market. In the past, OPEC ministers 
tended
to wait for prices to dip before agreeing to cut output. But OPEC is now acting 
more
aggressively, announcing production cuts to pre-empt any weakening in prices.
International oil companies traditionally used times of seasonally weaker 
demand,
when prices were lower, to rebuild stocks. These windows now appear to have
been closed. Data error is an additional factor, some analysts say. Consumption
forecasts by market experts turned out to be too low. The result was that 
producers
kept supplies even tighter than was needed to prevent rebuilding of stocks.
            </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Action of Speculators: 
            </b>The combination of low stocks and OPEC action to keep
them low leaves the market exposed to the prospect of sudden price rises if 
supplies
are threatened. This has not gone unnoticed by professional market speculators.
Hedge funds and other speculators betting on the possibility of higher prices
have themselves exacerbated price pressure in the market.
</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Violence in the Middle East:</b> The world’s major oil consumers remain dependent
on the Middle East for their oil. Recent violence in Iraq and Saudi Arabia has
again raised fears about an interruption to supplies. Iraqi exports were cut by 
sabotage
attacks on oil facilities. Attacks on foreign workers in Saudi Arabia by Al- Qaeda-inspired militants have also increased tensions. Any substantial attack on
Saudi oil facilities would be a major event for world oil markets.
</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Other Political Tension:</b> Analysts also view political tension in non-Middle East
states such as Nigeria and Venezuela as having the potential to disrupt exports 
and
drive up world prices. The August price rises also followed signs that a dispute
between the Russia’s government and biggest oil company, Yukos, would lead to
the shutdown of much of the company’s production.</font></p>

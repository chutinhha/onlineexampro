            <font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>

            <b>By Ken Blanchard &amp; Sheldon Bowles </b><br>
            HarperCollins <br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">No. It is not a 
            study of football hooliganism in Europe. It is a charming tale of 
            management wisdom that touches upon one of the modern mantras of 
            management gurus - customer service. Co-authored by Ken Blanchard 
            (The One-Minute Manager) and Sheldon Bowles, Raving Fans! is truly 
            one of the most concise self-help books I have read in recent times 
            (@ 132 pages across two evenings). Its easy to read style and 
            clarity of message marks a refreshing change from the verbose and 
            sophoric management treatises prevalent today. Using a rather clever 
            storyline of a modern day fable, the authors deliver three simple 
            rules for outstanding customer service. Placed in a new and 
            unenviable position as the Area Manager, our nameless hero receives 
            the unexpected help of an imaginative character - Charlie, the fairy 
            godmother who unveils the three 'magic secrets' to creating ' Raving 
            Fans' of customers. These secrets centre around well known rules: 
            (a) Create a vision of a perfect organisation - Decide (b) 
            Understand what your customer really wants - Discover (c) Institute 
            effective systems to deliver consistently better customer service - 
            Deliver While these truths are familiar and oft repeated in every 
            work on customer service, the innovative presentation of these rules 
            makes the book memorable. Placing them in everyday situations 
            enables the reader to appreciate that understanding and implementing 
            better customer service is a universal opportunity for every 
            organisation. To illustrate this, the authors help the hero gain 
            wisdom from a diverse range of Charlie's previous beneficiaries - 
            from large retailers to gas stations and even cab drivers. While the 
            style of the book is fun and light-hearted, the message is critical 
            to
            <img border="0" src="im15.jpg" align="right" width="75" height="93">organisations 
            that need great customer service to survive. And like all fables, 
            there's even a 'happily ever after' to this modern day fairytale.

            Managers: Effective Public Relations </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>By Moi Ali </b><br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The phrase - 'good 
            things come in little packages' - certainly applies to this 
            beginners' guide to public relations. Despite its small size, 
            Effective Public Relations offers a reader-friendly insight in the 
            world of Public Relations. I am a big fan of simplicity, as books 
            tend to overcomplicate issues that can lead industry newcomers into 
            a state of confusion. Public Relations is not about using technical 
            marketing jargon in order to score points or appear more 
            experienced. It is predominantly about building relationships and 
            the strategic use of communication tools that are widely available. 
            These tools can then be utilised effectively, using imagination, 
            planning and rigorous implementation. The use of images and simple 
            visual models makes this book a pleasure to read, and the 
            information is easily absorbed. This book focuses on two key 
            elements of PR, namely the media and organising events. It does, 
            however, fail to include any information on other important elements 
            of Public Relations - for example, social investment and sponsorship 
            that can be extremely effective in the omani market. As Effective 
            Public Relations is an international book, some of the suggestions 
            and recommendations are not particularly relevant for PR in the 
            Omani market; however, it still offers an invaluable insight into 
            the industry and provides any budding PR professional with a great 
            foundation to start work. A
            <img border="0" src="im16.jpg" align="right" width="74" height="92">must 
            for any marketing professionals' bookshelf, this handy guide will 
            certainly help provide focus and a clear structure for anyone 
            looking to include strategic PR into their marketing mix. </font>

				<b>The ePayment Gateway promises to revolutionise the way we do 
				transactions. All that we may need is a bank card and a secure 
				Internet connection to buy and sell and pay our phone bills, 
				writes Visvas Paul D Karra</b><br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="tech.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Omanbay, the leading online 
				auction and advertising website in Oman, was having a difficult 
				time in dealing with transactions of the auctions conducted 
				online. The option of members going to pay at the bank was not 
				working very well as the bank cashiers frequently forgot to 
				enter the member’s number into the computer and when the money 
				was paid in, the administrators of the website sometimes didn’t 
				know whom it was from.<br>
				<br>
				All that changed when Omanbay became a partner of the ePayment 
				Gateway (ePG) set up by the Information Technology Authority (ITA) 
				– the government organisation spearheading the e-Government 
				initiatives. Using a credit card, members of Omanbay, can now 
				pay online and the administrators of the website need not check 
				the bank account daily as the money goes directly into member’s 
				accounts.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Fingertip convenience</b><br>
				All companies which have joined the ePG are now having a whole 
				lot of satisfied customers who pay their bills or do online 
				transactions conveniently from their home or office. Although 
				the ePG is yet to catch up in a big way among the public, the 
				fact that companies like Oman Mobile and Nawras are already 
				partners in the ePG should be a great incentive to pay bills 
				online. For example, the ePG can be used by individuals for 
				paying ROP fines and payments to the ministry of manpower. The 
				ministry of sports affairs is also selling the GCC Cup 2009 
				tickets online.<br>
				<br>
				The provision of electronic payments (e-Payment) and in 
				particular Internet payments was identified as a critical shared 
				service in the Omani e-Government architecture and served as a 
				main enabler to the online delivery of government services. The 
				ITA has been working on the ePG since April 2007 in close 
				cooperation with MasterCard and BankMuscat to offer e-commerce 
				facilities for merchants. The main goal of the ePG is to provide 
				a mechanism to handle the online payment for goods and services 
				offered by the government as well as other commercial entities 
				and promote e-commerce in the country.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="tech2.jpg" width="289" height="236" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">According to Muhanna Baqer, manager ePayments, ITA, who is 
				incharge for this prestigious project, at the moment, the ePG 
				enables not only government-to-government transactions but also 
				enables individuals and commercial organisations to do 
				transactions online with the government. “Continuing further 
				Baqer says, “Every process has an evolution and as people become 
				e-savvy and realise the benefits of sitting in the comfort of 
				their homes or office and doing transactions like ordering 
				luxury goods or paying their utility bills then ePG will become 
				popular and objectives will be achieved.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>A wider net</b><br>
				The ePG is part of eOman initiative launched by the government 
				of Oman to make the country a digital society wherein a master 
				portal will link all government and private entities to each 
				other as well as to the public to conduct online business. The 
				presence of a robust and secure ePG enables e-government shared 
				services to be paid for electronically using major local and 
				international credit and debit cards, and in future, other 
				electronic payment instruments.<br>
				<br>
				However, local banks, wary of allowing debit cards for their 
				online transactions due to security reasons, have come up with 
				their own cards under the garb of various names like pre-paid 
				cards, internet cards which can be used exclusively for web 
				payments. Talking about the benefits for Omanbay after joining 
				ePG, Mustafa Ali Mohammed of Tala United says: “Paying online is 
				automatic and the money is paid into the member’s account 
				immediately and so he can go ahead and place his listings on the 
				homepage immediately, even on a Friday, or in the middle of the 
				night. Since Omanbay is mainly used by people at home in their 
				leisure time the fact that they can pay us 24 hours a day seven 
				days a week is very useful, both for us and for them.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Safe and secure</b><br>
				The ePG allows secure transfer of funds via the Internet, for 
				online shopping of services or goods as it is built on 
				MasterCard Internet Gateway Services (MIGS). A payment server 
				acquires e-payment and seeks an authorisation of payment from 
				the customer’s bank and facilitates customer’s bank to transfer 
				funds to the merchant’s acquiring bank. ePG provides payment 
				services for e-commerce and e-government as the gateway accepts 
				all international credit cards, debit cards including Visa, 
				MasterCard, Amex and Diner cards. It also supports various 
				electronic channels including Internet, mobile phone, IVR, call 
				centre. Users need not worry as the gateway is reliable, secure 
				and future proof with payment card industry standards. Since the 
				soft launch of the ePG in mid March this year, the Ministry of 
				Sports Affairs, Oman Mobile, Nawras, ROP, BankMuscat and OmanBay 
				are the current members of the system. “In five months, more 
				than 3300 transactions took place successfully over the ePG and 
				the customers’ reaction so far has been very positive without 
				even a single complaint from the members or their customers,” 
				Baqer informs while speaking about the operations.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Partners speak</b><br>
				“Oman Mobile was the first to sign the e-payment portal 
				agreement with the ITA. This is based on our efforts and vision 
				to form a link between the private and public sector for a 
				variety of services that benefit our customers. And it has been 
				in accordance with supporting the government’s strategy in 
				adopting the efforts and projects of eOman and eGoverment,” says 
				Zuwaina bint Sultan Al Rashdi, Branding &amp; Market Communications 
				Manager. “Joining the ePG has created an awareness at Oman 
				Mobile of how much in demand these particular types of services 
				are and it has provided us with the incentive to offer more 
				services to our customers in the near future and to focus more 
				efforts on electronic services which will make life easier and 
				more comfortable for them,” says Al Rashdi.<br>
				<br>
				Nawras, the second mobile services provider in the Sultanate, 
				has also joined the ePG to bring more benefits and services to 
				its customers both prepaid (Mousbak) as well as postpaid (Ajel). 
				Nawras is offering the ePG services through MyNawras, an 
				exclusive and highly convenient self-care facility available to 
				all its customers on its website.<br>
				<br>
				“The Internet payment services is part of the convenient bill 
				payment channels that have been created by Nawras to bring ease 
				and convenience to its customers. These payment channels range 
				from Nawras Stores, banks, ATMs etc. The ePG is actually 
				bringing in more payment channels for our customers,” says 
				Nash’at Ahmed Al Riyami, product manager, who is incharge of the 
				e-payment portal project at Nawras. “At the end of the day, for 
				Nawras, it is all about providing a better customer experience. 
				It improves our relationship with our customers and there has 
				been a great response to our Internet bill payment services. The 
				e-payment services also helps us to focus on finding more 
				innovative methods to sell our services to the people,” Al 
				Riyami adds.<br>
				<br>
				Summing up the ePG benefits, Baqer says that there are numerous 
				socio-economic advantages of embracing e-payment services. 
				Private sector entities can join the gateway and can increase 
				their customer base and market with easy payment options. The 
				public can now pay for services and products completely online 
				using any of the major credit/debit cards and the use of gateway 
				is free for buyers. No longer do they need to visit the physical 
				offices or wait in long queues to make payments. Eventually, 
				when there are less cars on the roads, there will be less 
				traffic jams, reducing pollution and also reducing stress-levels 
				of people because they do not have to worry about finding 
				parking space to pay their bills. The ePG will also allows Omani 
				merchants to sell their products and services on the Internet to 
				customers worldwide and customers in Oman could continue to 
				purchase products and services from any part of the world on the 
				Internet and pay for them online as well. </font></p>

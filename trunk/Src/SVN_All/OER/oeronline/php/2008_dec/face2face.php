			</strong><strong>Ali Rashid Al-Jarwan, General Manager - Abu Dhabi 
			Marine Operating Company (ADMA-OPCO) and Chairman of the recently 
			held Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition &amp; Conference (ADIPEC) 
			2008 speaks to Jessica Brookes of OER on the sidelines of the 
			conference in Abu Dhabi</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>

			</strong><strong>
			<img border="0" src="face1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="230">How significant a role does ADIPEC play in bringing 
			together the industry?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			It has been proven through the years that ADIPEC is a very important 
			event for the industry. If we take for example this year’s event, 
			the attendance on the first day was 122,000, including 50 CEOs from 
			the majors and national oil companies. So it is a very important 
			event. We have about 1,550 companies exhibiting their latest 
			equipment, technology and methods. It is an excellent forum for 
			networking to capture best practices, exchanging information, 
			developing a network within the industry. At the same time it is an 
			opportunity for professionals in the industry to see the exhibitors, 
			available trends, applications and what possible solutions are 
			available.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>How does the conference compare to previous years?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			This year we have experienced growth across all areas. The 
			exhibition has grown 100 per cent in size compared to the last 
			ADIPEC held in 2006. In the conference section we have grown 
			approximately 70 per cent. The quality of the conference and the 
			exhibition has also improved each year. The first ADIPEC was held in 
			1984 and formed by professionals from ADNOC and members of the 
			Society for Petroleum engineers. By 1992 we had achieved our goal of 
			being the most competitive conference and exhibition in the region 
			within the 10-year period that we had set for ourselves. As a 
			world-class event we attract the attention of thousands of 
			professionals and industry managers. This year alone 800 papers were 
			submitted of which we selected only 200 papers. It is this choice 
			that leads to credibility within the industry.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>Take us through the modalities of the selection 
			process?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			Two years ago we established a new organising committee and an 
			exhibition committee. These were supposed to co-ordinate and put 
			strategies in place for the event. The executive committee for this 
			year’s event consists of the top industry experts who are supported 
			by specialised technical committees. The combined expertise of all 
			involved ensures that we selected only the highest quality of papers 
			that demonstrate the latest technologies, and best industry practice 
			and approaches used to enhance industry performance. As a team we 
			formulate the theme which is then used as the criteria for paper 
			submission. The 2008 theme, “Working Together to Deliver Sustainable 
			Growth: Innovative Teams and Technology Deployment”, was chosen for 
			its timely relevance as the industry is faced with increased demand 
			for energy. By holding such an event we hope to addresses such major 
			challenges and issues that confront the energy sector.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>The role of international oil companies (IOCs) and 
			national oil companies (NOCs) is a hot topic at this year’s event. 
			How important is industry collaboration?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			</strong><strong>
			<img border="0" src="face2.jpg" width="250" height="142" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"></strong><strong style="font-weight: 400">Not only is the event itself a platform for this, by bringing 
			together a vast range of industry professionals from both NOCs and 
			IOCs, but it also gives companies the chance to discuss future role 
			of collaboration and how to best achieve this. The industry now more 
			than ever is realising the need for closer collaboration. 
			Collaboration needs to occur both with the company itself and with 
			outside companies and organisations. I see these collaborations as 
			being the way forward for the industry. The international oil 
			companies have a lot of excellent experience and they are result 
			oriented. National oil companies also have very skilled workforces 
			with the local knowledge and know-how and have targets to achieve, 
			so drawing together the key strengths of both NOC and IOCs can only 
			add value and strengthen the industry.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>Given the global financial crisis what do you 
			believe is the way forward?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			We are still speculating and observing the market. We don’t know the 
			extent of this economic crisis, and nobody knows what will happen in 
			the short-to-medium-term. Most oil activities are related to the 
			long-term, and I believe that we should not let the recent events 
			dissuade us from the long term vision and targets we already have in 
			place to achieve production in order meet the world demand for 
			supply.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>
			<img border="0" src="face3.jpg" width="316" height="137" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">What needs to be done to address the skill shortage 
			in the industry?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			More emphasis needs to be placed on education starting not just from 
			university levels but at high school also. There should be more 
			alignment with the industry, what the industry requires and where it 
			is heading. We need to focus on education – on the fundamentals of 
			physics, chemistry and mathematics, and actively engage students in 
			the industry. It is also vital that we prepare them from the very 
			beginning of their education to manage changes, because the industry 
			is changing everyday right before our eyes.<br>
			<br>
			</strong><strong>How important is the role of alternative energies 
			in the energy supply equation?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
			It is very important that is why the industry requires all types of 
			disciplines, all types of engineers and science fundamentals. I 
			think the industry altogether from the wider scope of energy will 
			take a wider spectrum of future energy requirement. The oil and gas 
			industry will continue to have a major role for many years to come 
			but we will require versatile engineers who know about the new 
			technologies and alternative energy sources to ensure that they can 
			deal with the future demand. All this, will ensure efficiency and 
			better operation, sustainable production and maybe even higher 
			recovery of oil and gas. </strong></font></p>

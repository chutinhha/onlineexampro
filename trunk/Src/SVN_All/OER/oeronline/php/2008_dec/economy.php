				<img border="0" src="economy.jpg" width="125" height="148" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman’s fast-growing banking sector looks strongly placed to 
				withstand the pressures of the global financial turmoil. 
				However, while local banks have little direct exposure to toxic 
				assets, tighter liquidity and lower economic growth are likely 
				to impact banks to some extent. The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) 
				has therefore made sensible moves to bolster short-term 
				confidence.<br>
				<br>
				Banking results from the first nine months of 2008 paint the 
				picture of a very dynamic sector. The profits of Oman’s six 
				listed banks rose 37.6 per cent. As a report by Kuwait’s Global 
				Investment House noted, this performance was particularly 
				impressive given the shakedown that several Gulf financial 
				institutions have undergone over recent months. Global praised 
				the “commendable” performance, noting that while “some of the 
				major regional banks in the GCC registered a decline in 
				profits,” no Oman-based lender saw profit growth dip below 
				double figures.”<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="eco.jpg" width="150" height="331" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">These are tough times for the global financial system as a 
				whole. The international credit crunch, which commenced more 
				than a year ago with a range of banks announcing large 
				write-downs attributed to sub-prime mortgage loans and 
				associated products, entered a new and dramatic phase this 
				autumn. With banks in North America and Europe folding or at 
				imminent risk of collapse, governments have stepped in with huge 
				“bail out” packages designed to inject new liquidity into their 
				financial systems and underwrite debts – in some cases, 
				resorting to partial nationalisation.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Contagion effect<br>
				</b>The effects of the crisis may have started to spread to GCC 
				member states. On October 26, Kuwait’s Central Bank moved to 
				halt trading of shares in Gulf Bank, one of the country’s 
				largest lenders. Two days later, the Kuwait government announced 
				that it was ready to invest in a proposed capital increase for 
				Gulf Bank designed to keep the lender afloat and passed a law 
				extending deposit guarantees – the latter policy designed to 
				shore up savers and therefore confidence in the banking system. 
				The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) recently injected $3bn 
				into the domestic banking system, ostensibly to ease borrowing 
				conditions for the poor.<br>
				<br>
				While Gulf Bank has been the only major incidence of a bank 
				requiring the deployment of rescue policies, the Gulf‘s overall 
				financial sector has been somewhat shaken by falling stock 
				markets, partly connected to fears that what many have seen as a 
				real estate bubble might burst. Business confidence is 
				declining, and should this creeping pessimism beset the banking 
				system, the Gulf‘s thriving economies could be in real trouble.<br>
				<br>
				Even without direct exposure to the toxic assets associated with 
				the crisis elsewhere, Gulf banks -including Oman‘s - face a 
				number of pressures from the global credit crunch and related 
				circumstances. Firstly, they may find it harder to raise capital 
				to expand, as international lenders become more wary of 
				extending loans, and interbank borrowing becomes more expensive. 
				They may also feel some of the effects of the economic slowdown 
				currently affecting the global economy, including more sluggish 
				deposit growth and, possibly, an increase in defaults. This 
				seems likely to temper bank’s growth, which is closely linked to 
				that of the economy as a whole.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Confident stance</b><br>
				However, the GGC states’ governments and central bankers remain 
				confident that their banks are robust, relatively underexposed 
				to the crisis, and flush with liquidity. The chairman of the 
				SAMA has dispelled rumours that the Kingdom will push banks to 
				merge in order that they might better withstand the financial 
				storms, stating that there is ample liquidity in the system. His 
				comments have been echoed by counterparts in other Gulf 
				countries, including Qatar and Oman.<br>
				<br>
				On October 21, CBO executive president HE Hamood Sangour Al 
				Zadjali stated that, “The banking system in Oman is quite 
				resilient and strong, with no exposure to the US mortgage 
				markets,” adding that banks in Oman are “sound and well 
				capitalised.” According to HE Zadjali, banks’ core capital and 
				reserves total $4bn, while interbank lending rates – a key 
				measure of the ease with which liquidity moves around the 
				financial system – were below two per cent in October, down from 
				2.6 per cent in the same month of 2007. Commercial banks have 
				ample access to cash through the CBO.<br>
				<br>
				Nonetheless, the central bank is wisely taking a cautious stance 
				on the crisis. It has opted to delay the tightening of the 
				loan-to-deposit ratio scheduled for November 2008. This move was 
				planned to constrict liquidity (with the end aim of slowing 
				inflation) by decreasing the proportion of deposits that can be 
				lent out from 85 per cent to 82.5 per cent. This should help 
				prevent credit from drying up as it has elsewhere. While there 
				is little immediate scope for actually increasing the ration, 
				given the fact that inflation hit 13.7 per cent in August, the 
				easing of inflationary pressures seems likely to provide more 
				possibilities for a relaxation of monetary policy in 2009 should 
				the necessity arise.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Slow but steady<br>
				<img border="0" src="economy1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"></b>In practice, the CBO does not have the key monetary lever – 
				interest rates – at its disposal due to the rial’s dollar peg. 
				It is effectively obliged to track US Federal Reserve policy; 
				for the first time in several years, the Fed’s moves to cut 
				rates may in fact fit with Oman’s needs, by making money 
				cheaper, easing pressure on indebted businesses and households, 
				and bolstering consumer confidence. Ensuring that banks still 
				have ample access to liquidity is important as deposit growth 
				moderates and external credit dries up. It should also allow 
				continued expansion of one of the newer markets for banks – 
				financing small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are an 
				important, if somewhat overlooked, part of Oman’s 
				diversification drive.<br>
				<br>
				Over the medium term, it is not only the credit crunch (and its 
				effects of lower economic growth and commodity prices) that 
				seems likely to slow banks’ expansion. The relatively young 
				Omani banking market will near saturation in the coming years. 
				Furthermore, somewhat tighter monetary policy may be required in 
				order to head off inflationary spikes to which Oman is 
				vulnerable, and to prevent excessive credit expansion that could 
				threaten economic stability in the event of a downturn. After 
				all, one of the key causes of the credit crisis was 
				overenthusiastic borrowing and lending. Somewhat slower growth 
				is therefore the likely outcome of a maturing market and 
				cautious oversight – positive trends for the industry. In the 
				short-to-medium-term, the likeliest course for banks in Oman is 
				more sedately but steadily ahead. </font></p>

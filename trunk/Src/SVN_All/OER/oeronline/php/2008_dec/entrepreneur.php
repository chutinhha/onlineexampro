				<img border="0" src="entra.jpg" width="337" height="212" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">To 
				be or not to be that is the question” said Eng Mohammed al 
				Busaidi (a founder member of Muscat Sports) recalls Ahmed Salim 
				al Busaidy, managing director, Muscat Sports. The year was 1994 
				and the company faced the choice of either moving up a few 
				notches by opening an outlet at the Al Araimi complex at a steep 
				investment of RO50,000 or to continue being a marginal player in 
				the business. The Shakespearean soliloquy worked wonders as the 
				management decided to take the plunge. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Moving up in business</b><br>
				Muscat Sports opened an outlet in the Al Araimi complex, 
				spending an additional RO11,000 (apart from rent) on furnishing 
				the shop. Says Mohammed, “The decision proved to be a turning 
				point for Muscat Sports.” The new found visibility of Muscat 
				Sports helped it to introduce a number of international brands 
				like Reebok, Speedo, Puma, Stingray, Umbro, New Balance, Lotto, 
				Asics etc to its customers. This helped the company to move a 
				few steps closer to its goal of becoming a leading sports 
				merchandising company in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				It proved to be a quantum leap for a company which started off 
				in 1990 in a 75 sq feet shop in Hamriya, Muscat with a seed 
				capital of RO6,000. Realising the importance of being in a high 
				profile location, Muscat Sports opened up another retail outlet 
				at Markaz al Bahja in 2004. As the city shifted towards Seeb, it 
				made commercial sense to have a store in the vicinity of that 
				area. The store proved to be a success from day one. Muscat 
				Sports is giving final touches to an agreement with Safeer 
				hypermarket to open a store in the mall soon. Says Ahmed, “It is 
				a good area with no sports stores in the vicinity. We are 
				opening up a small store in the hypermarket.” The chain covers 
				the entire Muscat area with its three stores in Al Araimi, 
				Markaz al Bahja and Ruwi.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from these, it is also a wholesale supplier of various 
				brands like Puma, Speedo, Stingray etc to hypermarkets like LuLu, 
				Carrefour, Sultan Centre, Safeer Hypermarket etc. Muscat Sports 
				also supplies merchandise to sports shops in Salalah, Sur and 
				Sohar. “We choose people who have a good set up,” says Ahmed. 
				Thus the chain has managed to create a pan Oman footprint for 
				itself. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Stellar brands<br>
				</b>The acquisition of major brands has been another important 
				reason for its success. Muscat Sports is the exclusive 
				distributor of most of the brands mentioned above (except 
				Reebok). In 2005, it became the sole distributor of Techno-gym – 
				the second biggest gym equipment company in the world and the 
				number one company in this category in Europe. To service its 
				customers better it floated a new company called Sports 
				Solutions in 2007 which takes care of the Techno-gym brand. The 
				company has done up the gyms of hotels like the Al Bustan 
				Palace, The Chedi, Sheraton, Park Inn etc. Rising consciousness 
				about fitness is encouraging people to install fitness 
				equipments in their houses. The cost of a gym can range anywhere 
				from RO10,000 to RO200,000.<br>
				<br>
				In a business where distributors get changed every few years, it 
				is a testimony to Muscat Sports strengths that it has managed to 
				hold onto its brands for years. Almost every brand that the 
				company acquired has remained with it. Says Ahmed, “In Dubai for 
				instance Middle East agents for sports brands change every 2-3 
				years but all our brands have remained with us from the 
				beginning because we make a special effort to service them.”<br>
				<br>
				Muscat Sports floated its own in-house brand called Marma in 
				2006. The company makes T-shirts, shorts, footballs and sports 
				wear under the brand name. The company supplies these to local 
				football clubs like Habourah, Fanja, Nizwa, Ahli, Sidab, Dhofar 
				etc apart from selling it in its outlets. As each of these clubs 
				use their individual colours and change T-shirt designs 
				frequently, it is a challenge to keep up with them. An in-house 
				brand like Marma helps Muscat Sports to take better care of 
				these changing mores. The lack of an intermediary agent keeps 
				costs down making it more acceptable to local clubs.<br>
				<br>
				Though Marma may be a shade cheaper than established 
				international brands, the company keeps a strict tab on its 
				quality standards. Says Mohammed, “We use China and Taiwan as 
				our manufacturing base as the cost of labour in these markets is 
				low, but we constantly travel to these units to ensure that 
				there is no compromise on the quality standards.”<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="entra1.jpg" width="175" height="283" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The 
				company entered into an agreement with Oman Football Association 
				(OFA) in 2006 as its sole supplier for the next three years. 
				Muscat Sports provides all the requirements of the Oman Football 
				team like T-shirts, shoes, gloves etc free of cost. The 
				agreement gives Muscat Sports the right to use the Oman football 
				team’s logo on T-shirts and to sell them. The company sees this 
				as an important brand building activity and a contribution to 
				the national team.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Success mantra<br>
				</b>The company which started with four people (three Busaidi 
				brothers and an employee) is today a 60-strong organisation. 
				Looking back Mohammed feels that there have been few important 
				reasons their success. Having grown up playing sports the 
				Busaidi brothers have a first hand knowledge of the sporting 
				requirements of clubs and sportsmen. Mohammed was a handball 
				player, Zoher al Busaidi his elder brother is the assistant 
				coach of the national football team, while their younger brother 
				Said al Busaidi was felicitated as the best football player 
				during his hey days. “If we started a business that we did not 
				know about, it would have been difficult for us. Since we 
				started something that we loved it has helped us,” says 
				Mohammed.<br>
				<br>
				Though the company has been through its rough patches like the 
				Muscat Securities crash of 1997, the promoter’s policy of 
				reinvesting their earnings into the business has paid off. 
				Muscat Sports has been making consistent profits since 2004 and 
				expects to continue growing in the coming years. “It is 
				important to have patience in a business, one should not look at 
				making a fast buck. We never withdraw money from the company and 
				have always been ready to inject more if needed,” says Ahmed. 
				Such single minded focus has meant that Muscat Sports has never 
				had to go back to dilemma’s like ‘to be or not to be’ ever 
				again.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

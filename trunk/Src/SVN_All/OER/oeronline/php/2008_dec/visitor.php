				<b>Samsonite’s positioning as a luxury lifestyle brand has 
				helped it graduate from being a commodity to an aspiration. 
				Mayank Singh reports<br>
				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="visitor.jpg" width="250" height="359" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The 
				company is working on its forthcoming spring-summer collection 
				and expectations are that it will better its colour range – if 
				you thought that we talking about the next haute couture line 
				from a major fashion house let me correct you. We are actually 
				alluding to the next season’s travel gear line-up from Samsonite. 
				Says Subrata Dutta, COO, Samsonite South Asia, “In 2004 we 
				realised that the time to sell travel gear had stopped and we 
				needed to position Samsonite as a lifestyle brand rather than a 
				commodity.” The idea was backed by research which proved that 
				over the last decade ‘travellers had started flaunting what they 
				carried’ – a fashion statement on the move. To market the brand 
				as a luxury created the need for exclusive Samsonite retail 
				stores.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Retail is the key</b><br>
				Today, close to 70 per cent of the company’s $1.3bn sales 
				turnover comes from these eponymous stores. The reasons for this 
				is not far to seek – these stores present the brand in its 
				entire glory – be it the range, colours or features. The fact 
				that such a high proportion of its sale comes from Samsonite 
				exclusive outlets proves the tremendous pull of the brand. 
				According to a study, Samsonite has one of the highest unaided 
				recalls for any brand in the world. Samsonite is taking the 
				retail model a step forward by having exclusive outlets for one 
				of its best selling brands – Samsonite Black Label. In Muscat 
				the upcoming Samsonite store in Madinat as Sultan Qaboos will be 
				an exclusive Black Label shop. Samsonite has a retail store at 
				the City Centre in Seeb and the Khimji Mega Store in Ruwi. A 
				fourth store is under construction at Qurum.<br>
				<br>
				The positioning of a luggage as a lifestyle proposition gives 
				rise to its own set of challenges. Says Dutta, “It is essential 
				to constantly refresh these retail stores so that customer 
				fatigue does not set in.” Thus these stores sport a new format 
				every two-to-three years. The product portfolio too gets 
				constantly updated – displaying the chic and discarding the 
				dated.<br>
				<br>
				Though the effort may seem to be Herculean for others, for a 
				company like Samsonite, innovation is akin to second nature. 
				Talk of any innovation in the luggage space and chances are that 
				Samsonite pioneered it. It was the first to introduce a suitcase 
				on wheels, the first to come up with a spinner on wheels and the 
				first to usher in suitcases with brakes.<br>
				<br>
				Its luxury positioning is embellished by the use of modern day 
				icons as brand ambassadors. Sir Richard Branson, chairman, 
				Virgin Group endorses Black Label while actress Ingrid Bergman’s 
				daughter Isabella Rosselini is the ambassador for Samsonite 
				Black Label Vintage Collection.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tapping the mass market</b><br>
				If Samsonite is for the well-heeled traveller, American 
				Tourister, the other brand in the company’s repertoire is 
				positioned as a suitcase suited for the needs of the family. 
				Says Dutta, “Samsonite is more style oriented, while American 
				Tourister is feature driven.”<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="visitor1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Keeping 
				functionality in view these suitcases come with a lot of space. 
				They can further be expanded by another 10 per cent of the total 
				capacity if needed. American Tourister bags are equipped with 
				Travel Security Authority (TSA) locks, which can be opened by 
				security agencies. The functionality of American Tourister is 
				proving to be a major draw for the brand. The brand’s turnover 
				has been doubling every two years. In countries like China, 
				Japan and India it contributes to 30 per cent of Samsonite’s 
				turnover. Unlike Samsonite which is distributed through 
				Samsonite outlets, American Tourister is sold in shop-in-shops. 
				This gives customers a chance to compare the product with its 
				competitors like Delphi etc.<br>
				<br>
				Around 60 per cent of the brand’s customers are males, while the 
				remaining 40 per cent are women. In an effort to attract more 
				women, Samsonite has introduced an exclusive range for women 
				called Samsonite Pro-DLX. The company has also launched a new 
				collection of suitcases called Aeirs. The Aiers range comes in 
				seven rainbow colours. An added advantage of having a 
				distinctively colorful bag is that it can be spotted easily on a 
				conveyor belt.<br>
				<br>
				In another significant shift, there seems to be a growing 
				preference for soft bags. “They feel more stylish and give a 
				softer feeling,” says Dutta. Close to 70 per cent of Samsonite 
				bags sold are soft and the remaining 30 per cent is hard 
				luggage. To make its hard bags more attractive, Samsonite has 
				recently introduced Cosmolight – the lightest suitcase in the 
				world. Samsonite has its manufacturing facilities in Oudenaarde 
				in Belgium and Nasik in India. The company also uses a number of 
				third party manufacturers to make its products. The company has 
				a licensed agreement with Timberland and Lacoste to market their 
				bags worldwide.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Power markets</b><br>
				Samsonite sees the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and 
				China as its growth drivers. In addition to these are the Middle 
				East Markets which are categorised as power markets. In all 
				these markets the company has been experiencing a 10 percentage 
				points higher growth than the global average of 12 per cent, 
				that Samsonite has witnessed over the last three years.<br>
				<br>
				In Oman the company sees a lot of potential for the American 
				Tourister brand. Says Dutta, “The Sultanate’s growth has been 
				steady and since it is a country which has strong social ties 
				(leading to a lot of travel) by extrapolation there are a lot of 
				opportunities for us.” The company is also targeting 
				institutional sales segment as it feels that it gives 
				credibility to its products. Samsonite is a supplier to Oman 
				Air.<br>
				<br>
				The establishment of a logistics centre at Dubai in 2006 has 
				helped to improve the supply chain management for Oman 
				immensely. Says Vivek Pande, CEO, Life Style Group, Khimji 
				Ramdas (Samsonite’s partner in the Sultanate), “The logistics 
				centre has been a huge advantage for us as we can procure 
				merchandise in a day’s time now against the two-and-half to 
				three month wait that we had to endure earlier when we got 
				deliveries from Belgium.”<br>
				<br>
				While the company is keeping a keen eye on the financial 
				meltdown it is confident of coming off it pretty much unscathed. 
				“We believe that the meltdown will affect the bottom-end of the 
				market more than the top-end of the market. As we are a 
				high-premium product our customers will still come back to us,” 
				says Dutta. After all, luxury never goes out of fashion. </font>

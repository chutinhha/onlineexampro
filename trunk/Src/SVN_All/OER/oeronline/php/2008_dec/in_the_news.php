			<img border="0" src="news1.jpg" align="left">National Training Institute (NTI) announced the commencement of 
			enrolments for 2009 NTI BizPro Awards which have now come to be 
			coveted as hallmarks of Omani excellence for business and executive 
			competence. The awards are instituted by NTI to recognise and 
			celebrate the accomplishments of Omanis who have contributed 
			significantly to the economy of Oman. Feedback, from the Omani 
			executive world specifically, has indicated that there is much 
			appreciation of NTI’s intent, and the BizPro Awards event is one 
			that people want to get associated with.<br>
			<br>
			In 2009, one Business Leader award will be conferred on an Omani 
			businesswoman. There is a separate award in the men’s category. In 
			the Young Achiever segment, three Omani awardees will be nominated. 
			All the prizes are sponsored by Renaissance Services, which has 
			always subscribed to ethical corporate governance, excellence in 
			business, and encouraged empowerment and the peaking of individual 
			competence.<br>
			<br>
			The voluntary participation of the renowned KPMG organisation in 
			Oman as evaluators of candidates is a special feature of the 2009 
			BizPro Awards. KMPG is known for its professional status in audit &amp; 
			business consultancy, and its involvement will assure candidates of 
			even greater transparency in the evaluation process.<br>
			<br>
			National Training Institute (NTI), the leading education and 
			training institution in Oman said the evaluation process has 
			started, wherein candidates will be chosen for the five best Omani 
			Business Leaders &amp; Young Achievers. In 2008, good corporate level 
			participation was seen. 2009 promises even more enthusiasm, as the 
			NTI BizPro Awards have drawn much appreciation from the entire 
			business community in the Sultanate for pioneering 
			conceptualisation.<br>
			<br>
			Over the years the NTI BizPro awards have been able to inspire 
			industry people treading the way towards establishing themselves as 
			business pioneers. NTI’s BizPro Awards has paved the way to 
			recognise talented Omanis who have the innate ability to steer the 
			business world. The Awards also aim to develop and encourage 
			leadership and life skills in young Omanis, develop a sense of pride 
			in being an Omani, and provide role models and mentors for youth by 
			highlighting their achievements and the pursuit of excellence. <br>
			<br>
			NTI BizPro Awards endeavour to become a showcase event, with 
			increased levels of participation from highly competent candidates 
			from the corporate world in Oman. The selection criteria are 
			methodical, and the 2009 Awards promise a leap forward in qualifying 
			standards. The final winners will be solely recommended by the KPMG 
			Team. The Business Leader Award carries a scholarship of RO5,000, 
			while each of the Young Achievers will receive a scholarship of 
			RO2,500.<br>
			<br>
			NTI – a part of the Education and Training Group of Renaissance 
			Services, is synonymous with quality training in Oman. Today NTI, 
			provides high quality training solutions in HSE, technical, IT 
			business skills and financial studies, and specialises in developing 
			indigenous workforce. The initiative to identify unique and 
			outstanding talent hidden in Oman, by NTI BizPro, has set a stage to 
			diversify professional excellence. NTI is once again gearing up to 
			set a similar stage for brilliance in pro-fessionalism.

						<b>
			You are launching this project amidst a global slowdown. Your 
			comments.</b><br>
			Our project is based on fundamentals, not on sentiment so we are 
			aware of the sentiment in the market today. But I don’t think that 
			sentiment has got much of a bearing in Muscat where property 
			development is not on such a massive scale where it warrants a 
			negative sentiment. And I think that this is borne out by the fact 
			that our project is being financed by the banks, there is a mortgage 
			package, a consumer finance package as well as a construction loan 
			package to our company. The project fundamentals are so strong that 
			it is a value proposition which will stand the test of time.<br>

			Our partnership with OHI began in the summer of 2007 resulting in Al 
			Qurum Properties and our first project is ‘Qaryat Qurum’. We have 
			taken almost one year to design this project. It is a master 
			community and we have made sure we come up with something which is 
			unique in Muscat.<br>

			</font><b>
			<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is 
			the project value?</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
			The gross development value of Qaryat Qurum project is about 3.8 mn 
			sq ft of development so in all phases put together we are looking at 
			around RO600mn. We are looking at a 3 phased development – 2 phases 
			of residential and one phase of commercial. So I think our initial 
			equity requirement would be around RO45mn.<br>

						<br>
						<b>Name the project components<br>
						</b>There are four components to this project.We have commercial, 
			residential, retail and hospitality. We will be having a 150-room 
			four star hotel and also serviced apartments as well, besides 
			commercial offices and a shopping centre as well. There will be 900 
			apartments in all categories.<br>

				releases in the world of automobiles. Couple these with some of 
				the best releases from last year and we end up with one of the 
				best selection of cars on sale ever. Of these, sports cars are 
				easily the most coveted. <br>
				<br>
				They are a symbol of power, performance, style and also, to a 
				certain degree, the owners taste. So, this being a list of only 
				the top ten sports cars, we were forced to follow a strict set 
				of parameters. The first of these parameters was that only 
				sports cars (coupes or cabrio’s), GT cars and supercars were to 
				be included in the list (No! sports saloons don’t count, so no 
				Jaguar XF SV8 and Audi RS6, although they are amazing cars in 
				their own right). The next was that the cars had to be released 
				or officially put on sale in 2008, unfortunately this saw a lot 
				of great cars, such as the Audi R8 and the 911 GT3 RS, being 
				dropped from this list. Lastly they had to either be an entirely 
				new model or a significant improvement over the older version, 
				whereby making the previous model all but redundant in 
				comparison.</i></font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Ugobe’s Pleo is the latest ‘electronic pet’ to hit 
				the consumer market. At $350, Pleo is more expensive than a 
				Furby but cheaper than an AIBO. Its endo skeleton has embedded 
				motors in its legs, tail and neck that give it realistic 
				movements. The bottoms of its feet have pressure sensors to 
				detect when it’s on the ground or in the air. It also has two 
				mics that serve as ears, two speakers, light sensors in its nose 
				and mouth, and touch sensors placed all over its body. It also 
				has an SD card slot and a mini-USB port for future functionality 
				upgrades. These motors, sensors and ports combine to make Pleo 
				pleasantly interactive.</font></td>

				love for reading is obvious from the books that make the rounds 
				in social circles. In this land of stunning mountains, sparkling 
				seas and tranquility, books are the best antidote for monotony. 
				And availability of books is no issue with so many book shops 
				around. Virtually every subject under the sun was covered by 
				books that were on display in Muscat International Book Fair 
				held recently. The only thing wanted is opening our minds 
				towards a more contemporary world through contemporary books.</i></font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

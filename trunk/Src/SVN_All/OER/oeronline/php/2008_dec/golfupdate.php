				<b>Arnold Palmer transformed Golf from a pastime to an art form</b><br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="golf.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6">Every sport has one 
				quintessential player who transforms the game from pastime to 
				art form, a person who attracts public attention by presence 
				alone. In the world of golf, this person is Arnold Palmer. 
				Arnold Palmer is many things to many people...world famous golf 
				immortal and sportsman, highly-successful business executive, 
				prominent advertising spokesman, skilled aviator, talented golf 
				course designer and consultant, devoted family patriarch and a 
				man with a down-to-earth common touch that has made him one of 
				the most popular and accessible public figures in history.<br>
				<br>
				His popularity and success grew with the tremendous golf boom in 
				the latter half of the 20th century to heights few ever 
				anticipated and they have been recognised in countless ways over 
				the years. Certainly each contributed to the other, a fact given 
				recognition when he was named as the “Athlete of the Decade,” 
				for the 1960s in a national Associated Press poll. Before, 
				during and after that great decade, the famous golfer amassed 92 
				championships in professional competition of national or 
				international stature. Sixty-two of the victories came on the US 
				PGA Tour, starting with the 1955 Canadian Open.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Endearing Personality</b><br>
				Besides the magnificent performance record, his magnetic 
				personality and unfailing sense of kindness and thoughtfulness 
				to everybody with whom he comes in contact have endeared him to 
				millions throughout the world and led to the informal formation 
				of the largest non-uniformed “military” organization in 
				existence – Arnie’s Army. Seven of his victories came in what 
				the golfing world considers the four major professional 
				championships. He won the Masters Tournament four times, in 
				1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964; the US Open in spectacular fashion in 
				1960 at Cherry Hills Country Club in Denver and the British Open 
				in 1961 and 1962. He came from seven strokes off the pace in the 
				final round in that US Open win and finished second in four 
				other Opens after that.<br>
				<br>
				Palmer’s springboard to professional fame and fortune was his 
				victory in the US Amateur Championship in 1954. He turned 
				professional a few months later. His hottest period was a 
				four-year stretch from 1960 to 1963 when he landed 29 of his 
				titles and collected almost $400,000 at a time when the purses 
				were minute by today’s standards. He was the leading 
				money-winner in three of those years and twice represented the 
				US in the prestigious Ryder Cup Match during that time, serving 
				in 1963 as the victorious captain.<br>
				<br>
				It was also during this period that his rapidly-growing business 
				interests got their start, through the impetus of Palmer himself 
				and with the guidance and efforts of his business manager, the 
				late Mark McCormack, and his wide-ranging organisation. Arnold 
				is president of Arnold Palmer Enterprises, a multi-division 
				structure encompassing much of his commercial activity centered 
				in Cleveland. He has been involved in automobile and aviation 
				service firms over the years and still is the principal owner of 
				a car dealership in his Latrobe (PA) hometown. </font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

				backward integration<br>
				</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Late Sheikh Rashid

				between the Government of Dubai and the BICC group</b><br>

				<img border="0" src="industry.jpg" width="200" height="262" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">In business and industry, companies look for examples of “best 
				practices” when evaluating opportunities for growth and planning 
				strategies for increasing market share. The organisations that 
				go on to become industry leaders must continually seek new 
				benchmarks to reach, and Ducab, based in the United Arab 
				Emirates, has a well-established reputation of setting trends in 
				the power cable manufacturing arena.<br>
				<br>
				In recent years, Ducab has significantly increased output and 
				more than doubled its revenues by adding new facilities, 
				expanding its product line and analysing processes to determine 
				the best areas for cost reduction while maintaining the highest 
				quality output.<br>
				<br>
				“The constant fluctuation in copper prices has become a factor 
				in our overall operation that we took a closer look at,” said 
				Andrew Shaw, managing director of Ducab. “We had already begun 
				controlling the costs of our own raw materials by producing PVC 
				compounding material so the next logical step was to supply our 
				own copper rod, continuing our movement toward backward 
				integration.”<br>
				<br>
				Ducab celebrated the inauguration of its copper rod plant this 
				year ensuring the ongoing supply of high quality copper rod for 
				its own use, with the capacity to increase output to meet 
				growing regional demands as well. In today’s volatile market, 
				this factory will produce high-quality copper rod at a 
				competitive prices, and will add significant benefits to its 
				existing successful cable business.<br>
				<br>
				“In the first month of operation, the copper rod factory 
				exceeded its production goal,” said Samih Zamzam, manufacturing 
				and maintenance manager. “By adding the copper rod plant, our 
				goal is to double our output of cable over last year.” With 
				equipment supplied by SMS Meer of Germany, the Ducab copper rod 
				plant is the first Contirod facility in the UAE. Equipped with 
				the latest generation of manufacturing and testing facilities, 
				the 3,000 square metre plant converts copper cathode into 8mm 
				diameter Electrolytic Touch Pitch (ETP) copper rod.<br>
				<br>
				In the production of copper rod, copper cathode plates are fed 
				into a vertical shaft furnace and melted at 1,250 degrees 
				centigrade into liquid copper, which is conveyed through a 
				holding furnace into a continuous bar casting machine, which 
				transforms liquid copper into solidified rectangular bar. The 
				Ducab copper rod plant features a casting machine manufactured 
				by US-based company Hazelett, which uses the very latest metal 
				casting technology. Once the bar moves into the rolling mill, it 
				is converted into a high quality 8mm rod, which then enters a 
				final cooling and cleaning process, and is coiled onto four 
				tonne pallets before it is finally transported to the three Ducab cable factories. The immediate benefit to Ducab of 
				producing its own copper rod was a significant cost saving in 
				raw materials. Another element of backward integration is the 
				optimisation of the supply chain. Ducab continually seeks ways 
				of streamlining operations, and sometimes upon analysis, it is 
				more efficient to continue using reliable, long-term suppliers 
				rather than bringing a process in-house.<br>
				<br>
				“Ducab had grown to a size that we could justify adding the 
				copper rod plant in an effort to reduce cost of raw materials by 
				going back up the supply chain,” said Simon Baker, Ducab’s 
				supply chain manager. “The purpose of supply chain optimisation 
				is to add value to products and save on costs. The main 
				objective is always to control output quality.” In order to 
				achieve that goal, Ducab requires all materials to meet a set of 
				quality criteria by implementing phased testing for products 
				provided by outside suppliers. “In the first phase, we test 
				technical fit of their product to our products,” said Baker.<br>
				<br>
				According to Baker other optimisation strategies include 
				consignment stocking where materials are held locally in 
				anticipation of future inventory demand, which shortens the 
				supply chain and helps fine tune orders. In addition to this, 
				good communication with suppliers (many of which have been 
				partners since Ducab was established) and a focus on value (more 
				than price) rounds out the strategy.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="industry1.jpg" width="250" height="144" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Expansion of facilities inevitably brings upgrading of 
				equipment, automation of processes and hiring new employees 
				along with training the existing workforce to operate 
				specialised equipment. “The backward integration of our 
				processes really proves our commitment to quality control, 
				ensures cost control, adds value to the local community by 
				keeping jobs here, and is an investment in a UAE company’s 
				growth,” said Shaw. The training was provided by suppliers along 
				with commissioning engineers prior to installation and was then 
				followed by onsite training by specialists. “Along with the new 
				equipment on the floor, the copper rod plant is also outfitted 
				with Maximo, the latest in asset management systems, for 
				tracking all maintenance activities,” said Zamzam. “In addition, 
				we have a state-of-the-art, automated building management system 
				which monitors the facility at all times including the lighting, 
				A/C, compressors, chillers and fire alarm system.” With the 
				construction industry booming in the Middle East and North 
				Africa (MENA) new players are introduced into the market every 
				day. In order to expand market share in an increasingly 
				challenging climate, Ducab seeks creative ways to remain 
				competitive and ultimately reach its goal of becoming the 
				regional leader in cable. The addition of the copper rod plant, 
				and previously the PVC factory, are examples of the company 
				finding unique ways to implement a strategy of backward 
				integration as a cost control measure. This method in itself is 
				not unusual, however, Ducab’s visionary leadership has taken it 
				a step further by employing an in-house financial analyst who 
				reviews costs verses revenues, and constantly calculates the 
				“hedging” position of a potential expansion or acquisition.<br>
				<br>
				Producing the highest quality power cable possible has been 
				Ducab’s mission for almost 30 years, setting the standard for 
				power cable manufacturing in the region. With its systematic and 
				scientific approach to production, quality materials management 
				and customer loyalty, Ducab has achieved the highest industry 
				certifications, the most prestigious management awards, and 
				well-deserved peer recognition. Ducab was the first 
				manufacturing company to be awarded the Emirates Quality Mark 
				Award and was also a recipient of the Investment Corporation of 
				Dubai Chairman’s Award and the Gulf Excellence Award. 
				Continually establishing best practices in the industry, Ducab 
				has obtained product type approval of a range of cables to 
				British Standards by BASEC, and has type test approvals and 
				product quality certifications from KEMA, Lloyds Register, WPB, 
				ERA, BRE and CPRI. In 2001, Ducab became a 100 per cent UAE 
				company, with ownership equally shared between the Governments 
				of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Ducab continues to expand its 
				world-class facilities to meet the growing demand of customers 
				around the region and the world, and now operates from four 
				locations in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.<br>
				<br>
				Ducab’s tailor-made advanced cable solutions have laid the power 
				foundation for world-renowned projects such as the Burj al Arab, 
				Burj Dubai, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai International Airport, Emirates 
				Towers, Emirates Palace Hotel, Oman Culture Center, Kuwait Oil 
				Company and Kuwait National Petroleum Company, Bahrain Financial 
				Harbor, Alba Aluminium Company and numerous other prestigious 
				developments throughout the Middle East and beyond. </font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

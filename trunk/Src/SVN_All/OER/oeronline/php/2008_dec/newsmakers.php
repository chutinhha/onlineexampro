			Abdul Rahman Al Attiyah, GCC Secretary-General was in Muscat 
			recently to address the opening session of a seminar on Gulf Common 
			Market and Food Security, at the Oman Chamber of Commerce and 
			Industry. “The Sultanate is a leader and a pioneering country in 
			meeting the requirements of 10 paths of the Gulf common market, an 
			indication of the good implementation of decisions pertaining to GCC 
			citizenship,” said HE Attiyah. He added that food security will be 
			an important issue at the forthcoming GCC summit to be held in 
			Muscat in December, 2008.<br>
			<br>
			Referring to the food security seminar held in Riyadh in November 
			2008 H E Attiyah said it contributed to formulating a joint policy 
			on food security. The recommendations of Riyadh and Muscat seminars 
			will be presented to the Muscat Summit, he added. The 
			recommendations focused on a few main themes – local production of 
			foodstuff, GCC food imports and foreign investments. The primary aim 
			of these initiatives is to formulate a contingency plan to face any 
			lack of food supplies in GCC countries. He also talked about the 
			progress made by the GCC common market. HE Attiyah noted that the 
			announcement of the Gulf common market has come as an additional 
			incentive for the GCC governments and citizens to focus on major 
			issues. “There is a need to eliminate any constraints that may have 
			limited the member states’ ability to benefit from the previous 
			resolutions. It is necessary to remind citizens and officials of the 
			rights and obligations secured by the Gulf common market,” he added.</font></p>

			<b>Majeed Al Asfoor’s election as the Chairman of the Oman Tennis 
			Association is a befitting tribute to his talent and association 
			with the game</b><br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="newsm12.jpg" width="180" height="214" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Majeed Al Asfoor, executive manager, marketing, public relations and 
			information, Oman Arab Bank has been elected as the chairman of the 
			Oman Tennis Association (OTA). Al Asfoor takes charge for a 
			four-year term till 2012. He was chosen amongst the top ranking 
			Omani tennis players since 1974 until his retirement from the 
			national team. He won the first official tournament organised in 
			1986 by the OTA. In 1977 he became the Omani player to take part in 
			the First International Tennis Tournament organised in the Sultanate 
			of Oman at Gulf Hotel (Crowne Plaza), along with a number of world 
			ranking players. He won the third prize at the Gulf Tennis 
			Tournament in 1979 in Bahrain.<br>
			<br>
			In his speech on the occasion Al Asfoor expressed his thanks and 
			appreciation to the heads and representatives of the clubs for 
			electing the new board and the ministry of sports affairs for 
			supervising the conduct of the elections. Says Al Asfoor, “We will 
			continue the efforts of our predecessors and promise to work towards 
			the development of tennis in the Sultanate.” Al Asfoor was one of 
			the founder members of the OTA in 1986. He worked in all the 
			committees of the association at different intervals and was its 
			Vice president before he resigned in 1996.<br>
			<br>
			Al Asfoor represented the OTA at the International Tennis Federation 
			(ITF), the Asian Association, the Arabian Association and the 
			Organising Committee for Tennis at the GCC for 10 years, from 1986 
			to 1996. He has also worked as the general secretary, Organisation 
			Committee for Tennis, in the GCC. Al Afsoor’s election is surely a 
			homecoming of sorts for the tennis veteran. </font></p>

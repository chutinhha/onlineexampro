                        There are 
                        several Omani products which can compete well in the 
                        international market and OCIPED works hand in hand with 
                        the local businessmen to tap new export markets,

                        Al Mar’a (Regional edition), the sister publication of 
                        Oman Economic Review, touched the lives of children and 
                        women beyond Muscat in a very special way. The Al Mar’a 
                        team visited schools in the interiors and distributed 
                        specially designed certificates on the occassion of 
                        Mother’s Day to children — who in turn would present the 
                        same to their respective mothers to display their love 
                        and gratitude. Needless to say, it got an enthusiastic 
                        response from children and their mothers too! </font></p>

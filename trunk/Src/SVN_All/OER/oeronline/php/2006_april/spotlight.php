            air conditioning and refrigeration sector is cashing in on the 
            ongoing construction boom. Multinational giants in association with 
            their local dealers are competing with each other to get a better 
            slice of the market. <br>

            focusing on energy efficiency, low noise levels and foolproof air 
            purifying system. Research and development centers of these 
            companies are constantly trying to improve compressor designs to 
            make them faster, quieter, more reliable and energy efficient. <br>
            <br>
            As far as the size of the local market is concerned, as many as 
            145,000 air conditioners were sold in the Sultanate in 2004. 
            Although the domestic market is dominated by Japanese and Korean 
            brands, Saudi-based firms are also trying to make their presence 
            felt in Oman. Industry sources said they expect a better demand for 
            AC’s even as the country is getting into the main summer season. <br>

            Window vs Split AC’s</b><br>
            But customers are becoming more selective and there has been a clear 
            shift in consumer preference. People are switching over from windows 
            to split air conditioners as they started realizing the advantages 
            of such units. On the one hand, the difference in prices between 
            these two types is increasingly narrowing down, while on the other, 
            split AC’s consume less power than window AC’s. Although villa and 
            flat owners who buy air-conditioners for their own use prefer split 
            AC’s, those who rent out their apartments still go for window units.

            Competitive Gameplan</b><br>
            Major players like LG, Panasonic, Daikin, Sanyo, Videocon, York, 
            Hitachi, Best and Admiral have all introduced state-of-the-art 
            features in their new models. Oman Gulf Enterprises (OGE) of OTE 
            Group, the exclusive distributor of LG air conditioners in Oman, 
            provides an effective after sales service through its well-trained 
            personnel, fully equipped service infrastructure and a mobile 
            service van with a 24-hour access facility and a toll free number. 
            OGE has the advantage of support/partnership of over 60 dealers in 
            the Sultanate, with a presence in almost every town. The company has 
            in excess of 12 service franchisees covering a total of 24 towns 
            across Oman. Like other leading players, LG is experiencing an 
            upsurge in sales of air-conditioners and refrigerators. <br>
            <br>
            LG Electronics is the world’s leading air conditioner supplier for 
            the fifth consecutive year and sold more than 10 million units in 
            2004, securing 20 per cent market share globally. Leading Japanese 
            market research consultancy Fuji-Keizai estimates that the Korean 
            giant made one out of every five AC’s sold around the world. 
            Similarly, regional sales of LG air conditioners soared 26.9 per 
            cent in 2004 to account for $349 million in turnover. The company 
            retained its top position in more than 40 countries across the 
            world, which include Oman, Saudi Arabia, the US and Korea. <br>
            <br>
            LG Electronics recently introduced its multi-power system (MPS) air 
            conditioning system in the Middle East. MPS is LG’s proprietary 
            technology that combines multiple compressors in a single air 
            conditioning system to reduce air conditioning energy consumption by 
            a maximum of 70 per cent, compared to conventional air conditioners 
            with a single compressor.<br>
            <br>
            LG Artcool air conditioners allow the customers to adapt the look of 
            air conditioner to suit their individual taste. Available in a 
            variety of colour finishes, this design won the 2002 International 
            Forum Design Award. Another feature is its unique neo-plasma air 
            purifying system equipped with 12 bio–enzyme filters, which enhances 
            its sterilization power. The system can eliminate fine dust and 
            moulds, ordinary odours, and cigar smoke more powerfully. It can 
            also destroy bacteria cell walls and completely kill them proving 
            its string sterilization abilities. Goldfin anti–corrosion is 
            available as standard on all window and wall split units from LG, 
            which ensures that the condenser fins remain free of corrosion and 
            help to keep the unit performing like new. <br>
            <br>
            Panasonic has also introduced state-of-the-art features in its 
            recent models. An important feature is the Super Alleru Buster - an 
            air purifying system that checks up to 99 per cent of allergents and 
            harmful bacteria from the air. Omasco, which represents Panasonic in 
            the Sultanate, markets and offers after sales service to the 
            company’s entire range of split, window, cassette type, ceiling and 
            ducted type models. <br>
            <br>
            Daikin Industries, which is represented by Muscat Electronics 
            Company (MEC) in Oman, was the first company to produce air 
            conditioners in Japan almost 68 years ago. It is a pioneer in 
            air-conditioning systems with a strong backing of a research and 
            development department. The company is also inventors of various 
            type of air-conditioners, refrigerant gases and compressors. For 
            instance, Daikin has invented the ultimate in air conditioning 
            system - Variable Refrigerant Volume (VRV) Intelligent System. <br>
            <br>
            The new system, which is fully controlled by a foolproof data 
            communication, consists of an outdoor unit connected through a pair 
            of refrigerant piping and a pair of cabling from more than 24 indoor 
            units to a single modular outdoor unit. Each indoor unit asks for 
            the required amount of refrigerant gas to the outdoor unit as per 
            the cooling requirement of the room. It saves power to the extent of 
            35 per cent as compared to the conventional system. <br>
            <br>
            Daikin has a wide range of air-conditioning system, which include 
            splits, multi-splits, ducted splits, cassette units, ceiling 
            suspended units, free standing units, marine AC’s, packed AC’s, 
            chilled water plants and the ultimate VRV system. Daikin is 
            generally considered as a trouble-free air conditioner.<br>
            <br>
            Muscat Electronics Company also represents Supra and Chigo brand of 
            air conditioners in Oman. Supra is made in the Middle-East and is 
            designed for harsh and rugged condition of Gulf.<br>
            <br>
            Genetco represents several multinational brands such as York, Sanyo, 
            Videocon, Best and Admiral in the Sultanate. The company introduced 
            new models of York air-conditioner with several added features. The 
            advantages of the York Mastercold split AC include energy 
            efficiency, low noise level and it releases a clean and healthy air. 
            The condenser unit of the AC is quoted with anti-corrosion quoting 
            and therefore the life of the AC is much better. <br>
            <br>
            Genetco has one of the largest dealership and service centers in the 
            country. The agency, which has 7 showrooms in different parts of the 
            country, has franchise arrangements for servicing their products.<br>

            Environment-friendly</b><br>
            Producers of air conditioners are spending millions of dollars to 
            develop a wide range of innovative refrigeration concepts that are 
            less harmful to the environment than conventional technologies. 
            Research is being conducted on to develop alternative refrigerants 
            that do not harm the ozone layer or cause global warming. For 
            instance, researchers are looking at the possibility of using carbon 
            dioxide as a refrigerant.<br>
            <br>
            Carbon dioxide was the refrigerant of choice during the early 20th 
            century but was later replaced with man-made chemicals. Now carbon 
            dioxide may be on the verge of a comeback, thanks to technological 
            advances that include the manufacture of extremely thin aluminum 
            tubing called ‘microchannels.’ Although carbon dioxide is a 
            global-warming gas, conventional refrigerants, called 
            hydrofluorocarbons, cause much more global warming than the same 
            quantity of carbon dioxide.<br>
            <br>
            The tiny quantities of carbon dioxide that would be released from 
            air conditioners would be insignificant compared to the huge amounts 
            produced from burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation.<br>
            <br>
            Carbon dioxide is promising for systems that must be small and 
            lightweight, such as automotive or portable air conditioners. 
            Various factors, including the high operating pressure required for 
            carbon dioxide systems, enable the refrigerant to flow through 
            small-diameter tubing, which allows engineers to design more compact 
            air conditioners. <br>
            <br>
            During the 1930s, carbon dioxide was replaced by synthetic 
            chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants, known as CFCs, which worked well in 
            low-pressure systems. But scientists later discovered that those 
            refrigerants were damaging the earth’s stratospheric ozone layer, 
            which filters dangerous ultraviolet radiation. CFCs have since been 
            replaced by hydrofluorocarbons, which are not hazardous to the ozone 
            layer but still cause global warming.<br>

            company once again occupies the Global No. 1 position in terms of 
            market share, topping 10 million unit sales. LG has occupied top 
            spot in air conditioner manufacturing for the sixth consecutive year 
            since 2000 with average annual growth of 20% during the same period.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yong Jin Khang, head of air conditioning overseas marketing, LG 
            Electronics Digital Appliance Company said: “The highest market 
            share re-affirms the outstanding quality of our products and 
            in-depth perspective on consumer trends. LG has focused on premium 
            air conditioner products since 2004 and plans to further strengthen 
            its state-of-the-art ARTCOOL air conditioners in future.” <br>
            <br>
            According to Japan-based Fuji Economy Research Institute, Kezai, LG 
            sold approximately 10,500,000 air-conditioner units, occupying 
            largest market share in the approximately 60,420,000 unit-sized 
            industry. LG also widened the sales gap by over 3 million units with 
            its next contender. LG dramatically increased sales volume of its 
            residential air conditioners starting from 4.1 million in 2001.<br>
            <br>
            Consumers value LG for understanding their needs and providing 
            lifestyle-enhancing values. Khang explained: “The important consumer 
            trends of air conditioning industry 2005 are eco-friendly features, 
            localized product, and colourful design, all in which LG excels.” LG 
            introduced an “Eco Design” tool in its air conditioner, banning use 
            of environmentally destructive heavy metals such as lead and 
            cadmium. Its Multi Power System, combining multiple compressors in a 
            single air conditioning system, reduces the system’s energy 
            consumption by a maximum of 70 percent, compared to conventional 
            one-compressor air conditioners. <br>
            <br>
            LG pursued country-and-culture specific product development to 
            become the world leader in air conditioner market. For the Middle 
            East, LG introduced “Tropical” air conditioners, withstanding the 
            region’s hot and humid climate. In Europe, LG established number of 
            ‘Art Clima’ upscale shops exclusively for its high-end Art Cool air 
            conditioners, catering to style-seeking consumers.<br>
            <br>
            Responding to the growing demand for household appliances to blend 
            with home interior decoration, LG added renditions of world famous 
            pieces by Van Gogh and Sisley among others, on the front panel of 
            its “ARTCOOL” air conditioners. LG’s trend-setting design innovation 
            will continue to lead the market in 2006, with the incorporation of 
            a world-first feature - the replaceable front panel. Consumers can 
            now freely change the design of the front panel of their air 
            conditioners by simply inserting any painting, printed design or 
            even a family picture inside the panel. <br>

            globetrotters, unveiling of new projects — it’s a wide spectrum of 
            sunny indicators for the hospitality industry in the Sultanate right 
            now, and Muscat in particular. No wonder, hotels are bursting at the 
            seams when it comes to occupancy. An increasing interest in the 
            Sultanate as a leisure destination has changed the dynamics of what 
            was once perceived as a static, oversupplied market.<br>
            <br>
            2005 saw Oman making its mark as a top brand tourist destination 
            with European leisure guests, GCC business travellers, MICE 
            (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) business guests. 
            All of these are swelling in numbers as the months pass by.<br>
            <br>
            “Oman is a hot destination right now,” says A. Antonio Zamora, 
            Director of Operations, Al Bustan Palace, the government-run hotel 
            located 8 km from the downtown business district in Muscat, and 
            surrounded by a dramatic mountain backdrop, of sea and beach. “It 
            (Oman) has become the destination of choice for the whole of 
            Europe,” Zamora exclaims and adds: “Efforts are being made now to 
            attract tourists from countries like the United States.” <br>
            <br>
            According to the HotelBenchmark Survey by Deloitte, the Middle East 
            region, with an impressive 21 per cent growth in revenue per 
            available room (revPAR), was for the second year in a row, the best 
            performing region in the world during 2005 (See Box: Middle East 
            Shining). As per the survey, hotels in Oman took the third prize – a 
            no mean achievement - with revPAR growth of 54 per cent. The 
            HotelBenchmark Survey contains the largest independent source of 
            hotel performance data outside of North America and tracks the 
            performance of over 6,500 hotels and 1.2 million rooms every month.<br>

            <img border="0" src="cover03.jpg" width="250" height="249" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2"></a></b>As 
            for the boom in Oman, one just needs to have a look at some of the 
            figures achieved by the major hotels. Grand Hyatt, Muscat had 
            averaged 75 per cent occupancy in 2004. But it (occupancy) jumped to 
            85 per cent in 2005. And to add to it, the first two months of 2006 
            have been excellent. The growth witnessed in 2004 and 2005 continues 
            this year as well.<br>
            <br>
            Radisson SAS Hotel, Muscat finished with an occupancy rate of around 
            95 per cent in 2005. In the preceding year, it had registered a mere 
            78 per cent occupancy. As for 2006, says Christopher Pike, General 
            Manager: “It continues to be very strong. And the rates are 
            continuing to grow.”<br>
            <br>
            For The Chedi, Muscat, there was a big leap in occupancy in 2005, 
            compared to 2004, says York Brandes, the premier hotel’s General 
            Manager. “The jump was approximately to the tune of 25-30 per cent. 
            We had a slow beginning in 2004 and a very strong winter season. 
            Occupancy remained high even in Ramadan period (when it usually 
            takes a beating). We had a very good start in 2005, which continues 
            till date,” Brandes claims.<br>
            <br>
            Zamora, the GM of Al Bustan Palace (part of InterContinental Hotels 
            Group), considers 2005 a “spectacular year” for the Omani 
            hospitality industry. “We did very well despite the fact that we do 
            not have commercial travellers here at Al Bustan. What we need in 
            Muscat right now is more hotel rooms.”<br>
            <br>
            Golden Tulip Seeb was reported to have registered 76 per cent 
            occupancy in 2005 compared to 67 per cent in 2004. Holiday Inn 
            Muscat reportedly saw its occupancy in 2005 shooting up to 74.32 per 
            cent from 67.28 per cent in the preceding year. <br>
            <br>
            <a href="JavaScript:NewWindow('new2.htm')">
            <img border="0" src="cover04.jpg" width="200" height="134" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2"></a>Intercontinental, 
            Muscat was no different. Says Renzo M. Cavagliotti, the 
            government-run hotel’s General Manager: “2005 was actually a very 
            good year for us. The occupancy went up to around 72.3 per cent in 
            2005, compared to 69.8 per cent in 2004. And the best part was, more 
            than the occupancy, the room rates registered a 35 per cent 
            increase, which is quite extraordinary for any country.” And 
            Cavagliotti is further buoyed by the fact that the rate has 
            registered another 15 per cent hike in January and February this 
            year.<br>
            <br>
            Room Rates: Towards the Roof Cavagliotti is not the only one 
            surprised by the surge in room rates. If one considers that it was 
            not in the too distant past when rate cuts were often employed by 
            the hotel industry, in general, to attract traffic, it is truly 
            astonishing. <br>
            <br>
            Pike of Radisson SAS says: “In the last one and a half years, the 
            average room rates have inched towards a more realistic level. In 
            the past, the demand was obviously not as strong as it is now. The 
            demand is shooting up and so the opportunities are there to push the 
            room rates up to a level where it reflects the true value of the 
            hotels, the products, and the services offered by us.” <br>
            <br>
            Brandes, Chedi’s GM, is more categorical as he declares: “I can 
            guarantee that all of us will increase the room rates.” His hotel 
            has seen the rates grow approximately between 8 and 10 per cent 
            between 2004 and 2005. “ When we first pushed the rate up, people 
            were saying we wouldn’t be able to manage it. Now, look at the 
            figures of the last two years! We have been the driving force behind 
            driving up the room rates of the hotel industry here. Our hotel 
            keeps full even at the much higher rate,” he declares. <br>
            <br>
            Al Bustan’s Zamora puts the expectations into figures: “We are again 
            looking at a double-digit hike in rates this year.” The hotel had 
            already registered double-digit hikes in both 2004 and 2005.<br>
            <br>
            Munir Ahmed, General Manager of Grand Hyatt Muscat, a private-run 
            premier hotel, feels the move to hike rates had also to do with the 
            Dubai example. “People saw what had happened in Dubai. The rates had 
            gone very high. Oman, to an extent, only followed suit and rates 
            went up by 30-45 per cent. Earlier, the rates were very low in Oman. 
            In fact, the 22 Arab countries had one of the lowest rates. Oman is 
            now is in the big league but is still very good value for money. The 
            rates here are still far below compared to some of the neighbouring 
            countries.”</font></p>

            Who is coming: A profile</b><br>
            When it comes to the profile of the tourists flocking to Oman, it is 
            probably the Europeans, whose number is the highest, especially 
            those coming from the UK and Germany.<br>
            <br>
            However, Pike of Radisson SAS is convinced that the profile of 
            visitors is across the board. He says it is a similar nature of 
            guests who have been visiting Oman in the past; only their numbers 
            have swelled now.<br>
            <br>
            Brandes of The Chedi confirms that most of the tourists coming to 
            Oman are from Europe. “We also have visitors from Asia but there are 
            hardly any Americans. The trend will stay like this.”<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The Boom Factors: Why Now?</b><br>
            Why did the boom happen now? After all, what suddenly changed in a 
            couple of years? The top executives of Oman’s hotels say that the 
            Omani government’s increasingly effective marketing and promotion 
            strategies abroad, coupled with the demand pressures in Dubai, are 
            really working wonders. <br>
            <br>
            The hospitality industry in the Middle East (ME) was down in the 
            dumps following 9/11. Tourism in ME felt the direct impact of the 
            World Trade Centre crash. Therefore, few could have visualised this 
            boom coming within a few years later. Robert Maclean, Principal of National 
            Hospitality Institute (NHI), feels terrorism does not have that big 
            an impact on tourism as a large part of the globe is affected by it 
            and people would ultimately like to go where they want. “I think the 
            publicity and the perception of Dubai has created a better 
            environment in this region than it would have had done normally.”
            <br>
            <br>
            In fact, the Ministry of Tourism has been burning the proverbial 
            midnight oil to attract tourists for a long time now. Says Zamora of 
            Al Bustan: “The efforts of the Ministry of Tourism over the last 
            10-15 years are beginning to pay off now.”<br>
            <br>
            The Omani Government, in 2005, created Ministry of Tourism as an 
            independent ministry, a step highly valuable for the tourism sector 
            in the Sultanate.<br>
            <br>
            Tourism, says Hyatt’s Ahmed, depends on ease of travel, connections 
            and arrival. “Oman government’s lifting of the visa restrictions and 
            making it easier for people to get visas on arrival, was the 
            starting point for Muscat taking off as a major tourist 
            destination.” <br>
            <br>
            According to Pike of Radisson SAS, the setting up of the Ministry of 
            Tourism has been a very positive move in the promotion of Oman 
            tourism. One of the key steps that the ministry took was to employ 
            market-based representatives in the key feeder markets in Europe, 
            Asia etc. These market-based representatives are filling the need, 
            which was perhaps missing in the past. Awareness of the consumer is 
            the key in feeder markets. <br>
            <br>
            Pike of Radisson says: “Tour operators are now coming to the 
            hoteliers of Oman asking for rooms, rather than us chasing them. The 
            interest from international tour operators in Oman is certainly 
            increasing. They see it as a destination for the future. I certainly 
            see Oman as the destination of the future.” <br>
            <br>
            NHI’s Maclean agrees that Oman is now being better marketed, 
            particularly in the UK where it’s very much being seen as the 
            slightly mystical and magical. “I think that is an attraction. 
            People are getting a bit fed up of some of the traditional 
            Mediterranean locations. Oman is in the niche category. A large 
            number of people are coming in from Europe, and at quite expensive 
            rates too.”<br>
            <br>
            It is no small coincidence that this boom in tourism traffic comes 
            at a time when the Sultanate’s economy is booming and the upcoming 
            industrial projects in Sohar are all set to catapult the Sultanate 
            to a new pedestal in the GCC and global fraternity. <br>
            <br>
            Zamora of Al Bustan Palace feels the Tsunami had shut a substantial 
            number of tourist destinations in the Far East. “That traffic had to 
            go somewhere. Some went to the Bahamas and the Caribbean, but some 
            came here (to Oman),” he says. <br>
            <b><br>
            Boom: How Real? </b><br>
            It would be prudent, however, to gauge how real this hospitality 
            industry boom is. After all, the surge in room rates may not 
            continue for that long, and may plateau out, sooner than expected. 
            Says Brandes of Chedi: “There is still a little bit space for 
            further increase in room rates but we have to be careful that we do 
            not shoot ourselves off the mark. As long as you are reasonable, you 
            can deliver.”<br>
            And, what happens when the mega tourism and residential development 
            projects like The Wave (expected to be completed by the end of 
            2007), Blue City, and at least seven other projects - in various 
            stages of discussion/finalisation – get ready? “Five years from now, 
            there will be a lot of availability but the demand may not be as 
            much,” agrees Brandes. “So we have to be more careful from both the 
            sides,” he adds.<br>
            <br>
            Pike of Radisson SAS echoes similar sentiment: “Hotels are all 
            enjoying high occupancies now and the rates are continuing to grow. 
            But for how long they will continue to grow is something I cannot 
            say at the moment. I think the rates will plateau out a little bit. 
            They have already started to. ”</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The Challenges</b><br>
            What about the challenges facing the hotel industry? Are they being 
            brushed aside in the din of soaring occupancy and room rates? Pike 
            of Radisson SAS is quite clear about the challenges when he says: 
            “There is room for little more growth in the occupancies. There is 
            still the scope to work out something for the summer time. Leisure 
            tourism is one area we need to focus on in the future. We can 
            certainly drive more business in the low season (summer time).” 
            According to Brandes, everybody is concentrating on only the beach 
            resorts in Oman at the moment. “What’s missing here is stunning 
            desert resort, or something stunning in the mountains.”<br>
            <br>
            The other challenge, says Brandes, is the drop in occupancies in the 
            summer months. “Last June, we had 42 per cent occupancy, in July 30 
            per cent, and in August 45 per cent. But one cannot drop the rate 
            dramatically. I think it is just too important to cover your cost.”<br>
            <br>
            Cavagliotti says that the InterContinental is going to launch 
            several different packages for the lean months. But he agrees it 
            will probably take some time to change the perception. “People are 
            under the impression that there is no way that they can come to Oman 
            in summers. This shouldn’t be the case as Dubai has managed quite 
            well to reverse the trend. With time, I believe we can achieve this 
            in Oman also. But then, it is not something that can be done 
            overnight.” <br>
            <br>
            Maclean puts the challenges in a wider perspective. “With 
            occupancies going up, the pressure on operations has increased too. 
            Room rates have trebled from what they were two years ago. So, a 
            customer is now paying three times the rate. As a corollary to it, 
            he now nurtures three times the expectations in terms of service and 
            facilities. But the young person, who is delivering it, has not been 
            trained for three times the duration. And he is not being paid three 
            times the salary. So, there is a bit of a gap in expectation. And, 
            we’ve got less time to produce a higher level of skill sets. This, 
            really, is a challenge.”<br>
            <br>
            The challenge for a training institute like NHI is that it is now 
            dealing with some very high-standard hotels that are charging their 
            clients a lot of money. “Therefore, they expect the skills of our 
            people to be at a much higher level than earlier. But we get only a 
            fixed period of time to train them. And we do as much as possible 
            within that time,” adds Maclean.<br>
            <br>
            How ready is the trainee for the market? According to Maclean, they 
            (trainees) are 70 per cent ready. They have got over another 
            three-four months to become 100 per cent ready, which is supposed to 
            happen at their workplace.<br>
            <br>
            Are there any challenges on the demand-supply front? On the supply 
            side, Maclean does not see a challenge. “We have managed to satisfy 
            the needs of most of the hotels for the last couple of years. Even 
            as we had Shangri-La coming in, we were still able to provide 
            trainees to most of the other hotels.”<br>
            <br>
            Maclean, however, sees some challenges on another front. He feels 
            that with this new move on expatriates not requiring No Objection 
            Certificates to move around, there are bound to be some challenges 
            there. <br>
            <br>
            He guesses that the hospitality industry is now going to see some 
            more normal working environment (read hours). “We all accept that 
            the hospitality industry is horrific when it comes to working hours 
            but things are changing for the better. And this will make it an 
            industry of choice for workers.” <br>
            <br>
            Maclean, however, feels one of the major benefits of the boom in the 
            hospitality industry that it will pave the way for greater 
            Omanization. “I think any employer will say the same.” Some of the 
            major hospitality entities see construction work next to the hotel 
            as a major challenge and concern for the year 2006. Some of them 
            have had to cancel room nights, reflecting, thereby, a significant 
            loss. The increase in the small hotels and apartments, which sell 
            the rooms and other services at very low rates are major concerns to 
            some of the major hotels. <br>
            <b><br>
            The Great Debate: Private versus Public</b><br>
            According to a dominant view, one of the major challenges facing the 
            hospitality industry in Oman rests in the “private-versus-public” 
            domain. Two of the major hotels in the city of Muscat — 
            InterContinental and Al Bustan Palace — are government-owned. Then, 
            some of the other big ones — like The Chedi and Barr Al Jissah — 
            also have significant stake of the government. While Barr Al Jissah 
            has reportedly 40 per cent government stake, The Chedi is mainly 
            owned by the Government Pension Funds. Grand Hyatt is probably the 
            only big player in Muscat that is fully owned by the private hand.
            <br>
            <br>
            Grand Hyatt is doing exceedingly well. Says Ahmed, the hotels’ GM: 
            “By and large, it’s paramount that the government plays a regulatory 
            role in it (hospitality industry) rather than having a deep 
            involvement. When you are a private enterprise employee, you’ll make 
            a much bigger effort to get the business in, and to look after it. I 
            think that in the service industry, although it’s very desirable for 
            the government to get involved in the initial stages, as we move 
            forward, private enterprise ought to be left to thrive and survive 
            on its own and make its own mark.”<br>
            <br>
            Brandes of The Chedi echoes a similar view. “I agree that they (the 
            hotels) should all be private.”<br>
            <br>
            Says Maclean: “It’s interesting to see that one of the most 
            successful hotels at the moment is the Grand Hyatt. It’s private. 
            Crowne Plaza is doing extremely well and it’s private. And the 
            government is actually selling the Golden Tulip Seeb (located near 
            the Seeb Airport). I think it is a good move. I think the government 
            has realised that it should not really be in the hotel business. 
            Yes, there is a responsibility to get things going but it should 
            withdraw.” <br>
            Of Shangri-La, Maclean says it would be interesting to see whether 
            the government retains its share or not. “I have always said that 
            Shangri-La is like a watershed. It is like unlocking the dam.”<br>
            <br>
            Maclean adds: “Okay, there are some exceptions. There is Al Bustan. 
            There is Intercontinental. Bustan has always been an icon for the 
            government. But there is talk of the Intercontinental going 
            private.” <br>
            <br>
            However, Zamora of Al Bustan does not think that ownership has 
            anything to do with operating a resort or hotel. “This hotel (Al 
            Bustan) does the business it does because it is the kind of hotel it 
            is. A tourist never says he wants to go to Al Bustan because it is 
            owned by the government. There may be some business coming to the 
            hotel because it is owned by the government but it is not the reason 
            for its success now. The other hotels that are not governed by the 
            government are performing equally well.”<br>
            <br>
            However, even Zamora is not sure if it is in a government’s interest 
            to be long-term shareholder in any industry. “I guess in the long 
            term the government will sell its equity in the hospitality industry 
            and allow the market to be totally in the hands of the private 
            sector.” <br>
            It cost around half a billion dollar in 1985 to build the Al Bustan 
            Palace. A private company — probably — wouldn’t have spent this kind 
            of money to set up a hotel. But while it is all right for a 
            government-backed hotel to have consistently high occupancy, when 
            there are such high investments, the break-even period is quite 
            long. So, until the break-even point is achieved, even higher 
            occupancy fails to cut losses. And it is here that the logic of 
            private ownership for the hospitality industry makes more sense. 
            For, a private enterprise is – usually – more cost-conscious, and 
            works to achieve the break-even with greater passion. </font></p>

            Oman is, arguably, the most interesting hotel market to watch out 
            for in 2006. The arrival numbers are swelling, and there are all 
            indications that it is growing at a rate where it is bound to carve 
            out a niche for itself.<br>
            <br>
            What’ more, the potential future developments – most of them are 
            destination-focused resorts - here are spread across right across 
            the length and breadth of the country, rather than centred around 
            Muscat. The strong development regions are Sohar, Ras Al Hadd, 
            Musandam, and, of course, Muscat.<br>
            <br>
            A peep into the performance of the hospitality industry in the first 
            two months of 2006 clearly tells the tale. The Chedi has registered 
            occupancy of 95 per cent in this period.<br>
            <br>
            Al Bustan’s Zamora says judging 2006 by its first quarter, it’s 
            going to be an excellent year. “We are ahead of last year in budget 
            and average rate. I look at 2006 and 2007 as offering excellent 
            prospects for the tourism industry.” 2005, he says, was better than 
            2004 and 2006 will be better than 2005. “However, you must be 
            practical and realistic. Dubai is doing very well. Dubai occupancies 
            are higher than ours in the summer months. I think our government is 
            taking the steps so that we have greater occupancies in the leaner 
            months. But the industry as a whole in the ME is booming. We are 
            emerging as an equal player with the best.” <br>
            <br>
            Brandes guesses the industry is going to continue like it did last 
            year. He even hints at the problem of plenty, saying his hotel is 
            already, almost always full. “We actually cannot have more 
            occupancy,” he points out.<br>
            <br>
            Oman boasts of some of the most majestic hotels in the region. Now, 
            with Shangri-La opening, the marketing reach is getting stronger. 
            There are more operators in the market. And the more the operators 
            in the market, the wider the reach of the marketing! <br>

                <font face="Verdana" size="1">With over 60 per cent of markets 
                in the Middle East reporting double-digit revPAR increases, it 
                is hardly surprising that the region took the gold medal for 
                hotel performance growth, says the Deloitte survey report. Of 
                all the 165 markets tracked by the HotelBenchmark™ Global 
                Ranking Index, the Middle East secured six of the top ten spots 
                in terms of revPAR growth in 2005. <br>
                <br>
                Hotels in Qatar, as per the report, won the coveted first prize 
                as revPAR stormed ahead 62 per cent. With an impressive 21% 
                growth in revenue per available room (revPAR), the Middle East 
                region was, for the second year in a row, the best performing 
                region in the world during 2005, according to the HotelBenchmark 
                Survey by Deloitte.<br>
                <br>
                According to the report, this growth was fuelled by an 
                incredible 23 per cent increase in average room rates, which 
                soared to US$117 compared to US$95 in 2004. Despite falling back 
                slightly occupancy continues to be at an all time high at nearly 
                70 per cent. This contrasts starkly with the 60 per cent 
                occupancy levels reported in wake of the 9/11 attacks and 
                subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br>
                <br>
                Occupancy levels across the UAE continue to exceed the 80 per 
                cent barrier with hotels in Dubai reporting annualised occupancy 
                levels of 85 per cent. Across the Emirate, says the Deloitte 
                report, there is strong all year demand with many months 
                reporting demand in excess of 90 per cent. This contrasts with 
                hotels in Saudi Arabia, which have the most volatile demand 
                patterns. Makkah and Medina in particular are hajj (pilgrimage) 
                destinations and therefore have a very seasonal performance. At 
                the height of the pilgrim season, occupancy can reach 90 per 
                cent but during the off-season demand falls away resulting in 
                occupancy levels below 20 per cent, says the report.<br>
                <br>
                In terms of average room rate, Kuwait remains the most expensive 
                country with average room rates currently trading at US$196. 
                Commenting on the results, Julia Felton, Executive Director of 
                the HotelBenchmark™ at Deloitte said: “The Middle East has 
                undergone a metamorphosis during the last decade, so naturally 
                hotel performance has benefited. International visitor arrivals 
                to the Middle East have nearly tripled from 13.5m in 1995 to 
                38.4m in 2005, representing a compound annual growth rate of 
                12.3 per cent.”<br>
                <br>
                “Increased demand has been supported by the transformation of 
                both the airline and hotel industry across the region. Passenger 
                traffic through the Gulf is the now fastest growing in the 
                world, rising by 10 per cent per annum and there has been a 
                rapid expansion of regionally-based international carriers such 
                as Emirates Airlines, Eithad Airways, Qatar Airways and Gulf 
                Air. Hotel development continues unabated across the regions 
                with all the global hotel brands either having established or 
                have advanced plans to expand their significant presence in the 
                region. It is estimated that 80 new hotels will open on the 
                Arabian Peninsula by 2008. Dubai leads the field and remains the 
                major focus of development with an estimated 12,500 rooms being 
                added to supply over the next four years. Qatar and Kuwait are 
                also projected to see increases in rooms’ supply of 145 per cent 
                and 75 per cent respectively.”</font></td>

                <p align="justify" style="margin: 10px">
                <font face="Verdana" size="1">Barr Al Jissah Resort opened with 
                much fanfare early this year. The OR 70million resort, jointly 
                promoted by the Zubair Corporation and the Omani Government, is 
                spread across an area of 450,000 sq metres of breathtaking 
                beachfront. “We look at projects like this in a very positive 
                light,” says Ahmed, Grand Hyatt’s GM. “In the last two years, 
                thanks to the growth of tourism in Oman, it was getting 
                difficulttofindrooms.A destinationbeginslosingitsimpactif more 
                and more people can’t come in.” As for the competition,he says: 
                “Barr Al Jissa is, by and large, a tourist location. We are more 
                in the city. We are more towards the corporate side. It will not 
                impact us. It will only add to the name and lure of the 
                destination.”However, Al Bustan is located in the vicinity. So, 
                the wheel of competition automatically turns towards its 
                scenicgrandeur. Says its Director of Operations: “It has not 
                affected us.” However, Zamora admits: “When Shangri-La opened, 
                even I thought it would have an impact on us, or that we’ll at 
                least suffer a few points of percentage in occupancy.<br>
                <br>
                I was concerned.” And so was the GM of Chedi. “I am sure there 
                were some concerns.” But he goes on to add: “You can see from 
                the figuresatthemoment.Noneofus have been affected by 
                Shangri-La,” says Brandes.</font></td>

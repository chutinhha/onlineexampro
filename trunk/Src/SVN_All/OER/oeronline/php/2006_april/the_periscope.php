political firestorm over DP World’s acquisition of a British maritime services 
firm with US port management contracts and the increasing allocation of GCC 
Central Bank reserves to Euros and gold suggest that Arab petrodollars have once 
again become a seismic force in the global financial markets for the first time 
since the OPEC shocks of the 1970’s. <br>
<br>
The IMF estimates that the GCC will generate $300 billion in current account 
surpluses, making the Gulf as significant a supplier of credit to the Euro 
markets as the exporter tiger companies of the Pacific Rim. In essence, GCC 
petrodollars are as mission critical to the financing of the American deficit as 
the central banks of China and Japan, Uncle Sam’s two Asian mega-creditors.<br>
<br>
Without Kuwait’s KIO, Abu Dhabi’s ADIA, and Saudi Arabia’s SAMA, there is no way 
the US Treasury bond auctions could offer its paper IOUs without a quantum 
increase in interest rates. These low T-bond interest rates, in turn, 
jump-started the US and global economies after the trauma of 9/11 and the 
collapse of the Silicon Valley tech bubble. Without petrodollars reserves, the 
zero savings economy of the US would have been mired in recession after 2001 and 
vulnerable to a worldwide run on the dollar, as happened in the twilight of 
Bretton Woods in the early 1970’s, or after the Plaza Accords in 1985.<br>
<b><br>
No Wholesale Abandonment</b><br>
Contrary to media hype, there has been no wholesale abandonment of the American&nbsp; 
financial markets by the GCC sovereign, bank and private investors. GCC currency 
regimes are all pegged to the Dollar; GCC central bank and sovereign investment 
agencies are overwhelmingly invested in dollar bank deposits and bonds; crude 
oil and natural gas are invoiced and settled in dollars; the&nbsp; bulk of the 
Gulf’s private wealth invested offshore, estimated by the IMF as $1.5 trillion, 
is denominated in Dollars. <br>
<br>
Investment logic — not emotions or politics — guides the decision-making process 
in the boardrooms of the Gulf’s smart money gnomes. Sure, perceived, 
expropriation risk and the Patriot Act triggered Saudi private wealth 
withdrawals from US banks and Wall Street but the funds were re-invested in 
Eurodollar and Singapore’s Asia dollar deposits. The petrodollar tsunami from 
the Gulf is a major reason why the US, a nation with a zero savings rate, that 
is now the largest borrower in the history of finance, still commands 
geo-political top banana status just because the Dollar is the world’s 
international reserve currency of the last resort.<br>
<b><br>
Gulf Conservatism</b><br>
Despite the vast infrastructure, property and stock market boom in the GCC, the 
Gulf’s petrodollar bonanza since 2003 is largely invested in Dollars. This is 
because the major oil exporting countries in the GCC have extremely conservative 
oil price projections in their budget process. Hence, 70-80 per cent of their 
petrodollar windfall is invested in global capital markets. Like Norway and 
Singapore, the Gulf has sophisticated investment agencies — ADIA, KIA, Dubai 
Investment Capital — that recycle petrodollars into the world stock, bond and 
property markets. <br>
<br>
In fact, KIO was at one time a major shareholder in British Petroleum, as the 
UAE is in Daimler Chrysler, Ferrari and Doncasters now. Bahraini investment bank 
Investcorp also recycled private Arab petrodollars into the biggest trophy 
leveraged buyout and acquisition deals on Wall Street, including Tiffany’s, 
Gucci and Saks Fifth Avenue. <br>
<br>
Gulf petrodollars also seeded some of the world’s leading money managers and 
commodities funds, including Man’s flagship AHL (the largest “black box” futures 
fund in the world) and the futures legends Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon and 
John Henry, Saudi Prince Waleed bin Talal bailed out Citicorp in 1991 and 
invested in such historic deals as Eurodisney, Canary Wharf Four Seasons, 
Netscape, AOL and Motorola.<br>
<b><br>
Lender of Last Resort</b><br>
The Middle East has been a factor in the foreign exchange market ever since the 
1970s. Kuwait, for instance, helped H. M. Treasury avert Sterling devaluations 
several times by switching from Dollars to Sterling during moments of monetary 
panic in London. <br>
<br>
While oil is priced in Dollars, only two-thirds of Gulf’s offshore reserves are 
invested in the US currency. This means that the Sterling and Euro are 
buttressed by the GCC petrodollar tsunami. <br>
<br>
Moreover, unlike the Asian central banks, Gulf petrodollars are not passive 
actors in the foreign exchange market. Indeed KIO (Kuwait Investment London 
Office) acts sometimes like a profit maximizing global hedge fund, and not like 
passive Asian or European central banks, content to earn money market returns. 
So the greater the scale of petrodollars in the currency bazaars, the greater 
the volatility in the foreign exchange market. It is also no coincidence that 
the great bull markets in gold and silver, traditional Arab hedges against 
inflation and geo-political kismet, came alive just as oil price tripled to $60 
in 2004. The correlation between gold and oil, as in the 1970s, lies in the 
mystique of the Arab petrodollar.<br>
<br>
Gulf central banks cannot respond to asset bubble in the regional share and 
property markets because of their currency pegs. The result? Negative real 
interest rates, rampant stock market speculation, huge inflation and the 
inevitable binge in bank borrowings! The meteoric boom and bust in the GCC 
markets were also a result of a loose monetary policy and overheated economy.
<br>
<br>
The financial markets in the Gulf are still embryonic, so any fall will be 
exaggerated in scale as liquidity disappears when it is needed most. Chaos 
theory is all too relevant in Gulf finance.<br>

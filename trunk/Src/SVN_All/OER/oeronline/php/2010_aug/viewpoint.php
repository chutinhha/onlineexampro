                    </font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
				Since its inception in the 1950s, the technology industry has 
				followed a nimble and adaptive business model due to compressed 
				product lifecycles and a competitive environment<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				The economic crisis hit technology companies with falling demand 
				for both corporate IT and consumer technology products. The 
				industry’s tradition of high speed and agility combined with 
				still-fresh lessons from the dot-com bust is helping its leading 
				companies to execute an extraordinarily rapid, effective 
				response.<br>
				<br>
				While the industry continues to evolve rapidly, the crisis 
				actually accelerated movement toward managed services and 
				adoption of some of the newest business models – particularly 
				the various forms of cloud-computing models because of the 
				pricing advantages they offer. In addition, the increasing 
				pervasiveness of technology in everyday life has helped put a 
				floor under falling demand.<br>
				<br>
				When an industry that normally enjoys growth is hit by 
				double-digit revenue declines, it’s fair to expect a period of 
				adjustment before an effective response is developed and 
				implemented. But leading technology companies could be touted as 
				models for rapid response and excellent execution in the face of 
				the economic crisis. Technology companies are used to being lean 
				and moving fast. And thanks to the severe ups and downs 
				historically experienced in the technology sector, they also 
				know what it’s like to have the bottom drop out. These two 
				factors, when combined, afforded technology the speed to react, 
				and with few exceptions, companies in the sector were able to 
				take decisive action on many fronts simultaneously.<br>
				<br>
				In the current global economic environment, technology companies 
				are primarily focused on two issues:<br>
				<br>
				Building and maintaining a flexible business model<br>
				<br>
				Staying ahead of trends to meet future demand<br>
				<br>
				Due to the industry’s history and dynamics, the typical 
				technology company sees more opportunity ahead and is taking 
				action to position itself to benefit from it.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Technology’s balancing act</b><br>
				<br>
				Technology companies have a higher tolerance – perhaps even an 
				appetite for strategic risk. That appetite is fed not only by 
				low operational gearing but also by low financial gearing (the 
				amount of a company’s debt relative to equity). As such, leading 
				technology companies have a different approach to risk 
				management – an approach that, overall, appears to be working 
				for them. Leading companies also are dealing with global 
				currency fluctuations and considering plans to license yet 
				maintain protection for intellectual property. Balance is the 
				common key issue across all these areas.<br>
				<br>
				Among the leading companies, cost-control efforts have not 
				distracted their focus on generating revenue. A handful of 
				companies even maintained revenue growth through the crisis. In 
				addition, some companies found their own cost-cutting 
				initiatives contributed to their strategies for revenue growth. 
				As they innovated in their own use of technology to cut costs 
				and increase flexibility, they were in position to take those 
				ideas to their customers quickly.<br>
				<br>
				Another common factor among technology companies that have done 
				well through the crisis so far is the rapid deployment of 
				performance improvement programmes to extract additional cash 
				from current assets. Certainly, many technology companies enjoy 
				greater flexibility, or more specifically, lower levels of 
				financial and operational gearing, than other industries. But 
				the point is that they moved quickly to exploit their 
				advantages.<br>
				<br>
				One specific action for asset performance improvement that we’ve 
				seen emerging from the crisis is the rapid adjustment of pricing 
				strategy. A premium approach is viable in good times, but among 
				the most successful technology companies this year are those 
				that aggressively pursued a switch to a value-based pricing 
				strategy. Technology companies, generally, have very 
				well-managed supply chains. During the downturn, however, 
				leading technology companies were increasing their ongoing 
				reassessments of strategic sourcing by identifying the right mix 
				of outsourcing, near-shoring and in-house activities for a full 
				range of core and noncore functions and processes.<br>
				<br>
				<b>IP protection and revenue potential</b><br>
				<br>
				Technology companies fiercely protect their IP in good times and 
				in bad. During the current downturn, however, companies 
				increasingly are considering selling or licensing IP to generate 
				cash flow. If properly managed and protected, the availability 
				of such IP for sale or license has the potential to spur 
				innovation based on or around the technology, even while it 
				generates additional cash for the seller/licensor.<br>
				<br>
				The biggest and toughest IP protection issue for the software 
				sector is piracy. Meanwhile, working with governments around the 
				world to crack down on piracy and vigorously prosecute offenders 
				is beginning to accrue benefits. In August 2009, a Chinese court 
				jailed and fined prominent software pirates in a landmark case, 
				and the UK announced it is considering a plan to join France in 
				cutting off internet access to users who repeatedly download 
				content in violation of copyrights.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tax regulations affecting technology</b><br>
				<br>
				Now, more urgently than ever, technology companies must be 
				prepared to adapt to rapidly changing tax and regulatory rules 
				and the associated risk resulting from these changes. 
				Governments that made big economic stimulus investments to help 
				counteract the downturn, both in spending and tax “holiday” 
				measures, have run up historic deficits. Next, they are likely 
				to accelerate efforts to tighten tax enforcement and compliance 
				and consider revenue-enhancement actions.<br>
				Given the current environment, leading technology companies are 
				becoming more proactive in dealing with tax issues. They are 
				focusing on cash management, looking for incentive programmes 
				that support business goals, actively monitoring tax policy 
				developments and working to improve relationships and 
				communications with tax authorities.<br>
				Most successful companies recognise that proactive tax-cost 
				management can offer significant bottom-line performance 
				improvements, particularly in challenging times. Further, they 
				recognise the importance of understanding the full impact of 
				current tax proposals and the need to get involved in the 
				policy-making process. It’s no surprise that transfer-pricing 
				controversies dominate tax conversations. With global supply 
				chains, products can be sourced and moved around the world with 
				a single mouse click. Cross-border migration of intangibles is 
				commonplace and complex new derivative transactions are being 
				designed to hedge and improve investment returns. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Sustaining the future</b><br>
				<br>
				Hindsight, as the saying goes, is 20/20. So let’s look back, 
				from the vantage point of 2014, to see what lessons from the 
				economic crisis of 2008 to 2009 shaped the technology industry 
				winners and losers over the last five years.<br>
				<br>
				One of the biggest lessons that heralded success in 2009 can be 
				summed up in two words: high performance. Increasing global 
				competition and the rapid pace of technological change set high 
				performance as the minimum cost of market entry. In an era in 
				which market volatility strengthened the axiom that “cash is 
				king,” these companies were able to increase cash reserves, even 
				in the face of direly adverse markets. These are the companies 
				that are well positioned to acquire others. As mentioned 
				previously, they became the “consolidators” of the industry.<br>
				<br>
				Perhaps the most important lesson of 2008 to 2009, however, was 
				a bit more subtle and, therefore, harder to grasp except in 
				hindsight. That lesson’s catchphrase was, “information is 
				power.” As information technology became more deeply embedded in 
				the products and services of other industries, the technology 
				industry began to transform rapidly from a source of innovation 
				to an enabler of innovation in other industries.<br>
				<br>
				The increasing recognition of the ability of sustainability 
				initiatives to increase efficiency and cut costs is worth 
				calling out as a separate lesson. Efficiencies derived from 
				sustainability activities served as a way for technology 
				companies to cut their own costs and raise performance, in the 
				same way that these activities served as a strategic growth 
				opportunity to empower similar results for other industries.<br>
				<br>
				The power of information – properly managed and made widely 
				accessible via different types of communications networks – led 
				to important value creation in those industries. Consequently, 
				technology accelerated innovation in all other industries, 
				helping them grapple with the huge social and economic dynamics 
				of our time.<br>
				<br>
				A big lesson was to tap into social networks in a fearless way 
				to learn what customers really valued and to make technology far 
				more usable to broader populations of users. Winning technology 
				companies learned to leverage the flexibility built into their 
				organisations in order to adapt rapidly to these changes-and to 
				identify the right moments (i.e., when strategic risk was 
				falling) to exploit their low financial and operational gearing 
				and grow market share.<br>
				<b>Adapting and leading change</b><br>
				<br>
				Our look back illustrates the ability of the technology industry 
				to adapt and lead change. At the same time, continued economic 
				volatility will require technology companies to focus on areas 
				such as cost, flexibility, operational efficiency and customer 
				management in order to sustain a prosperous, high-growth future. 
				The economic crisis already is causing realignment in the 
				technology industry, and a situation of “haves” and “have-nots” 
				is starting to emerge.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The “haves” – those that will live long and prosper </b><br>
&nbsp;<br>
				are companies that create extraordinarily flexible operating 
				models to complement good strategic plans, and that constantly 
				reevaluate both. They focus on cost management/reduction, 
				improving cash flow and working capital and controlling 
				liquidity – but not at the expense of product innovation that 
				focuses on customer needs and thereby generates revenue growth, 
				either today or in the immediate future.<br>
				<br>
				The “have-nots” are stressed companies. In order to secure their 
				future, they are restructuring and divesting assets. They also 
				focus on working capital and cash management but typically 
				require drastic remedial measures.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1">

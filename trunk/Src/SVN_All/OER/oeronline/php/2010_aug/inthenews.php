				An Nawras unveiled an exciting 
				portfolio of fixed residential services, including Home 
				Broadband &amp; Voice, all available across the Sultanate from July 
				20, 2010.</b> Nawras is now delivering new opportunities for 
				customers to get closer to friends and family with broadband 
				internet and voice access at home. Overall, 54 per cent of 
				households have coverage through the first WiMAX technology 
				network in Oman, and this is expected to grow quickly to reach 
				over 80 per cent of households during 2011.<br>
				<br>
				“As an Omani company, Nawras and its customers have benefitted 
				tremendously from the encouragement and guidance of His 
				Majesty’s leadership,” says Ross Cormack, CEO, Nawras, “By 
				entering into the fixed market, we look forward to changing the 
				telecom landscape in Oman once again, in turn supporting His 
				Majesty’s Vision 2020,” he added.<br>
				<br>
				The plug &amp; play simplicity of the Nawras Home Broadband &amp; Voice 
				packages allows customers to set up internet access within 
				minutes, and Nawras has made it easy for customers to buy, use, 
				pay and get help. Customers can simply walk into any Nawras 
				Store or selected Nawras Premium Dealer, register for the 
				service, buy a modem, take it home, connect it to a laptop or 
				desktop computer, enter their username and password, and start 
				surfing. Nawras has even posted coverage maps on its website so 
				that customers can see exactly what kinds of services are 
				covered within their town or village.<br>
				<br>
				Postpaid packages start from RO15 per month including a 6GB data 
				allowance with up to 1 Mb/s downlink speed, spend capping to 
				control broadband internet budgets, and a free-of-charge 
				telephone connection with no extra line charges – the latter 
				being an innovation and a Nawras first. Customers also benefit 
				from a number of other flexible options and price plans 
				including a prepaid service package, another Nawras first in 
				Oman.<br>
				<br>
				Starting at just RO5 per week, prepaid customers can enjoy a 2GB 
				data allowance with up to 1 Mb/s downlink speed, or can choose a 
				monthly plan with the same prices and benefits as the postpaid 
				options. Customers who sign up now for either a postpaid or 
				prepaid package will receive double data allowances absolutely 
				free plus 50 per cent off Nawras broadband modems until October 
				13 as part of the launch promotion.<br>
				<br>
				The Nawras Voice packages also offer customers a wide range of 
				different services. Customers can benefit from the transparent 
				and affordable Home Voice prices or select NawrasTalk, which 
				offers bundled minutes at a very attractive price to any other 
				Nawras fixed or mobile customer. Even better, with NawrasTalk 
				calls between Nawras fixed customers will be completely free 
				until October 13 as part of Nawras’ special launch offer. Other 
				features like the My Favourite Countries reduce rates for 
				international calls by an additional 10 per cent to two selected 
				countries.<br>
				<br>
				With the Nawras fixed telephone connection – provided free with 
				every broadband internet connection – customers enjoy even 
				better international call rates with the option of a unique 
				Nawras voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service, giving 
				further discounts to six selected destinations: India, Pakistan, 
				Bangladesh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. The first 
				residential service of its kind in Oman and another Nawras 
				first, Nawras VoIP is automatically included with the Nawras 
				Home Broadband &amp; Voice packages and simply involves dialling 
				‘0902’ before a number to switch the phone call to VoIP for that 
				call, for example, by dialling 0902 91 plus the number for calls 
				to India. Nawras VoIP offers the most attractive call rates to 
				these six Asian destinations when compared to any other player 
				in the Omani telecom market.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1">

				<b>BankDhofar</b> has emerged as the No. 1 bank in Oman Economic 
				Review-Gulf Baader Capital Markets Best Banks in Oman Survey 
				2010. BankDhofar’s resilience, determination and drive has 
				enabled it to emerge as the No.1 bank in the Sultanate. Kris 
				Babicci, CEO, BankDhofar, was presented a No.1 trophy by Sandeep 
				Sehgal, chief executive, UMS recently.<br>
				<br>
				Despite the global financial unrest during the last year 
				BankDhofar continued to achieve good results throughout 2009. 
				The total assets of the bank reached RO1,486.9mn as compared to 
				RO1,323.8mn at the end of 2008, signifying a sustained growth of 
				12.32 per cent. The net loans and advances to customers stood at 
				RO1,194.2mn compared to RO1,018.4mn in 2008 reflecting a growth 
				of 17.26 per cent. Says Babicci, “Although the region is yet to 
				fully come out of the global economic crisis, BankDhofar managed 
				reasonably well in all key areas, posting good growth rates. We 
				continued to enhance our positioning due to a focused business 
				strategy.” Anticipating an adverse economic environment the bank 
				held onto the basics coupled with strict risk management 
				practices. The bank’s approach to the challenges thrown up by 
				the financial crisis was to take stock and consolidate its 
				position in order to reduce the adverse effects of any potential 
				fallout.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1">

				education from the West and the East. “Academically we have the 
				Cambridge affiliation. And it is the only school from Shinas to 
				Tareef to be a Cambridge International Centre. We have the most 
				advanced, most extensive Maths Genius Programme which no other

				Crowne Plaza Muscat has recently been awarded an HACCP

				<b>Crowne Plaza, Muscat</b> has recently been awarded a Hazard 
				Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) certification. HACCP is 
				a systematic preventive approach to food safety and 
				pharmaceutical safety that addresses physical, chemical and 
				biological hazards. Says Herve Corvest, general manager, Crowne 
				Plaza, “HACCP reflects our focus on hygiene, sanitation and we 
				see it not merely as a process for the hotel but for the country 
				as a whole. When we apply and get an HACCP certification we 
				force our suppliers and ministries to apply similar standards in 
				the country.” Realising the benefits, all hotels in Dubai were 
				asked to become HACCP compliant a few years ago.<br>
				<br>
				Says Janet Turner, director of sales and marketing, “We are 
				protecting the interests of the local suppliers as presently 
				HACCP is not mandatory in Oman. The idea is to introduce HACCP 
				to the wider community producing food and to benefit everyone.” 
				The hotel has communicated the HACCP standards to its suppliers 
				and is enforcing them amongst them. Being an international 
				certification HACCP gives a lot of comfort to tourists when they 
				visit a country. Adds Turner, “The more health and safety 
				standards that a hotel follows, the more appealing it is for 
				international travellers, thus HACCP will help attract tourists 
				to Oman.”<br>

				<b>The process <br>
				</b>
				</font>
				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				The hotel started working on getting a HACCP certification two 
				years ago. This was further broken down into three month 
				modules. Says Gireesh Nair, executive chef, “The idea of HACCP 
				is to have traceability so that everyone is accountable for the 
				products that they are sending out into the market. It is 
				documented and there are seven implementation principles.” 
				Traceability means that if the hotel gets a complain that a 
				stake was not good then it can go back and check when it was 
				processed, from which supplier it came from, and when and where 
				it was imported from. Thus it can be traced back to the farm 
				where it was slaughtered.<br>
				<br>
				As a part of the process, the hotel started to audit suppliers 
				to make sure that they were following the standards at their 
				end. Overall, it required money, equipment and processes. The 
				hotel spent RO150,000 in getting an HACCP. Training of the staff 
				is another issue that had to be looked into as there were people 
				from different cultures speaking various languages. “We did 
				courses in Arabic and in English to familiarise people with the 
				essentials. Once the staff got trained, then we started 
				implementing the standards on the floor. Then the equipment came 
				down and we changed some of our processes,” explains Nair.<br>
				<br>
				Once the staff was comfortable with what they had achieved, 
				Crowne Plaza invited the Norwegian company (SGS) which does an 
				HACCP certification. HACCP was introduced during the moon 
				mission, as the risk of food poisoning had to be ruled out. In a 
				hotel though things are more complicated as there are numerous 
				production lines, and so the chefs have random samples kept over 
				a period of time, which are tested. The hotel has a reporting, 
				pest control, maintenance, temperature control and a reheating 
				system for the food that has been cooked. Says Nair, “The main 
				import of HACCP at the Crowne plaza is to advertise that we 
				serve safe food and we have an internationally recognised system 
				in place.” Adds Corvest, “It is where the food industry is going 
				and we would not like to catch up but be ahead of it.”</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"> <font face="Verdana" size="1">

                    <font face="Verdana" size="1">There are many benefits of 
                jogging and experts have categorised it as one of the best ways

                    Jogging is a low impact form of exercise which involves 
                running slowly at a pace of six miles per hour. It is one of the 
                best exercises for improving health and fitness. Jogging is a 
                great way to remain active and studies 
                show that jogging can reduce your chances of developing many 
                heart, bone and physical conditions. It is proven to strengthen 
                your cardiovascular systems and helps to reduce your body’s 
                excess fat. In addition to the physical benefits there are clear 
                psychological benefits as well. Jogging has a positive effect on 
                your life, relationships and coping with the pressures of work 
                becomes a lot easier. The feeling of achievement can also boost 
                self-esteem and confidence.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Beginners</b><br>
                For those who’ve been inactive for a long period, a slow build 
                up is essential. Injuries can easily occur if too much is done 
                too soon. A beginner would do better training by time spent 
                jogging rather than distance covered. As the weeks go by and 
                fitness improves, you could gradually increase that time. A good 
                jogging routine allows you to build slowly. Adding an extra five 
                minutes to the end of your jog each week might be a start. Then 
                maybe down the road, you could add a mile instead of just a few 
                minutes. Before you know it, you’ll have a good jogging routine 
                that works for you and helps you stay on track.<br>

                <b>Shoes</b><br>
                Proper running shoes enhance your performance and prevent major 
                injuries from occurring. Shoes are often a common cause of 
                injury and investing a little time (and money) on the right ones 
                can prevent a host of toe and foot problems. There’s no single 
                ‘best shoe’ and they vary as much as prescription spectacles do. 
                The best way to go about finding a good shoe would be to try 
                different brands.<br>
                <br>
                W<b>arm ups and stretches</b><br>
                Running and exercise stretches your muscles and to stretch a 
                muscle that is unprepared can cause an injury. Five to ten 
                minutes of walking or slow jogging is sufficient to prepare your 
                muscles for you jog. A similar process is suggested at the end 
                of your run to help your muscles flush out the lactic acid and 
                help your recovery. Stretching is also an important part of an 
                exercise routine. It is necessary to stave off injuries as 
                stretching flexes the muscles. Stretching also helps to ease 
                those stiffening muscles at the end of a run. The best way to 
                stick to a running schedule is to have a jogging partner. Not 
                only does having a partner motivate you, but it can also be a 
                safer option than running alone. Finally, don’t look at jogging 
                as a chore that you have to do. Look forward to your session as 
                something therapeutic and relaxing. <br>

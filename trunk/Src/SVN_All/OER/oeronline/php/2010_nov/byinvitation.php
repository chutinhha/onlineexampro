				<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Leadership coaching is now the 
				management model of choice in nearly half of the Fortune 1000 
				Corporations in North America, and that number is growing each

				<font face="Verdana" size="1">Today’s executives are faced with 
				mounting leadership issues as they navigate through 
				unprecedented global change. The issues they face are unique to 
				the 21st century: the generational shift of an aging workforce, 
				shareholder demands, increased corporate accountability and the 
				demographics of personnel with a whole new set of attitudes, 
				values and beliefs. It is this soup of complex expectations that 
				keep many executives up nights, and keep team meetings tense. 
				Today, more than ever, executives and companies require coaches.<br>
				<br>
				The impact of leadership coaching can be likened to the early 
				days of the computer: the first banks to computerise their data 
				systems and train their personnel quickly surpassed their 
				competitors. It’s the same thing with executive coaching. With 
				the world’s most successful companies using managerial coaching 
				approaches, the trend is not about to stop any time soon. <br>

				FocusSed Approach</font></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Emotional Intelligence (“EI”) relates to flexibility, planning, 
				communication and relationship skills that are necessary to 
				influence and energise employees.<br>
				<br>
				EI can be developed through the skillful redesign of internal 
				dialogue habits. All of us live inside of these internal 
				conversations and for most people, context is random and 
				therefore internal dialogue is beyond their own control and 
				‘moods happen’. Solution focused coaching is about shifting that 
				pattern by providing simple, contextual tools for approaching a 
				job with the appropriate internal talk that leads to creativity, 
				power, and success. <br>
				<br>
				This approach assists managers to set a powerful context for 
				doing any job. Most individuals have not learned how to design 
				an internal, integral, “coach position” for many of life’s 
				‘jobs’. Solution focused approaches from a skillful coach move 
				us beyond roadblocks. The best results happen when coaching 
				programmes are systemic, starting from the top leadership rung 
				and applied with the chief executive officers taking part. 
				Coaches assist to clarify motivation where it counts so that we 
				set out to learn as quickly as possible. Solution-focused 
				managerial coaching increases productivity because it puts the 
				abilities in the hands of individual leaders and teams to design 
				their own coaching results. Students take control of best 
				practices at the organisational and operational levels.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>
				Successful Implementation</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Corporate coaching leaders need to know their business well and 
				follow an integrated coaching model developed for creating 
				positive culture change. Solution focused technologies can be 
				especially powerful for this because they combine rigorous 
				training in “flow states” (recent brain-mind technologies), 
				accelerated learning tools, NLP performance technologies, simple 
				and superior assessment technologies such as 360’s, and 
				creativity skill-sets that truly develop emotional intelligence.<br>
				<br>
				Skill-based coach training is essential for managerial 
				effectiveness in these turbulent times. While it accelerates 
				emotional intelligence and effective workplace communication, it 
				also unleashes untapped creativity and innovation, which causes 
				motivation and commitment to soar. This adds up to billions of 
				dollars annually to the bottom lines of organisations.</font></td>

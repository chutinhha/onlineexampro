					growth of First Choice from a humble beginning with one 
					staff in 2000 to a 450-member strong team in 2010 has been 
					remarkable. Muneer Ahmed Sulaiman, managing director of the 
					company, ascribed this success story to two attributes which 
					he persistently adhered to throughout his professional and 
					personal life: honesty and hard work. “I always believe in 
					hard work without which you cannot achieve anything. You 
					have to be a hard worker if you want to survive in a highly 
					competitive environment,” says Sulaiman.<br>
					<br>
					He believes that honesty is an important trait for success 
					in personal and professional life. “You have to win the 
					trust of people; otherwise you cannot succeed in your 
					ventures,” he says.<br>
					<br>
					His stay and schooling in four countries have helped to 
					mould his cosmopolitan outlook towards life. “I have studied 
					in four countries- Oman, Kuwait, Egypt and the US. It was a 
					totally different experience which acquainted me with 
					different cultures and people,” Sulaiman recalls. After 
					completing his MBA from Humberside University in the UK 
					through correspondence, Sulaiman left for the US to do an 
					additional diploma in real-estate appraisal.<br>
					<br>
					</font><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
					Enterprising streak</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					Sulaiman started his professional life in Oman in 1986 and 
					then left for Dubai where he ran various artificial 
					jewellery shops. After coming back to Oman in 1990, he, 
					along with his uncle, entered into various enterprises 
					including supermarkets. It was after spending ten years with 
					his uncle that Sulaiman launched First Choice LLC, a real 
					estate company in 2000. Then the company started its 
					operation in Kuwait also after five years.<br>
					<br>
					Referring to his management style, Sulaiman says that he 
					prefers management by exception, a policy by which 
					management devotes its time to investigating only those 
					situations in which actual results differ significantly from 
					planned results. “I will not interfere if everything is 
					smooth and on expected lines. Each department functions well 
					and achieves their respective targets. I do not interfere 
					until and unless a special circumstance arises. Attention is 
					given only to material deviations requiring investigation,” 
					says Sulaiman.<br>
					<br>
					A workaholic by nature, Sulaiman has an unambiguous response 
					to the question about his time management: “You cannot 
					achieve all. You have to sacrifice something for the cost of 
					another thing which is more important for you. For the 
					success in business, which is more important for me, I have 
					to relinquish many things in other fields including personal 
					life. Besides, I enjoy doing my job, I enjoy doing business 
					and meeting people” he says.<br>
					<br>
					However he spends 15 days every year abroad, especially the 
					US which is his favourite destination, along with his 
					family. He believes that the trip helps him to recharge his 
					batteries and come back to work with renewed spirit. He also 
					likes to go out once in a while, mostly in the company of 15 
					very close friends. Sulaiman is also a lover and regular 
					watcher of western movies and Arab drama. “I would watch 
					Arab plays almost every day in the evening when I am free,” 
					he says.<br>

                    Bobby Jones, the son of a lawyer, was born into a well to 
                    do family who had a summer house near the East Lakes GC, Atlanta. 
                    The young Jones played there from the age of five and soon 
                    demonstrated a natural talent. He became junior club champion 
                    when he was just nine. He never had a formal lesson yet his 
                    swing was so smooth and powerful that professionals would 
                    later emulate it.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the turn of the century, the Majors were considered to 
                    be the British and US Opens and Amateur Championships. Jones 
                    played his first major tournament, the US Amateur, when he 
                    was 14 and finished in the top 10. However, it was not until 
                    1923 that he won his first Major, the US Open. By the time 
                    he retired from competitive golf in 1930, Jones won the Open 
                    three times, the British Amateur once, the US Open four times 
                    and the US Amateur four times. He is the only golfer to have 
                    won all the Majors in a single year in 1930. In all he won 
                    13 national championships in eight years. In addition he played 
                    in every Walker Cup since it’s inauguration in 1922 until 
                    retirement.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Unlikely hero</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><b><br>
                    </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">His talent was all 
                    the more unusual because he was not physically strong and 
                    had a nervous disposition. He chain smoked on the course, 
                    shied away from the gallery and sometimes couldn’t eat during 
                    competition time. Most people would imagine that such achievements 
                    would have necessitated a full time commitment to practice. 
                    However, Jones only devoted three months of every year to 
                    golf. The remaining time was spent acquiring first class honours 
                    degrees in Law, English Literature and Mechanical Engineering 
                    - all from different universities. When he retired he set 
                    up his own law practice in Atlanta.<br>
                    <br>
                    Jones continued his involvement in golf after retiring. He 
                    made instructional films and contributed articles to golf 
                    magazine<img src="images/img121.jpg" hspace="8" vspace="4" border="0" align="right">s. 
                    He designed Augusta National and created the US Masters Championship 
                    in collaboration. However Jones cites playing the old course 
                    St Andrews as his most rewarding golfing experience. In recognition 
                    of his contribution to golf and the Open Championship, the 
                    R&amp;A awarded him honorary membership in 1956. He was later 
                    made a freeman of St Andrews.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately in 1958, Jones became wheelchair bound due a 
                    spinal disease. When he died, a memorial service was held 
                    in his honour at St Andrews. His portrait hangs proudly in 
                    the R&amp;A clubhouse. The USGA Museum has a room dedicated 
                    to his memory.<br>
                    <br>
                    Jones won everything in golf and then he won it again. His 
                    career was short yet hugely successful. No one has achieved 
                    so much in such a short career. On that basis, he can be considered 
                    the greatest golfer ever. In addition, he competed only as 
                    an amateur and therefore demonstrated an unadulterated love 
                    for the game. Even today he sets the standard by which the 
                    greats are judged. Bobby Jones was among the first class of 
                    inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974. <br>

                    from September 12 to 14, 2004, in the Sultanate. The 
                    exhibition is being held in Oman International Exhibition 
                    Centre. This unique event combines two major 
                    exhibitions--Interiors, an exhibition of architecture, 
                    interior design and furniture, and Buildex, which is the 
                    building and construction, public works and maintenance 
                    exhibition--under one roof. <br>
                    <br>
                    The first Interiors and Buildex exhibition was held in 
                    September 2002 when the construction industry in the 
                    Sultanate started to boom. Positive feedback from past 
                    exhibitors and visitors has reflected growing confidence in 
                    this sector, which is also the inspiration for the next 
                    exhibition. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Interiors and Buildex Show is dedicated to encouraging 
                    trade and business at international level in the Sultanate 
                    and the Gulf region. The event helps to develop contacts 
                    between international manufacturers and potential investors, 
                    decision-makers and government representatives.<br>

                    with customers. The team also looked at various crucial 
                    aspects of customer service that included rising 
                    expectations and appreciating customer complaints. The

                    The bank also organised Data Warehouse Training Program, to

                    The course was aimed at creating an understanding of the 
                    concepts of customer accounts profitability. It also 
                    provided details of the basis of the Funds Transfer Pricing,

                    to greater heights in the international market with the 
                    implementation of a new regulation. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry (DG of Specifications &amp; 
                    Measurements Ð OS 1634 / 04) laid down a new regulation 
                    regarding the specifications of lubricants allowed to be 
                    marketed in Oman. The new regulation is based on globally 
                    accepted API classification of products and will be enforced 
                    with effect from September 3, 2004. <br>
                    <br>
                    SOMC's range of lubricants has the distinction of always 
                    having been above these new standards. Not all brands 
                    available in the market meet these high standards and hence 
                    have to withdraw many of their main selling grades. <br>
                    <br>
                    SOMC also has the distinction of operating the only

            <img border="0" src="im11.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="200" height="114">Samsung, 
            the regional and global leader in digital convergence technology, 
            hosted a three-day training program for its service partners in the 
            UAE last month. Designed specially for the company's optical and 
            disk drive (ODD) products comprising DVD Writers to Combo Drive, 
            CDRW and CD ROMs, the training program was attended by 11 technical 
            experts from across the Middle East and Africa region. The training 
            aimed at equipping the participants with different skill sets and 
            levels of knowledge with regard to Samsung's state-of-the-art ODD 
            products. <br>
            <br>
            Instructors from Samsung provided participants with an in depth 
            know-how of critical components within the company's optical and 
            disk drive product segments. Trainers covered all types of Samsung 
            products in this segment and also detailed practical training like 
            service procedures and major precautions adopted during product 
            servicing.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;Samsung conducts channel training programs at regular intervals as 
            part of its mission to offer unmatched support-services to our 
            consumers in the Middle East &amp; Africa&quot;, said Y.Y. Shin, general 
            manager of Samsung's Gulf Customer Satisfaction Headquarters. &quot;The 
            main objective behind the training session was to ensure that 
            Samsung service centres across the region are well equipped to offer 
            best services to customers for all our products.&quot;</font></p>

            Computers unveils new mono-processor servers </b><br>
            <img border="0" src="im12.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="149">Fujitsu 
            Siemens Computers is boosting the appeal of its entry-level 
            mono-processor servers with the first models of the new S2 series of 
            its Primergy TX150 tower server and RX100 rack server. The Primergy 
            TX150 S2 has been enhanced to operate even more economically while 
            offering better performance and reliability thanks to its sheer 
            range of functionality and integration of quality future-oriented 
            technology. The Primergy RX100 S2, meanwhile, offers ultra-compact 
            economy with its improved utility and expanded data-centre fail 
            safety. Both servers come with Server Management Suite, ensuring 
            simple installation and configuration, as well as a choice of Intel 
            Pentium 4 or Celeron processors.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The Primergy TX150 S2 is a multipurpose mono-processor server that 
            offers excellent performance and scalability and sets new class 
            standards for expansion options. It can be configured either as a 
            cost-optimised variation with new SATA technology (Serial Advanced 
            Technology Attachment), or as a SCSI version with this system's 
            renowned availability features. RAID 0, 1, 10 functionality for 
            outstanding data security is included even in the entry-level unit,&quot; 
            said Ashraf El-Arabaty, product marketing manager (Enterprise 
            Solutions), Fujitsu Siemens Computers. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The Primergy TX150 S2 with SATA technology offers a clear price 
            benefit compared to a SCSI solution, as two SATA hard disks can be 
            purchased for the same price as a single SCSI disk of equal 
            capacity. Because of the various advantages it offers, SATA 
            technology has rapidly established itself as the new interface 
            standard. These advantages are evident in configurations of two or 
            up to 4 SATA hard disks. At the same time, the Primergy TX150 S2 
            offers failsafe operation, reduced downtimes and perfect 
            serviceability since the data is backed up by means of RAID 1 
            controllers and the hot-plug capability of the hard disks,&quot; added 
            El-Arabaty. <br>
            <br>
            The Primergy TX150 S2 offers flexible entry into the world of 
            Intel-based tower servers. The choice of Ultra320 SCSI or SATA hard 
            disk technology makes the TX150 S2 the server of choice for a wide 
            variety of organizations, including mid-sized companies. Because it 
            can be integrated into 19-inch racks, the Primergy TX150 S2 can also 
            be put to use for special data centre tasks. <br>
            <br>
            The server is suited to precisely those areas where performance and 
            scalability need to go hand in hand with high system availability 
            for continuous operation. The target groups include small 
            organisations that deploy department-level servers for various tasks 
            and infrastructure services, as well as branch offices that use 
            application servers for dedicated applications. Classic areas of 
            deployment include business, industry and office applications. The 
            TX150 S2 also supports special applications. It can act as a file or 
            print server, an Internet or Intranet server, a communication server 
            for gateways, firewalls, or as a Web server.&nbsp; </font></p>

            OER about your career</b><br>
            After leaving school, I began working for Gulf Air as a Management 
            Trainee. Following one year in the airline’s management training 
            school in Bahrain, I accepted the post of Assistant Airport Manager 
            in Karachi, Pakistan. After spending five years with the airline, my 
            career path came to a crossroads. I could have taken up a position 
            as Airport Manager in Damascus, Syria responsible for setting up a 
            new route for Gulf Air. Instead, in 1987, I chose to leave Gulf Air 
            and to join Oman National Transport Company (ONTC) as DGM – 
            Operations. Two years later, I was offered a scholarship by the 
            British Council to study a postgraduate diploma course at the 
            Polytechnic of Central London (now called the University of 
            Westminster). The course was linked to a Masters programme which I 
            subsequently joined. In 1990, I successfully gained a Master of 
            Science degree in ‘Transportation for Developing Countries’. In 
            1994, I received a promotion from ONTC and assumed responsibilities 
            as Acting General Manager. One year later, I was appointed General 
            Manager of the company. I am enjoying my position as GM and have 
            since been made a fellow of the UK-based Chartered Institute of 
            Transport. <br>
            <br>
            During my employment with ONTC, I managed my own company called 
            Silver Falcon which promoted inbound tourism in Oman. It was formed 
            in 1996 and was a big success until 9/11 and the ensuing downturn in 
            the tourism economy. Subsequently, the business was forced to close.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What’s the 
            latest news from ONTC?</b><br>
            Today, with the support of His Majesty’s government, my management 
            team and I are preparing the company for privatisation. ONTC 
            recently invested a non-interest government loan of RO3.5 million 
            (about the same amount as the company’s annual turnover) on the 
            purchase of 52 super-luxury large coaches and 48 mini buses as well 
            as the creation of an automatic bus washing plant, a paint booth, 
            the upgrade of our workshops, and the complete overhaul of our 
            information technology system.<br>
            <br>
            ONTC currently operates around 275 small, medium and large luxury 
            coaches. Our company operates a public transport service throughout 
            Oman and to the UAE. The majority of our business is focused on 
            delivering charter services. Contract services are of paramount 
            importance because they are profit making and subsidise running the 
            public transport network within the country which is generally loss 
            making. <br>
            <br>
            In recent times, the expectations of customers have changed. There 
            are more players in the market on some of the profitable routes yet 
            clients demand quality at reasonable prices. Despite the increased 
            competition, ONTC has improved an already excellent service to the 2 
            million passengers it serves each year. All public transport buses 
            here are airconditioned. Additionally, some of the luxury coaches 
            which our company has acquired have state-of-the-art amenities which 
            many parts of the Middle East have yet to experience. All in all, 
            the company is growing into an exciting prospect for would-be 
            private investors.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>With budget air 
            travel appears as cheap as the buses, why choose to travel by road?</b><br>
            I believe low-income families need to be offered a choice. This is 
            particularly important in Oman where families are larger than in 
            other countries. ONTC provides reasonably priced,<br>
            comfortable and safe journeys as an alternative to other modes of 
            travel. The new budget airlines that are offering introductory 
            prices to entice customers are probably not sustainable in the long 
            run. When you look at the ease of flying as compared to bus travel, 
            there are many more conveniences with coach travel. For example, 
            ONTC offers more frequencies than budget airlines. We run express 
            services like those from Muscat to Dubai three times daily at 
            convenient timings. In addition, we are finding that Omani families 
            that used to be reluctant to use coaches for long journeys are using 
            them more frequently. Women and children are especially more 
            confident to travel alone nowadays. We ferry them to all areas of 
            Oman, particularly Sur, Ibri and Buraimi while our service to 
            Salalah from Muscat transports around 75,000 customers per year.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Which is the 
            longest coach journey you’ve taken?</b><br>
            I have travelled on the ONTC network from Muscat to Salalah before. 
            It took slightly over 10 hours. There’s a lot of beautiful 
            contrasting scenery to soak up on the journey although I took some 
            good reading material with me and had time for a catnap. Into the 
            bargain, our company is probably the biggest entertainer on this 
            route as our coaches offer passengers three films (one Arabic, one 
            Hindi and one English) to view.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>During the 
            summer, what challenges does ONTC face?</b><br>
            Summer is a big challenge. The schools are closed and there is high 
            demand between cities across Oman. Business is also good between 
            Muscat and Salalah because of Khareef season. This is offset 
            slightly by the decline in Muscat which, of course, suffers because 
            many expatriates have returned home for the holiday season.<br>
            <br>
            Due to the huge rush, there is a strain on the bus network but we 
            ensure our passengers are comfortable and we never say no to our 
            customers. We provide extra coaches to meet<br>
            with customer demand and we handle all the personal baggage that the 
            extra business brings. In fact, we operate special cargo services to 
            ensure passenger services remain safe, convenient and comfortable 
            for all who travel with us.<br>
            <br>
            For those travelling to the UAE by bus, the compulsive movement of 
            customers has been adversely effected by the Dhs100 (RO10) visa 
            charge at the UAE border post. There is also a case for speeding up 
            the visa process at the new exit/entry points which add time to our 
            coach journeys.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Is Oman’s public 
            transport system up to scratch?</b><br>
            I must admit I enjoy travelling on public transport. I’m looking 
            forward to Oman gaining an integrated multi-mode public transport 
            system because congestion is on the increase here and a recent 
            report noted that average speeds during peak hours on roads may 
            reduce to 8km/h. The best solution to this potential problem is to 
            invest more on public transport. A sound public transport policy 
            will alleviate future congestion and parking problems in Muscat.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Which car do you 
            drive?</b><br>
            I have been driving my Lexus LS400 for 10 years. I’m very happy with 
            it. It has 150,000kms on the clock. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Aside from His 
            Majesty Sultan Qaboos, which historical or business leaders have 
            impressed you?</b><br>
            I have great respect and admiration for Nelson Mandela. For a man 
            who has been incarcerated for such a long time, this leader refused 
            to compromise and held on to his beliefs. He demonstrated huge 
            determination. He was also ready to forgive and reconcile others 
            despite his imprisonment.<br>
            <br>
            I am also impressed with the achievements of Soichiro Honda, the 
            founder of Honda Motors, Japan. In 1959, he helped Honda launch a 
            50cc motorbike in the US when customer attitudes leaned towards big 
            and powerful motorbikes such as the Harley-Davidson. His boldness, 
            ingenuity and inventiveness serves as a useful role model.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Which talent 
            would you most like to have?</b><br>
            I would like to have a better talent for playing tennis. I would 
            have loved to have become one of the top 10 players in the world. 
            Nevertheless, I enjoy playing tennis and, as a Board Member of the 
            Oman Tennis Association, I organise tennis events. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What is the 
            greatest love of your life?</b><br>
            Aside from my family, I have a passion for sport. I enjoy playing 
            tennis but I am also a follower of Formula 1 racing and rally 
            racing. I like catching up on the soccer scores from time to time.
            </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What else do you 
            enjoy doing in your spare time?</b><br>
            I like 4WD wadi-bashing and mountain trekking on foot. With friends, 
            I have climbed Jebel Al Akhdar as well as completed a walk from Wadi 
            Tayyin to Quraiyat in Al Sharqiya. In the mornings, I try to go for 
            a swim in the sea before I go to work. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What is your 
            favourite motto?</b><br>
            “Be positive”. It’s easy to say it but it’s very difficult to 
            achieve a positive frame of mind and to keep a smile on your face at 
            certain times of pressure. However, this is a motto I have continued 
            to follow during my career.</font></p>

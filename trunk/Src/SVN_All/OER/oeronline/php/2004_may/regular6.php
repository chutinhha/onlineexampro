            <b>First came the five-and-a-quarter floppy discs. Then they became 
            compact and became 31/2-inch floppies. Then there were CDs, the 
            portable hard drives and a whole host of data transfer devices that 
            could be easily accommodated in your briefcase. Now you have memory 
            sticks of all shapes and sizes – pens, cards, you name it… In an era 
            when geography has become history and sharing and storing 
            information is evolving at an amazing pace — you can be sure that 
            there must have been at least one innovative product launched 
            between the time we wrote this and now, when you are reading it — 
            the world’s getting ever-so-compact. OER presents a random selection 
            of memory sticks, a small contraption with a storage capacity as big 
            as a small-town print library. For the uninitiated, a memory stick 
            is a versatile flash memory card that is one of the latest digital 
            data storage solutions in several types of digital devices, 
            including cameras, music players, voice recorders and many other 
            devices that store digital information. In short, it is an IC 
            recording media designed to record various kinds of digital content 
            on a single stick, Flash card or a Secure Digital (SD) card.</b></font></p>

            factor. This capacity enables users of digital cameras to capture 
            more high-resolution photos without having to frequently download 
            data. In addition, handheld PC users can access more applications 
            and maintain large databases while notebook users can back up and 
            transport their data more quickly and conveniently. Weighing only 16

            </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Taiwan is in an upbeat 
            mood about beating the slowdown thanks to a slew of policies 
            initiated by the Taiwanese government. A catalogue exhibition in 
            Muscat comes at the most opportune time adding to this new-found 
            exuberance, writes Visvas Paul D Karra<br>
            </b><br>
            <img border="0" src="trade.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="322">The PC and the mobile are the only two gadgets that are 
            indispensable even in the current turbulent times of cost-cuttings 
            and the ensuing frugal mentality that has become the overriding 
            sentiment. It is in this scenario that Taiwan, the world’s largest 
            manufacturer of electronic items, will bounce back in record time 
            and wipe away the dust that has been kicked up by the storm of 
            financial crisis, says Jackson T C Lee, representative of Taipei 
            Economic &amp; Cultural Office.<br>
            <br>
            According to Lee, an indicator of this upward swing is the Taiwan 
            Stock Exchange, which has seen a daily turnover of more than $3bn in 
            mid-March. Secondly, the Taiwan Semiconductor Company, the leader in 
            IT manufacturing, has recalled all its employees who were on unpaid 
            leave and will resume its 3-shift working hours from this month.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Turning around</b><br>
            Refuting a Reuters report which said that Taiwan will be emerging as 
            Asia’s most battered economies this year along with Singapore, Lee 
            said that as long as there is regular spending on essentials which 
            includes electronic gadgets like PCs and mobiles, Taiwan will combat 
            the grim situation.<br>
            <br>
            “Our government has initiated a number of steps to mitigate the 
            crisis and revitalise the economy by taking bold measures to bolster 
            financial institutions and make them resilient against the financial 
            shocks and risks. In addition to reducing the benchmark interest 
            rate, we were the first Asian nation to provide a blanket guarantee 
            for all domestic bank deposits, a move that effectively stabilised 
            the financial situation,” informed Lee. To halt the rapid 
            deterioration of the economic crisis, the Taiwan government also 
            implemented an all-in-one economic stimulus package to expand 
            investment in public infrastructure, stimulate domestic consumption, 
            boost employment, and help internationally competitive industries to 
            weather the crisis.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The China link</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="trade1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="261">In 2008, Taiwan’s relations with China also underwent a historic 
            transition with the establishment of the “Three Links” – direct air, 
            sea, and postal links. This has brought in a new era of 
            comprehensive, normalised economic relations between the two 
            neighbours and improved Taiwan’s international standing and image. 
            The cross-strait rapprochement transformed the Taiwan Strait from a 
            dangerous flashpoint to a stabilising force to the benefit of all 
            the Asian countries and allies of the two countries.<br>
            <br>
            An important event, which underscored the normalising of relations, 
            was the gifting of two giant pandas by China to Taiwan. This was 
            part of an exchange programme of endangered species, with China 
            making good on a 2005 offer. The two pandas, as a sign of 
            friendship, have been placed at the famous Taipei Zoo. “These 
            positive signs have shown the positive way of future cooperation,” 
            Lee affirmed.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Purchasing power</b><br>
            The representative of Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Office in Oman is 
            also upbeat about the 144 per cent growth in exports from Taiwan to 
            Oman, which presently stands at $9.5mn as of January 2009 with an 
            overall growth of 50 per cent. Lee says that this huge jump in 
            exports to Oman only points to two things – the resilience of the 
            Omani economy and the strong purchasing power that the Sultanate has 
            retained despite the gloomy global situation.<br>
            <br>
            The top ten category of products that have been exported from Taiwan 
            to Oman include plastic; electronic and engineering parts; boiler 
            and machine parts; steel, automobile spares; steel products; 
            chemical products; sulfur, minerals, marble, cement; rubber; and low 
            level metal products.<br>
            <br>
            Taking into account Oman’s strong macro-economic fundamentals, the 
            Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Office in Oman is organising the 
            “Taiwanese Product Catalogue Show” from April 20-21, 2009 at the 
            Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) Head Office, Muscat, 
            and April 23, 2009 in OCCI, Salalah. This exhibition is being 
            organised in coordination with the Taiwan External Trade Development 
            Council (TAITRA) and OCCI.<br>
            <br>
            “If you look at the huge jump in exports to Oman, we realise that 
            Oman has a huge business potential and a lot of wealth. However, 
            many Taiwanese companies are unwilling to come here, so far for 
            various reasons like language barrier and lack of direct flights. 
            Therefore, I am organising this catalogue exhibition. It is a good 
            opportunity for Omani companies to make contact with Taiwan 
            companies by visiting the catalogue exhibition,” Lee pointed out. 
            The catalogues to be exhibited will focus on building materials, 
            machinery, PC and by products, mobile phones, furniture, and house 
            wares. More than 300 Taiwanese companies are participating in this 
            exhibition.<br>
            <br>
            “Last year we had around 270 companies which had participated in 
            this catalogue exhibition and this year we are expecting the number 
            to double. However I would like to stress on the fact that our 
            office is open to all Omani businessmen to walk in and find out how 
            best they can form joint ventures and partnerships with their 
            Taiwanese counterparts,” says Lee.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Business made easy<br>
            </b>Since China and Taiwan have recognised each other’s currency and 
            postal stamps, it will be easier to communicate and commute from the 
            mainland to Taiwan. It will facilitate easier business transactions 
            and in turn make travelling to Taiwan easier for Omanis.<br>
            <br>
            According to Lee, in the business world it is important to have an 
            echo. “The Omani entrepreneurs should come forward to take advantage 
            of the vast technology-expertise that Taiwan has on offer for 
            example in agriculture and aquaculture,” Lee says.<br>
            <br>
            The OCIPED (Oman Centre for Investment Promotion and Export 
            Development) and the OCCI should play a greater role in facilitating 
            this ‘echo’ process, he said.<br>
            <br>
            Lee also disclosed that there are organisations like the Taiwan 
            Turnkey Project Association whose purpose is to provide services for 
            entrepreneurs looking for turnkey solutions and gain support from 
            the government and promote themselves. This organisation will 
            provide all the necessary help to Omanis who are looking for 
            one-stop solutions to do business with Taiwanese companies.</font></p>

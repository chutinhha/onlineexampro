                <b>The potential for solar power was flagged in June 2008 with 
                the release of the country’s first extensive study on the 
                feasibility of renewable resources, undertaken by the Authority 
                for Electricity Regulation, Oman (AERO). It concluded that even 
                despite the higher cost of capital, solar power should be 
                utilised for electricity and water production<br>
                </b><br>
                <img border="0" src="eco.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="125" height="148">Cutting the fat’ – that is losing extraneous expenses – is a 
                term being echoed around the globe as consumers, companies and 
                governments alike adjust to a serious depletion of liquidity and 
                demand across all sectors. Many national budgets in 2009 are 
                operating bare-bones style, where basics like public utilities, 
                infrastructure gain increased prominence over more complicated 
                and costly goods and services such as top-end real estate. In 
                the Middle East, the money will naturally flow where it is most 
                needed. One such area is power generation capacity – recent 
                estimates hold that the region needs $500bn worth of electricity 
                infrastructure meet demand for power over the coming years. <br>
                <br>
                While the global economy remains sluggish, Oman and other states 
                across the Gulf region can capitalise on the lull by building up 
                public works infrastructure so that when business inevitably 
                picks up, power supply concerns will be a thing of the past. In 
                Oman, the real interest of this progression lies in the extent 
                to which the Sultanate will reinvent its power infrastructure 
                away from natural gas and toward renewable resources.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Work in progress <br>
                </b>With an arid climate and rapidly growing industrial sector, 
                Oman is well-acquainted with power and water supply concerns. 
                The Sultanate has been designing capacity-building solutions 
                long before the 2008 credit crisis began. The state-owned Oman 
                Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) is currently 
                overseeing five privately financed independent water and power 
                projects (IWPPs) in various stages of development. Scheduled to 
                come online over the next four or five years, these will 
                collectively contribute about 3,900 additional MW to the 
                nation’s current power generation capacity of about 3,031 MW, as 
                well as approximately 78mn imperial gallons per day (MIGD) of 
                water supply. <br>
                <br>
                The new capacity will help to quench Oman’s growing appetite for 
                electricity, which, in its annual seven-year statement released 
                last March, the OWPP estimated to be increasing by about 10 per 
                cent each year. But, as all are powered by either natural gas or 
                coal, they will not aid Oman’s quest toward a greener economy, a 
                main tenet of its Vision 2020 development plan.<br>
                <br>
                Currently, all electricity in Oman is generated by liquefied 
                natural gas (LNG), but the government has made clear its 
                intention to diversify away from LNG due to its price 
                volatility, low domestic supply and environmental damage. The 
                ‘all-gas’ strategy is problematic in the medium-to-long term for 
                obvious reasons. Even with new LNG supplies being pumped in from 
                Qatar via the Dolphin Gas Project, demand stands to outpace 
                supply. Moreover, natural gas is a distinctly finite resource – 
                sooner or later systemic changes must be undertaken. <br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="eco1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="222" height="598">In the short term, Oman is not likely to experience a 
                significant decrease in energy demand despite the tempered 
                economy. The RO800mn that is earmarked for project spending in 
                2009 should ensure that development continues apace. The 
                government is working against the tide of the global economic 
                downturn, providing energy-intensive industrial and development 
                projects with the fiscal sustenance needed to sustain what looks 
                to be a prolonged and severe recession. But while 
                diversification of feedstock for electricity and desalinated 
                water (which is often produced in tandem with electricity) is 
                certainly on the government’s agenda, it is not yet clear 
                exactly what kind of resource scheme it will choose.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Alternative sources of energy <br>
                </b>With an eco-friendly mentality that is fast becoming one of 
                its landmarks, the Sultanate has been seriously investigating 
                the merits of solar and wind power. Perhaps in a sign of things 
                to come, the Public Authority for Electricity and Water (PAEW) 
                is expected to release a tender for consultancy for the 
                country’s first solar energy power plant in March. <br>
                <br>
                The potential for solar power was flagged in June 2008 with the 
                release of the country’s first extensive study on the 
                feasibility of renewable resources, undertaken by the Authority 
                for Electricity Regulation, Oman (AERO). It concluded that even 
                despite the higher cost of capital, solar power should be 
                utilised for electricity and water production. Wind power is 
                also considered to have potential, though its implementation is 
                generally limited by technical reasons. By AERO’s estimations, 
                solar power could theoretically provide for the country’s 
                current electricity consumption of 13900GW and also produce some 
                electricity for export by installing solar collectors on 280km2 
                of desert area, or 0.1 per cent of the Sultanate’s land area. As 
                an added bonus, solar potential is highest during the summer, 
                when energy demand is at its peak, said the study.<br>
                <br>
                Oman has one of the highest levels of solar energy density in 
                the world – given the right technology, this plentiful (and 
                free) resource could hypothetically power the nation. Serious 
                impediments to large-scale solar power adoption remain though. 
                Perhaps the most daunting are the high initial capital costs. At 
                the moment, long run capital costs also remain higher than 
                traditional fossil fuel systems. <br>
                <br>
                The price difference between the solar and gas-powered 
                electricity is indeed jarring. According to the 2008 study on 
                renewable energy by AERO, newly constructed natural gas fired 
                production costs average $18/MWh for combined cycle gas turbines 
                and $24/MWh for open cycle gas turbines (based on a gas price of 
                $1.5/MMBtu). A solar thermal plant, on the other hand, currently 
                averages $207/MWh. Photovoltaic systems produce energy at a cost 
                of $250-425, depending on the type of system used.<br>
                <br>
                Dropping oil and gas prices have caused the financial incentive 
                to go green to evaporate somewhat. But as we learned in 2008, 
                commodity prices are hard to predict – gas is already showing 
                signs of resurgence and could very well experience another steep 
                climb, putting a strain on utility production in the future. 
                Meanwhile, as with all nascent technology, green energy systems 
                will inevitably increase in efficiency and decrease in cost over 
                the medium-to-long term. The solar power of course dovetails 
                nicely with the commitment to environmental health that features 
                prominently in Vision 2020. Clean energy infrastructure also 
                earns Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) – carbon credits 
                awarded by the UN that can be traded in a global cap and trade 
                carbon system – that essentially act as financing for green 
                projects. If the United States joins the global carbon market 
                under President Obama, a likely move, the market for and value 
                of such credits will increase dramatically.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Green initiatives</b><br>
                Solar power programmes also provide significant opportunities 
                for job creation and Omanisation, a persistent and significant 
                issue in the future sustainability of the economy. The 
                environmental market in the Middle East, of which energy takes a 
                large share, is worth an estimated $12bn. Once the government 
                gets the ball rolling, green energy initiatives would most 
                likely attract much attention from the private sector, even in a 
                difficult economic environment, bringing jobs and technical 
                training to the Sultanate.<br>
                <br>
                Some worry that green initiatives will suffer under the tight 
                liquidity markets of 2009. But if the global recession has 
                dampened enthusiasm for the greening of economies in the region, 
                it doesn’t show. The UAE and Abu Dhabi in particular remain 
                committed to eco-friendly projects both large and small, solar 
                panel shades on parking lots to the Masdar project, an 
                emissions-free city within a city. The emirates’ commitment to 
                green technology is a hopeful sign of the region’s political 
                commitment to a clean energy overhaul.<br>
                <br>
                There is no question that Oman will need to continually expand 
                its power infrastructure in order to keep up with future demand. 
                As the Sultanate will surely continue to invest in large-scale 
                investments, utility sector players of all types – from gas to 
                solar companies – will be keeping a close eye on government 
                plans. The dim world economy of this year, and possibly next, 
                might be an ideal time for Oman to make systemic changes to its 
                energy sector and step out of the shade and into the sun.

                <img border="0" src="close.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="125" height="148">Notwithstanding uncertainties related to on-going financial 
                crisis, Saudi Arabia’s budget for 2009 is generous on spending, 
                and for good reasons. Steady spending is vital for registering 
                highest possible growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP) on 
                the back of expected drop in private sector investments 
                resulting from confidence problems. To be sure, public spending 
                is uniquely significant in Saudi Arabia by virtue of comprising 
                nearly one third of the country’s GDP. Saudi Arabia’s GDP 
                amounts to $382bn in market prices and $555bn on purchasing 
                power parity (PPP) basis.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Solid expenditures</b><br>
                Projected expenditures amount to $126bn, up by 15 per cent 
                versus originally planned figure for fiscal year 2008. However, 
                actual spending in fiscal 2008 was augmented by nearly 25 per 
                cent thanks to firm oil prices during the first half of the 
                year.<br>
                <br>
                Surprisingly, the budget is not necessarily conservative with 
                regards
                to income. Customarily, Saudi authorities tend to underestimate 
                revenue as part of a deliberate conservative policy.<br>
                <br>
                Revenues for fiscal year 2009 amount to $109bn, merely $11bn 
                less than the original figure for 2008. Observers were expecting 
                lower income figure due to the extraordinary drop in oil prices 
                from a record $147 per barrel in June 2008 to around $40 per 
                barrel lately.<br>
                <br>
                Fortunately, the government allocated a hefty $60bn for 
                developmental projects in 2009. The figure is sizable by virtue 
                of comprising some 47 per cent and 55 per cent of total 
                projected expenditures and revenues, respectively. Projects 
                include expansion of road network and new power and water 
                plants. Such investments should help the objective of avoiding 
                the turning of financial crisis into an economic one.<br>
                <br>
                At the same time, firmer public spending stands to stimulate 
                private sector investors. Traditionally, private investors take 
                the lead from the government with regards to economic 
                directions. Accordingly, private sector investors adopt 
                conservative spending in case of contraction in public sector 
                expenditures, in turn suggesting tough times ahead. <br>
                <br>
                <b>No debt problem<br>
                <img border="0" src="close1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="387"></b>Actual statistics for 2008 changed dramatically from 
                projected ones, something not likely to be repeated anytime 
                soon. Actual revenues increased by a hefty 144 per cent from 
                $120bn to $293bn. Also, total expenditures rose from $109bn to 
                $136bn. As a result, the kingdom posted a record $157bn surplus. 
                In retrospect, Saudi Arabia registered a surplus of $71bn in 
                2006, the highest historically recorded at the time.<br>
                <br>
                Gladly, the authorities opted to use part of surplus achieved 
                last year to help reduce outstanding debt. More specifically, 
                debt was reduced to 19 per cent of GDP in 2008, down from 19 of 
                GDP in 2007, thereby continuing the trend of doing away with 
                public arrears. Still, the debt figure compares favourably with 
                a key condition attached to planned implementation in 2010 of 
                monetary union project amongst Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
                countries. Amongst others, member states are required to limit 
                public debt to 60 per cent of gross domestic product (Oman has 
                opted not to join the monetary union initiative).<br>
                <br>
                <b>First things first </b><br>
                Priorities projected figures for fiscal year 2009 call for a 
                deficit of $17bn. If recorded, the shortfall would mark the 
                first of its kind since 2002. The possibility of actual 
                budgetary deficit could not be ruled out in the light of 
                prevailing oil prices in international markets. Yet, the deficit 
                comprises nearly 4.5 per cent of GDP, which violates the three 
                per cent limit prescribed for the planned monetary union.<br>
                <br>
                By one account, Saudi Arabia enjoys some $300bn in the form of 
                sovereign wealth funds (SWF). Similar to other fellow GCC 
                members, the kingdom succeeded in strengthening its SWF over the 
                last few years on the back of firm oil prices. The petroleum 
                sector contributes more than two thirds of Saudi’s treasury 
                income. Needless to say, time is ripe for Saudi authorities to 
                use part of reserves accumulated over the last few years to 
                address economic challenges.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Positive spillover effects<br>
                </b>Stronger spending together with resulting improvement in 
                economic conditions should help the authorities to address high 
                unemployment levels. According to the Ministry of Economy and 
                Planning, the unemployment rate amongst national workforce stood 
                at 11.2 per cent in the first half of 2007. In reality, Saudi 
                Arabia’s eighth development plan calls for reducing unemployment 
                rate dropping from 7 per cent in 2004 to merely 2.8 per cent by 
                2009.<br>
                <br>
                Saudi authorities are under pressure to create 160,000 jobs 
                annually for nationals entering the job market. <br>
                <br>
                Demographic statistics add to pressures since about half of 
                locals are below the age of 20. Undoubtedly, many would be 
                entering the job markets in the next few years looking for 
                suitable employment. One such resolution for doing away 
                unemployment amongst locals relates to restricting certain jobs 
                to Saudi nationals. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 
                restricts some 40 jobs to locals. These include taxi drivers, 
                training and purchasing managers, public relations officers, 
                administrative assistants, secretaries, operators, debt 
                collectors, customer service accountants, tellers, postmen, data 
                handlers, librarians, booksellers, ticket kiosk keepers, auto 
                salesmen, janitors, internal mail handlers and tour guides.<br>
                <br>
                In addition, the authorities allocated 25 per cent and 8 per 
                cent of expenditures to education and heath, respectively. Such 
                planned expenditures should help improving the country’s 
                position on human development index (HDI), in turn issued by the 
                United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Saudi Arabia 
                clinched 55th position amongst 177 nations ranked in 2008 
                report. In fact, this was the lowest result amongst GCC 
                countries. Kuwait topped GCC list by ranking number 29 
                worldwide. The report ranks countries on the basis of their 
                performance on three variables, namely life expectancy at birth, 
                education and income on purchasing power parity basis. Stronger 
                spending on education and health should help improving Saudi 
                Arabia’s ranking on HDI. <br>
                <br>
                In short, steady public sector spending should help in achieving 
                several challenges including creating enough employment 
                opportunities for locals amidst anticipated drop in private 
                sector investments in the aftermath of global credit crunch.<br>

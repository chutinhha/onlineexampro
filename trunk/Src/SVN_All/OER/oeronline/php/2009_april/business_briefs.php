                chances to win 10 times more and daily prizes of RO10,000 and 
                RO1,000 throughout the year. The new scheme is based on 
                scientific research done on customer expectations. “Built on 
                trust and transparency, the all-new al Mazyona stands out with 
                its daily promise of fulfilling dreams every day of the year.

                build up day after day, all through the year, offering 
                innumerable winning chances to all. The scheme has been tailored

                balance in their savings amount. The scheme, applicable on all

                Celebrating four years serving Oman, Nawras held its anniversary 
                event with its customers. The celebration took place in the car 
                park of the company’s main office. Passers-by including Nawras 
                Store visitors were surprised when they received an impromptu 
                invitation to the party. A group of employees, CEO Ross Cormack 
                and COO Khalid Al-Mahmoud, jointly performed the ceremonial task 
                of cutting one of the largest cakes ever to be baked in Oman. 
                Four tiers of confectionary were then shared out amongst the 
                assembled Nawras family members and all those in the vicinity. 
                “Nawras has always shown a deep respect for Omani culture in all 
                forms so it was fitting that a traditional Omani band provided 
                the event’s musical entertainment. Blending tradition and the 
                latest technology has proved to be a successful combination for 
                this award-winning communications provider,” a release from 
                Nawras stated. On display was the latest Yukon four wheel drive 
                vehicle which is the grand prize in the exciting fourth 
                anniversary draw. Every time a customer spends RO4, they have a 
                chance to win and multiple entries can be made until the closing 
                date of May 13, 2009.<br>

                  Crisis</font></font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  <img border="0" src="bus1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="198">Chairman of Renaissance Services, Samir J. Fancy, commenting 
                  on the strong 2008 results of the company has said, 
                  “Renaissance’s focus on delivering consistent and sustainable 
                  growth through its existing operations has resulted in a 
                  strong performance for the 2008.” Commenting on the current 
                  crisis in the global economy, Fancy added, “Every crisis 
                  reshapes economic environments, bringing with it massive 
                  accelerated change. Companies that adapt will survive and 
                  thrive. There are predictable surprises and many unpredictable 
                  ones – flexibility matters. Global Corporate Leader Boards 
                  change and household names disappear, while well run aspiring 
                  corporations rise. The thing is, at Renaissance, I see a quiet 
                  but determined belief developing amongst its leadership – a 
                  body language that suggests to me – we will not waste this 
                  crisis.”<br>
                  <br>
                  He also said that the consequence of continued focus on 
                  Renaissance’s values-driven operating model is yet another 
                  year of growth and record financial performance. Better 
                  margins, growth in operations and capital gains resulted in 
                  higher earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE). 
                  EPS has increased to RO0.103 ($0.267) and ROE has also 
                  increased to 21.2 per cent compared to 17.2 per cent in 2007. 
                  The Renaissance balance sheet, with total Shareholders’ funds 
                  of more than $360mn, is well positioned to support future 
                  growth plans. Fancy’s statement, reflecting the current 
                  uncertainty in world financial markets, dedicated a sizeable 
                  section to how it would meet the challenges of the global 
                  recession, citing new contracts, current assets at operational 
                  capacity, secure financing and payments, and close to the 
                  customer ethos as focuses for better performance in 2009.<br>
                  <br>
                  Renaissance suggests full confidence that it has the liquidity 
                  and appropriate business mix to remain resilient and 
                  growth-oriented in a more difficult and less predictable 
                  business environment. Though Renaissance Services market is 
                  predominately oil and gas, the Chairman stated, 
                  “interestingly, oil price generally has little effect on our 
                  ongoing performance.”</font></p>

                  is financed by DVB Bank of Germany. The vessel will be 
                  deployed in the Caspian Sea in support of a ten-year $225mn

                  The overall length is 73.6 meters with a moulded beam of 16 
                  meters and will be mobilized from Denmark to Baku in

                  in our growth by our bankers.” The contract was won in 
                  September 2008 in competition with several global players. An

</b>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<img border="0" src="scan1.jpg" width="75" height="133" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the world’s largest soft-drink distributor, will cut 
3,500 jobs after posting its worst loss in a decade. The fourth-quarter loss was 
$1.71 billion, or $3.59 a share, the Atlanta-based bottler said in a statement. 
Most of the cuts, as part of the restructuring of the company’s North American 
operations, will come from not filling open positions, spokeswoman Laura Asman 
said. Coca-Cola Enterprises employs 73,000 workers. Coca-Cola CEO John Brock 
struggled to halt soda declines in the US as consumers switch to ‘healthier’ 
drinks. The bottler raised prices in North America by 3 per cent in response to 
higher costs of aluminium and sweetener. That caused volumes to drop by 2.5 per 
cent, the worst in almost two years for the unit.<br>
<br>
The company took a non-cash charge of $3.80 a share to reduce the value of its 
franchise licenses for bottlers it had purchased more than a decade ago. The 
company forecast 2007 earnings per share to fall between 5 and 10 per cent as 
compared to $1.30 a share in 2006. That indicates a profit next year of between 
$1.17 and $1.24 a share. Coca-Cola Enterprises will save $50 million to $100 
million in 2007, and an additional $100 million to $125 million by 2008 because 
of the job cuts and restructuring, Chief Financial Officer Bill Douglas said.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

Economic growth in the countries that use the euro jumped last year and reached 
its highest annual rate in six years. The EU statistics office Eurostat 
estimates that GDP expanded by 2.7 per cent, nearly double the 1.4-per cent 
expansion seen in 2005. The European Commission has already said it will 
probably raise its current forecast of 2.1 per cent growth in 2007. Growth 
rebounded in last three months of 2006 and reached 0.9 per cent, the same as 
during the second quarter and a major improvement on the 0.5 per cent of the 
third quarter. Germany enjoyed 2.7 per cent growth last year compared with 0.9 
per cent in 2005. The growth rate in France rose from 1.2 per cent to 2 per 
cent. Italy – where the economy had stagnated in 2005 – also managed a 2 per 
cent expansion. The region’s growth does not appear to have been damaged by the 
European Central Bank’s interest rate increases.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the latest figures make it more likely that there will be another rise 
in March. The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Joaquin 
Almunia, said the economy is coping well with the euro’s strengthening against 
the dollar and the yen.<br>

<img border="0" src="scan2.jpg" width="100" height="126" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Symantec, the world’s largest PC antivirus maker, has unleashed Norton 360, the 
company’s latest salvo in the battle for consumer security dollars. Norton 360 
is Symantec’s new flagship consumer security product, unseating its Norton 
Internet Security suite. First announced a year ago under the Genesis code name, 
Norton 360 includes a host of technologies, many from Symantec’s current 
security, PC optimisation and backup products. Yet Symantec said it didn’t just 
cobble together existing wares for Norton 360; many of the features are 
brand-new. “It is all-in-one security for the mainstream PC user who wants a 
product that is going to take care of things for them,” said Tom Powledge, 
director of product management at Symantec. “We didn’t want to make it a big old 
kitchen sink. We’re not playing the feature game. We want to make the features 
right for every customer.”<br>
<br>
Norton 360 is designed to compete with the latest products from McAfee as well 
as security newcomer Microsoft, which shipped Windows Live OneCare last May. 
Following Microsoft’s lead, all of the latest security products combine basic 
antivirus, antispyware and firewall technologies with backup features and 
several tune-up tools for Windows PCs – features Symantec and McAfee 
traditionally charged extra for.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

Computing took a leap forward when chipmakers started putting more than one core 
– or central brain – on a single chip. It was a way to make machines work harder 
even as they consumed less power. Now, chip-making giant Intel (INTC) has said 
it has successfully produced a chip with 80 cores, the size of a fingernail, 
capable of processing a mind-boggling 1 trillion calculations a second.<br>
<br>
The chip, which Intel claims is the fastest ever made, could start being used 
commercially in “five years, if not sooner.” The massive processing power each 
chip would provide will dramatically change the way consumers and businesses 
work and play. For example, financial analysis that takes days to perform in 
back offices could be done in seconds at a trader’s terminal on Wall Street. The 
test chip, which does not yet use the standard x86 architecture common to most 
PCs and servers, consumes an average 62 watts of energy—less than some chips on 
the market today. It also takes a novel approach of stacking memory in three 
dimensions directly on top of the chip, creating an architecture that would 
transfer information at lightning speed.<br>

Sleeping a little over half-an-hour in the middle of the day may reduce the risk 
of heart diseases, particularly in healthy young men, say researchers. 
Mid-afternoon naps are often taken after a mid-day meal. Such a period of sleep 
is a common tradition in countries with hot climate. Dimitrios Trichopoulos from 
the Harvard School of Public Health and other researchers looked at 23,681 men 
and women aged between 20 and 86 who did not have a history of heart disease or 
any other severe condition. The six-year-long Greek study took into account ill 
health, age and physical activities of the participants, who were asked if they 
took mid-day naps and how often.<br>
<br>
They were also asked about their dietary habits. The researchers found that 
those who took naps of any frequency and duration had a 34 per cent lower risk 
of dying from heart disease than those who did not take mid-day naps. Those who 
took naps of more than 30 minutes, three or more times a week, had a 37 per cent 
lower risk. Among working men who took mid-day naps, there was a 64 per cent 
reduced risk of death compared with a 36 per cent reduced risk among non-working 
men. Experts said napping during the afternoon might help people relax by 
reducing their stress levels. The researchers added that if backed by other 
trials, taking a siesta would be an interesting way of reducing heart disease, 
as it had no side effects. The only factor was that people should not reduce the 
amount of physical activity they did during the rest of the day.

<font face="Verdana" size="1">WPP on expansion spree in Middle East<br>
<br>
WPP Group Plc, the world’s second biggest marketing services company, is getting 
aggressive in the Middle East. Group CEO Martin Sorrel recently stated that the 
group is seeking to expand its equity interests in the Middle East by acquiring 
more shares in its regional partners and by buying into more agencies. He made 
it clear that his goal is to acquire controlling stakes in WPP’s partnerships in 
the region. WPP has partnerships with local companies in ad agencies, including 
Bates Pan-Gulf Group, Grey Worldwide, Memac Ogilvy &amp; Mather, JWT MENA, Team Y&amp;R; 
media agencies including Mediaedge CIA and Mediacom, and the regional branch of 
PR agency Hill &amp; Knowlton. It also has indirect stakes in the regional offices 
of media agencies Mindshare and Media Insight, the 50-50 joint ventures of Memac 
Ogilvy and JWT MENA. As per market reports, Sorrel is negotiating with one or 
more agencies for acquisition in the region. The expansion of Ogilvy Healthworld 
in the region is also on the cards.<br>

‘Windows’ on the Web<br>
The web is where it is all happening – or so internet pundits tell us. The 
applications that we use on our desktop or laptop personal computers will 
eventually all migrate to the web, they say. Indeed, players such as Google 
already offer their users the ability to create and save documents and 
presentations entirely through a browser. But it’s still something happening 
piece-meal and in driblets. Now, an India-based start-up, fuelled by the 
creative efforts of a dozen young Indian programmers, has boldly gone where no 
major player has gone before. It has just announced the ‘world’s first 
Windows-based online desktop.’ It’s called Nivio and helps one to create a 
full-fledged, but entirely virtual, desktop of one’s own – on the web. Those who 
register for a trial of the beta or advanced prototype get the full Windows XP 
look and feel; 5 gigabytes of storage, and all the standard desktop features 
such as file back-up, virus and spam protection. The free bundle of software 
tools includes the OpenOffice suite, Outlook Express email tool and the Internet 
Explorer browser. Also on offer are Acrobat 8 reader, iTunes and Winamp players, 
Yahoo Messenger, and for open software lovers, the choice of a Mozilla/Firefox 
browser and the Foxit Reader.<br>
Airline industry profitability improves<br>
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced a US$5 billion 
projected profitability for airlines in 2007. IATA Director General and CEO 
Giovanni Bisignani said, “The industry has changed tremendously in five years. 
Labour productivity is up 56 per cent. Distribution costs are down 13 per cent. 
Non-fuel unit costs dropped 15 per cent and load factors are at record highs – 
76 per cent in 2006. Airlines needed an oil price of less than US$20 per barrel 
in 2002 to break even. Today we are profitable at nearly US$70 per barrel.” 
While the results are encouraging, Bisignani also sounded a word of caution. 
“Airlines are a US$470-billion industry. A profit of US$5 billion is peanuts. We 
need US$40 billion just to cover the cost of capital. The industry is moving in 
the right direction, but with US$200 billion of debt, the financial hole is 
deep. The challenge is to turn the peanuts into sustainable profits.”<br>
Global energy consumption continues to grow<br>
The year 2006 saw high and volatile energy prices. But despite high prices, 
world energy consumption growth remained above average in keeping with recent 
trends. Energy use is also increasingly shifting away from OECD countries and 
becoming more carbon-intensive. These are the main findings from the BP 
Statistical Review of World Energy 2007. It was a year when energy markets were 
once again the centre of attention, attracting the interest of politicians, 
consumers and policy-makers alike. “Last year showed markets at work. Primary 
energy consumption growth has decelerated – particularly for fuels which have 
seen the highest increase in price,” said BP’s chief economist-designate 
Christof Rühl. “However, global carbon intensity – the link between carbon 
emissions growth and energy growth – has increased.” For the second year in a 
row, world energy growth slowed, rising by 2.4 per cent, down from 3.2 per cent 
in 2005, but still just above the 10-year average. The pattern of recent years, 
which has seen robust demand in Asia Pacific and China in particular, was 
repeated with Chinese energy consumption rising more than 8 per cent. China’s 
usage of all forms of energy rose in the year, taking the country’s share of 
total global consumption to more than 15 per cent.<br>
US economy growth slows down to 0.7 per cent in Q1 <br>
The US economy grew at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of 
2007, much slower than the 2.5 per cent pace in the final quarter of last year, 
marking the weakest showing in more than four years. The growth rate in real 
gross domestic product – the output of goods and services produced by labour and 
property located in the United States – was slightly higher than the 0.6 per 
cent pace previously estimated. The final reading disappointed economists. The 
deceleration in real GDP growth in the first quarter primarily reflected an 
upturn in imports, a deceleration in exports, a downturn in federal government 
spending, and a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures for <br>
non-durable goods. <br>

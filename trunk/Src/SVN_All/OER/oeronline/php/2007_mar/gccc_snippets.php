GIC ‘06 profits to exceed US$600 mn<br>
The Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC) announced a 120 per cent year-on-year 
increase in net profits to US$600.1 million, up from US$272.8 million in 2005, 
the highest in its history.<br>
Consequently, return on average shareholders’ equity of approximately 42.9 per 
cent for the year went up by 16.4 per cent over the previous year, reaching 
US$1.9 billion. Total assets grew by 9 per cent to US$8.1 billion during 2006. 
With the calling of US$250 million of the unpaid capital, the GIC’s paid-up 
capital reached US$1 billion, a significant milestone, said GIC. The 
corporation, owned equally by six GCC states, declared a dividend of US$236 
million for 2006, approximately 31.5 per cent of its paid-up capital.<br>
Chairman of the Board, H.E. Dr Yousef Hamad Al Ebraheem, said, “This is the 
sixth consecutive year of profit growth subsequent to the strategic 
reorientation initiated in 2001, with net profits growing by several multiples 
during this period.” GIC has emerged as a powerful player in the region, winning 
major projects in Power, Utilities and other sectors, competing with 
international players at the highest level, Al Ebraheem added.<br>
“Recording a 155 per cent increase in gross operating income, the key 
contributor to net income continued to be ‘Projects’, a core business of the 
corporation,” said Hisham Al Razzuqi, Chief Executive Officer. “Strategic 
investments in the steel and chemicals sectors provided handsome returns, 
boosted by the strong economic growth in the GCC region,” he added.<br>
Healthy profit growth was also recorded within the portfolio of trading 
securities, the alternative assets portfolio, while recording enhanced fee-based 
income. Total investments and commitments in the GCC region at the end of 2006 
reached US$3.2 billion, 38 per cent of the total assets.<br>
Investment in projects is central to growth strategy, and assets within this 
business grew to US$1.07 billion, said GIC. The new investments during the year 
include participation in two major Power &amp; Utilities projects in Saudi Arabia, 
establishment of a holding company in Bahrain to consolidate interests within 
the Metals sector, investment in a major construction company in Qatar and 
several other projects within the GCC. <br>
GIC said it has a Tier I capital ratio of 20.9 per cent and a total capital 
ratio of 22.1 per cent as per Basel II guidelines. The corporation has an 
authorised capital of US$2.1 billion.<br>
Kuwait Finance House venture with Pacific Holdings<br>
The private equity division of Kuwait Finance House (Malaysia), Berhad, and 
Pacific Healthcare, an integrated healthcare provider with operations in 
Singapore, Hong Kong, India and China, have signed a joint venture agreement to 
invest up to S$32 million either in cash, or through the injection of 
synergistic businesses to establish new medical centres in the region.<br>
KFHMB and PHH have set up Aliph Pacific Pte Ltd, which will serve as the 
investment vehicle for the expansion of healthcare businesses in Asia. The joint 
venture will establish or model these healthcare facilities in line with PHH’s 
successful Singapore operations–with provision of integrated and 
multi-disciplinary specialist healthcare, including dermatology, dentistry, 
women’s healthcare and diagnostic imaging. Hospital management and consultancy 
are other areas the company will cover, the companies said.<br>
Several healthcare projects have been earmarked for the joint venture, the 
companies said. KFHMB has targeted healthcare as one of its core investment 
sectors and has identified Pacific Healthcare as an ideal strategic partner, 
said Mr K Salman Younis, Managing Director of Kuwait Finance House (Malaysia), 
Berhad.<br>
“Kuwait Finance House has the expertise in Islamic banking and finance as well 
as experience of healthcare ventures in Kuwait and India. We are therefore able 
to complement the technical know-how and premier quality healthcare services 
that Pacific Healthcare provides to consumers. The collaboration is indeed in 
line with our commitment to share our experiences in the Middle East with 
various industries in this part of the world,” he added.<br>
Dr William Chong, CEO of Pacific Healthcare said: “We believe that our 
partnership with Kuwait Finance House will allow us to cement our position as a 
premier healthcare provider in the region and further expand our brand 
internationally. Aliph is the first letter in the Arabic alphabet and the choice 
of the name for the company, Aliph Pacific Pte Ltd., reflects our intention to 
be at the forefront of healthcare.”<br>

Trade rises in Dubai’s free zones<br>
Dubai’s eight free zones recorded an 8.9 per cent increase in non-oil foreign 
trade during 2006 as compared to 2005, with the total value reaching AED193.6 
billion against AED177.8 billion in 2005, according to Dubai World. “Imports 
through the free zones increased by 12 per cent, from AED99 billion in 2005 to 
AED111 billion in 2006, whereas exports grew by only five per cent – from 
AED78.7 billion in 2005 to AED82.6 billion in 2006,” Adel Al Ashram, Senior 
Manager, Statistics Department, Dubai World, said. <br>
China topped the list of exporters to the free zones with goods worth AED18 
billion, followed by Japan with AED10.7 billion, the US (AED8 billion), Finland 
(AED6.8 billion) and Germany with AED6.4 billion. Iran, the top destination for 
goods from Dubai’s free zones, received goods worth AED9.4 billion, followed by 
Saudi Arabia (AED7.2 billion), Iraq (AED4.7 billion), India (AED4.5 billion) and 
Belgium (AED4.3 billion). The Jebel Ali Free Zone had the lion’s share of total 
non-oil foreign trade volume accounting for AED136 billion – AED79 billion in 
imports and AED57.6 billion in exports. The Dubai International Airport free 
zone was second with AED46.8 billion – AED25.8 billion in imports and AED21 
billion in exports. The Dubai Metals and Commodities Centre (DMCC) registered 
AED6.3 billion – AED3.6 billion imports and AED2.7 billion exports – followed by 
Dubai Cars and Automotive Zone (DUCAMZ) with AED2.9 billion – AED1.8 billion 
imports and AED1.1 billion exports.<br>
While Dubai Internet City recorded AED534 million with AED472 million imports 
and AED62 million exports, the Dubai Media City accounted for AED251 million in 
business. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Dubai Health City 
recorded imports worth AED23.5 million and AED21.6 million, respectively.<br>
String of IPOs likely<br>
Some large institutions, including Emirates Post, Showtime Arabia, Dubai Bank, 
DP World, etc, are said to be planning IPOs during the current year, according 
to a report. The Sharjah-based Air Arabia recently announced its plans for an 
IPO in order to finance its new fleet acquisition.<br>
Relatively undervalued market multiples, sustainability of double digit core 
operational earnings growth, stable and strong macroeconomic fundamentals, 
relative positive differential in earnings yield to the interest rate and a 
holistic bottom-up approach for investments across the markets, may help 
engineer a much-wanted recovery in the UAE stock market, the report said.<br>
The current market PE ratio of 13x is more realistic when compared to near 40x 
and 30x PEs witnessed during 2005 and 2006, respectively, which makes a 
compelling reason to take an active long-term exposure to the market during the 
current year, according to Dubai-based Daman Investments research report.<br>
Unsustainable high valuations, large liquidity drains, margin call pressure, 
limited foreign investor participation, increasing interest rates and an 
increasingly negative regional geopolitical sentiment had brought UAE’s National 
Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) Index down by 40 per cent during 2006 after the 
euphoric increase of 88 per cent and 101 per cent for 2004 and 2005, 
respectively.<br>
While a one-way rally may not be possible during 2007, a healthy return to 
equilibrium is the most desired outcome for the year, predicted Daman which 
launched its Daman Second Emirates Fund, an open-ended AED200-million fund which 
will focus on the UAE equities markets.<br>
The new fund’s minimum subscription amount was set at AED200,000. “We 
specifically wanted to structure a fund that would offer a very attractive 
opportunity to invest in UAE equities to a much broader audience,” said Daman 
Managing Director Shehab Gargash.<br>
The fund has already been seeded and has achieved a 6 per cent absolute growth 
during a period of approximately three months – over the same period when the 
NBAD index was down over 10 per cent.<br>
“This initial performance is a testament to our strategy which focuses on 
staying dynamic and creating an edge even in these unusual market conditions,” 
said Mr Gargash. He added that the investment threshold is significantly lower 
than the AED3 million minimum subscription required for Daman’s first 
UAE-focused fund – Daman UAE Value Fund. The previous fund provided investors 
273.84 per cent returns during its five-year tenure.<br>
Boosting business aviation<br>
Civil aviation authorities in the GCC region need to co-operate more to free up 
the region’s growing business aviation sector, according to His Highness Sheikh 
Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President, Dubai Department of Civil Aviation, and 
Chairman of the Emirates Group.<br>
“For the sector to further develop, particularly within the GCC, there needs to 
be greater co-operation among civil aviation authorities towards open skies 
policies, which will free up the market, increase competition, generate new 
opportunities and deliver greater economic success,” His Highness Sheikh Ahmed 
told the Middle East Business Aviation (MEBA) 2007 conference.<br>
The business aviation fleet currently stands at 300 as against 250 last year – 
and the sector is expected to double over the next five years, to account for 40 
per cent of the total Middle East aviation market, said Sheikh Ahmed. The 
current chartered flights market is estimated at approximately US$400 million, 
and would exceed US$700 million if private jets are added.<br>
Her Excellency Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, the UAE Minister of Economy, said: “Just 
as in a number of other industries, it’s the regulatory side of the equation 
that has not been able to keep pace with the technological innovation, which is 
why countries are still negotiating air service agreements, why landing rights 
are still an issue hindering industry growth, and why low-cost airlines are not 
yet serving every market.”<br>
According to the Middle East Business Aviation Association (MEBAA), business 
aviation activities are growing at a rate of approximately 11 per cent a year. 
MEBA 2007 was organised by Fairs &amp; Exhibitions (F&amp;E), the name behind the Dubai 
Airshow on behalf of MEBAA, and featured 90 exhibitors from 20 countries.<br>
Sales at the show totalled US$957 million, with Airbus generating US$580 million 
worth of business. The UAE’s Wallan Aviation received a US$75 million order for 
Cessna aircraft, a US$250 million deal for 20 Hawker 750 aircraft from Raytheon 
Aircraft Company and a US $52 million Bombardier confirmation for four Learjet 
60XR from Saudi-based businessman Ghassan Tabbah Shalabi as well as buyers from 
Kuwait and the UAE.<br>
Moreover, Emirates-CAE Flight Training (ECFT) signed an agreement for the 
Gulfstream 550 full-flight simulator and associated training equipment for the 
Business Jet Training Programme. The 31-member MEBAA estimates that the region’s 
current business aviation fleet generates revenues in excess of US$500 million 
annually across various industry segments such as aircraft charter, maintenance, 
Fixed Base Operations (FBO) and refurbishment.<br>

Rights of consumers and firms strengthened<br>
In February, authorities in Bahrain made two extraordinary decisions, in turn 
serving the needs of consumers and companies. In short, one law requires firms 
to post prices of products in the most visible way. The law applies to all 
retail outlets including small shops selling fruits and vegetables.<br>
The Ministry of Industry &amp; Commerce, which issued the ruling, argued that the 
law was made partly in response to growing inflationary pressures. It is 
believed that the order would help pacing a cap on prices by discouraging firms 
from setting prices above market rates. This is particularly the case with 
respect to products sold under government-guided prices such as fruits and 
vegetables. Consumers at large welcomed the ruling. Organistions supporting 
consumer rights viewed the order as a victory for consumer rights. Yet, the 
biggest challenge relates to implementing the new order. Certainly, it is one 
thing to issue a rule but totally another to implement it.<br>
Concurrently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued another ruling that 
proved popular with the business community. The order grants businesses the 
right to engage in sales or offering discounts on products without seeking prior 
knowledge of governmental departments or Bahrain Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry 
(BCCI). It seemed that the ministry issued the new rule if only to appease the 
business community after being asked to post prices in the other order. It is 
believed that the new rule helps the cause of competition amongst firms, 
eventually benefiting consumers.<br>
Meanwhile, commentators urged the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and BCCI to 
consider developing laws dealing with return policy. The idea deals with 
granting buyers the right to return products within a certain period. At the 
moment, some retail outlets of international chains have their own independent 
policies regarding returns and exchanges. However, the demand stipulates that 
there should be a legislation handling the matter per se.<br>
Bahrain too casts doubts over GCC monetary union<br>
Bahrain has cast some doubts on the ability of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
countries in implementing the planned monetary union in 2010. In an extended 
interview with The McKinsey Quarterly published in January, Bahrain’s crown 
prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa argued that technical matters could 
delay launching of the single currency. To be sure, Bahrain’s crown prince was 
in no way questioning the political will of GCC leaders. However, he questioned 
about reaching consensus on convergence criteria, namely inflation, public debt 
and interest rates.<br>
Under the planned monetary union project and the ensuing launching of a single 
currency, member states are required to meet five criteria dealing with 
inflation, short-term interest rates, budget balance, and public debt plus 
foreign exchange reserves.<br>
With respect to inflation, the rate should not exceed the weighted average of 
the member countries plus 2 percentage points. Additionally, short-term interest 
rate should not be more than the average of the lowest three countries plus 2 
percentage points.<br>
However, budget deficit could not exceed 3 per cent of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) and yet public debt stock should not exceed 60 per cent of GDP. 
Lastly, foreign exchange reserves should cover at least 4 months of imports. 
Bahrain has difficulty meeting the reserves requirement. In 2005, the value of 
four months imports amounted to US$2.6 billion. Bahrain’s reserves amount to 
nearly $2.2 billion<br>
Thus far only Oman had opted not to join the planned monetary union citing 
economic reasons. Omani authorities have argued that the sultanate could not 
meet the criteria for fear of undermining economic development efforts. As a 
developing country, Oman feels the need to be free to invest in the economy 
(partly to create jobs for locals) rather being restricted on debt and budget 
deficit levels. It is believed that Bahrain shares Omani concerns. However, 
unlike Bahrain, Oman decided to announce its position clearly and firmly.<br>

Qatar-Exxon gas project dropped<br>
Qatar Petroleum (QP) and ExxonMobil have dropped their plan to build a 
gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar due to cost escalation. Instead, they will focus 
their attention to developing part of the country’s huge North gas field. <br>
Qatar’s Energy Minister Abdullah Al Attiyah said this did not mean that other 
projects in Qatar were under any threat. In fact, very soon ground would be 
broken for a multi-billion-dollar GTL plant with Royal Dutch Shell. “GTL 
technology is expensive and very technical. Technology for the other projects is 
proven ... No other projects are under threat,” Al Attiyah said.<br>
Costs for the Exxon/QP GTL facility, which was to process gas into market-ready 
refined products, are said to have risen to as much as $18 billion from a 2003 
estimate of around $5 billion. The Exxon/QP GTL scheme, signed in 2004, had an 
initial budget of $7 billion. The plant was to have churned out 154,000 barrels 
per day.<br>
GTL plants process gas into clean oil products like low sulphur diesel, demand 
for which is growing on the back of tougher limits on emissions. QP has offered 
Exxon a role in the development of the Barzan gasfield, part of Qatar’s North 
field — the largest reservoir of non-associated gas in the world. QP also 
offered Exxon rights to participate in any future development at Barzan.<br>
Exxon’s Qatar country manager Alex Dodds said the Barzan cost would be similar 
to the company’s Al Khaleej gas project, also at the North Field. “We are 
pleased to have been the only international oil company selected to participate 
in the Barzan Project and look forward to continuing our successful partnership 
with Qatar Petroleum,” said Stuart McGill, senior vice-president of Exxon. <br>
A lot of gas projects in Qatar have inflated labour and raw material costs, 
aggravated by rising costs globally across an oil and gas industry, straining to 
bring new capacity online to meet rapidly rising demand for energy. ExxonMobil, 
the biggest foreign investor in Qatar’s energy sector, also has stakes in 
Qatar’s huge Rasgas and Qatargas liquefied natural gas projects. Qatar is home 
to the world’s third largest gas reserves after Russia and Iran.<br>
Qatar’s 2006 inflation at all-time high<br>
Qatar’s overall inflation touched an all-time high of 11.83 per cent in 2006, 
with the consumer price index (CPI) jumping to 133.23 from 119.23 in 2005. 
Soaring rent was the main driver of inflation, which for the first time hit a 
double-digit figure. The rate of inflation in 2005 was 8.8 per cent. Inflation 
stood at 0.2 per cent in 2002, 2.3 per cent in 2003 and 6.8 per cent in 2004. 
Data released by the Planning Council recently revealed the index weighting 
against the category that comprises rent rose 26 per cent in 2006. It stood at 
221.94 in December last year against 198.27 in 2005. <br>
The prices of garments and footwear rose considerably in 2006 as is evident from 
the sectoral index for the category. The index shot up to 114.46 in 2006 from 
101.81 the previous year. Another major jump was seen in the index relating to 
miscellaneous goods and services, in which personal luxury items and postal care 
services are included. Their index went up 13.6 per cent to 130.51 last year. 
The index weighting against the category of furniture, textiles and home 
appliances rose 3.9 per cent to 110.87 last year from 106.45 in 2005. The 
transport and communication expenses also climbed last year, as reflected in the 
index weighting against them. The index stood at 101.56 last year, up 1.9 per 
cent from 99.71 in 2005. The index on medical care and medical services stood at 
104.55 last year, up 1.2 per cent on 2005. The prices of most essential items 
have gone up in Qatar in the last several months primarily because of the impact 
of a rent spike on commercial and trading property. This has also led to a rise 
in the cost of services.<br>

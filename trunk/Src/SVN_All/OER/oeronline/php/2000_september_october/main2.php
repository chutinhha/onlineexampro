Since this time, the Centre has been a quality, one-stop information bank for potential investors and provides a vital link between local producers and international buyers.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    There have been a spate of recent reports in the local press suggesting that the investment laws are soon to be relaxed. The Development Council is planning to change laws to allow 100% foreign ownership in certain areas of the financial services sector by January 2003 and will increase the level of overseas investment allowed for domestic ventures with a capital of not less than RO150,000 to 70% in January 2001 rather than the current 49% level. OER talks exclusively to Mehdi bin Ali Juma'a, OCIPED's general manager of export development, and Malak Al Shaibani, OCIPED's director general of investment promotion, about the government's current investment laws in the Sultanate, the prospects for future export trade and the promotional activities conducted by OCIPED.<br>
                    <br>
                    "How does OCIPED promote inward investment?"<br>
                    "OCIPED promotes investment into the Sultanate by:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Providing support services for new business ventures in the Sultanate of Oman;<br>
                    2. Giving the right information and practical help for new investors;<br>
                    3. Coordinating with other agencies that promote investment inside and outside Oman;<br>
                    4. Promoting the Sultanate as an investment destination and an excellent strategic location for exportation in international exhibitions and road shows abroad;<br>
                    5. Designing plans to promote investment in industrial projects, tourism, the services sector and fisheries/<br>
                    agriculture; and<br>
                    6. Acting as an information bank that identifies investment opportunities in Oman."<br>
                    <br>
                    "What is the Sultanate doing to encourage foreign investment? What new incentives are there?"<br>
                    "Attracting foreign investment requires efforts in many areas. First and foremost is to have an investment friendly legal and regulatory environment and incentive packages. The next step required is to minimize the administrative barriers for investment. The final link in the chain is to have an effective investment promotion program. Investment promotion provides an important mechanism for communicating all the efforts to the potential investors and assisting the investors in implementing their projects.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The government, as part of World Trade Organisation entry, is at present reviewing the foreign capital investment law. The various aspects of this law, like the minimum investment capital, the maximum limit for foreign capital, taxation structure, land lease or ownership issues are at present being reviewed. At present Omani companies with foreign capital participation are eligible for customs duty exemptions and from payment of corporate tax. Land at nominal lease rates is also provided to them.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Regarding the administrative reforms, the roles of the recently formed Economic Development Council and the Businessmen's Council are significant. The Economic Development Council is empowered to look into all the economic matters and all bottlenecks that the country faces in the economic development process. The Economic Development Council is empowered to propose appropriate solutions to activate the national economic activities and remove all difficulties facing the private sector. The Businessmen's Council coordinates between the government and the private sector in a way that will develop the national economy in general and would promote commerce, industry, tourism and investment in particular. Further, recently when the Majlis Al Shura hosted a major symposium on streamlining administrative procedures, they provided an opportunity for the private sector to air its views on the procedures and for the government bodies to explain their views as well. The Forum reached a number of recommendations, which will be presented to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. The recommendations dealt with reforms, revising the laws, improving procedures, employing modern information technology to simplify and speed up the procedures. These measures indicate the importance given by the government to eliminate the administrative barriers on investment.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the major priorities for OCIPED is to promote Oman as a destination for investment.Effective promotion would have a positive influence on the investment decisions of international companies and we are doing our utmost to be an efficient agency and implement an effective strategy to convey the right message to our target audience."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "What are the current procedures for investing in Oman?"&nbsp;<br>
                    "The current procedures for investment in the Sultanate includes:&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Foreign investment is welcomed in the Sultanate if it is accompanied by technical expertise, and if it contributes to the development of the country through the transfer of technology;<br>
                    2. All international investment in Oman is governed by the Foreign Capital Investment Law (Royal Decree No.102 of 1994) which requires an application for a license to be filled with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry;<br>
                    3. The Foreign Capital Investment Committee has the authority to approve projects up to 49% foreign equity. However, the Minister of Commerce and Industry can intervene and increase the percentage of foreign ownership may be increased up to 65% if this action is deemed appropriate;<br>
                    4. Even 100% foreign ownership is allowed for certain projects which contribute to the development of the national economy upon approval from the Council of Ministers, provided the project's capital is not less than RO500,000 ($US1.3 million);<br>
                    5. The procedures are simple and well defined. However depending on the type of project the promoters may have to obtain approvals from other ministries; and<br>
                    6. At present these procedures are being simplified and government is in process of establishing a one-stop shop."<br>
                    <br>
                    "What latest significant changes have taken place in commercial law to promote investment?"<br>
                    "Recently, a ministerial decree 22/2000 has been issued to allow representative offices to be based in the Sultanate. This would encourage many international companies to study the market and business climate in the Sultanate and the Gulf as a whole and collect necessary data for future planned projects. The government is at present revising the company law."<br>
                    <br>
                    "What is Oman's current investment climate like?"<br>
                    "The main challenges facing Oman as with every other country in the world is the globalisation of the world economy. The technological revolution particularly in the area of telecommunications and information technology is generating a whole series of opportunities and threats for Oman and its business. All concerned with the future of Omans economy, both private sector and government have to work together to ensure that we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities. It is vital to the future of Oman's economy that it diversifies into new market areas and new sectors of economic activity. The globalization and the increased use of technology in telecommunication, Internet and satellite broadcasting, means that a host of new economic opportunities, which require new skill sets, is emerging throughout the world. Oman with its young and well-educated population can and should take advantage of this. In the present scenario, we are not confined to national geographical market. The excellent geographical location, establishment of Salalah port and the flexible and customized training package offer international investors excellent opportunity to establish knowledge based industry or other economic activates in Oman."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "How will joining the WTO have a positive impact on boosting investment from overseas and assist industries in Oman?"<br>
                    "The multilateral framework of the WTO in terms of the diversity of member nations creates additional market access opportunities for all countries including the Sultanate of Oman. But the realisation of successful investment depends upon the measures taken by individual countries to strengthen the efficiency and competitiveness of its economy. The Sultanate of Oman is in a good position to do well because of its own autonomous liberalization policies. Oman could exploit additional market opportunities in terms of specific products, however incremental such exports may be, as per Oman's Vision 2020 policy.<br>
                    <br>
                    For a large majority of industrial products, the bound rates of duty are higher than the currently applied rates. This allows Oman to have the freedom to give protection to existing or future industries in Oman if necessary. In a few cases where the bound rates are equal to or lower than the currently applied rates, Oman has succeeded in negotiating a transitional period of at least five years which will give domestic industries a reasonable time period during which to get prepared for competing with imported products.<br>
                    <br>
                    Low duties on chemicals will also be beneficial to Oman. Considering that Oman has a comparative advantage in petrochemicals, there is no need for high duty protection in this sector. In addition, Oman's potential exports of petrochemicals will have easy access to developed countries markets who have reduced their tariffs to very low levels.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Although Oman is a net importer of services, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) regime provides it with a good opportunity to upgrade and modernize its service sector, which in turn will have a positive impact on Oman's manufacturing base. Hence, foreign investments in these areas could be attracted.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    On the basis of the above analysis, it is fair to say that Oman has nothing to lose and potentially much to gain by joining the World Trade Organisation."<br>
                    <br>
                    "What is the level of foreign investment allowed for in large private sector projects? Why is there a different foreign investment ratio for small-scale projects?"<br>
                    "As per the existing foreign capital investment law, 100% foreign ownership is permitted as long as the capital of the project is more than RO500,000 and the project is of economic importance to the country. In the case of other projects the minimum capital requirements is RO150,000.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The government is reviewing this law. The maximum permissible level of foreign investment for most of the sectors is likely to be raised. Further for certain specialized services even 100% foreign ownership could be allowed. The government is also looking into full foreign ownership for projects with certain minimum level of investment. Attraction of foreign investment is a key element in Oman's plans to develop its economy. Apart from providing capital, foreign investment also has a role in bringing in much needed modern technology, technical skills, management techniques and providing employment opportunities and access to the export market. In this context the policy of the government is to provide maximum flexibility for the high tech and other skilled activities, wherein higher level of foreign investment would be considered. This would have the benefit of bringing in much needed modern technology, technical skills and management techniques. The reason for maintaining lower level of foreign investment in the case of small projects is that the technical and managerial inputs required for these activities are available indigenously."<br>
                    <br>
                    OER: "How competitive are Oman's industries?"<br>
                    "It is the market that determines the competitiveness in industry. With globalisation, geographical distances do not seem to matter and boundaries seem to have disappeared in this global village. Factories in one part of the world churn out products that people thousands of kilometres away consume. Globalisation has picked up pace in recent years with speed due to technological change. The power of computers has increased even as their cost is fallen. This has made it possible to transmit large quantities of information over vast distances at cheaper cost. The competition between companies has intensified, driving them to find cheaper ways to make their products which in turn makes them look for new markets to increase their business. Omani industries have to take up this challenge and become competitive in view of excellent government mechanisms, which provide free economy, excellent infrastructure and hassle-free environment."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "What mega-projects are planned for Oman (hotels, new industrial projects etc)? What projects are planned for Oman's industrial estates?"<br>
                    "The following projects are currently planned and welcome international participation:-<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Al-Sawadi Project<br>
                    2. Gas Pipelines Projects in Sohar and Salalah<br>
                    3. Sohar Aluminium Smelter Project<br>
                    4. Sohar Petro Chemicals Project<br>
                    5. Fertilizer Project<br>
                    6. Salalah Port Terminals&nbsp;<br>
                    7. Sohar Port<br>
                    8. Sohar Refinery Project<br>
                    9. Salalah Power Project<br>
                    10. Sewerage Plant in the Private Sector<br>
                    11. Methanol Project<br>
                    12. Ferrochrome - Ferrosilicon Project"<br>
                    "What level of investor confidence is there at the moment in the local market?"<br>
                    "The international investor community has considerable confidence in the Sultanate of Oman as a good location for business. This is reflected in the consistently high ratings achieved by the Sultanate in international surveys of business leaders. The quality of the Omani Government's stewardship of the economy is similarly highly rated as measured by the specialized agencies who measure the performance of national economies and the economic management policies and programs implemented by governments."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "Considering the high level of oil prices, do you forecast investor sentiment improving?"<br>
                    "The level of oil prices primarily affects government income whereas investors often take a wider perspective on issues such as corporate performance and growth. Investor confidence in the Sultanate as a business location is strong as demonstrated by the level of interest and support in developing projects in the country. The next two to three years will see many of these projects being implemented providing tangible evidence of investors' commitment to Oman."<br>
                    <br>
                    "Should Oman dive deeper into the technology and tourism sectors?"<br>
                    "Oman is currently moving into both the tourism and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors with significant expansion of activity in them planned over the next two years. Al Sawadi provides a major opportunity for large scale integrated tourism development but opportunities exist throughout the Sultanate on a smaller scale. Salalah provides a different product opportunity from the north of the country and it is good to see the development and growth of events like the Khareef Festival as a means of capitalising on this potential. ICT will be the major sector of economic activity across the globe over the next 25 years as the full potential of the technology becomes apparent. It is important that the Sultanate and its people derive full benefit from this expansion and OCIPED is working with senior private and public decision makers to ensure that the opportunities for Oman are captured."<br>
                    <br>
                    "How will the government policies on privatization open doors to new investment opportunities?"&nbsp;<br>
                    "Privatisation in the Sultanate is a relatively new process. It is not meant to sell unprofitable state-owned projects and diminish subsidies borne by the government, as is sometimes the case in other nation states. Moreover, privatisation is not an end in itself but is a means to achieve social and economic objectives. The policies and measures set for privatisation in the Sultanate consists of the selling of assets in stages that will suit the financial ability of the private sector. Privatisation is seen as a tool to provide opportunity to the private sector to participate in the establishment, operation and financing of the service projects. Moreover privatisation also provides suitable means to enable maximum number of people to hold shares. Participation by foreign companies in privatisation projects is encouraged as it provides a platform for technology and managerial expertise to be shared. The privatisation planned within the service sector will accelerate economic growth as well as ancillary development in Oman."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "Is investment in human resources and development in training on track in the Middle East particularly for Oman's growing young workforce?"<br>
                    "The Sultanate's human resource base, particularly the substantial numbers of young people, provides an excellent platform for the development of new economic sectors such as ICT. It is important that education and training systems meet the business needs of these sectors but the Sultanate is fortunate in having a good educational and training infrastructure in place to address these needs in an effective market sensitive way. All of us have to recognise that with the pace of global change, education and training will be a continuing part of our working lives as we respond to new job opportunities in growth sectors of the economy."</font></p>

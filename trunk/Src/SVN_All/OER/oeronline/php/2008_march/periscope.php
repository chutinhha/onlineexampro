</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Buying on dips</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>In an age of recession, some of the Southeast Asian markets offer excellent 
opportunities, defensive and yet with good earnings potential<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="periscope1.jpg" width="122" height="193" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The GCC stock markets have not been immune to Wall Street’s credit bubble, 
distress in international money centre banks and the risk aversion spike in 
emerging markets. Even though oil prices barely fell below US$90 even on talks 
of a US recession, it is significant that all GCC markets, including Saudi 
Arabia (supposedly closed to offshore fund managers), fell in unison. Some high 
beta shares in the GCC saw dramatic 35 per cent falls in a month, including the 
Dubai stock exchange operator DFM and the Saudi petrochemical blue chip SABIC. 
Yet, in a broader context, the GCC market valuations are nowhere near the peak 
valuations during the 2005-2006 bubble era. Moreover, GCC states have some of 
the highest current account surpluses to GDP ratios in the world and are not 
dependent on international liquidity alone. Kuwait, Bahrain and the UAE all 
trade at 13-14 times earnings yet offer corporate profit growth that can prove 
as high as 30 per cent in 2008. <br>
<br>
So while global panics will lead to an exodus of foreign money and a fall in the 
GCC indices, a “buy on dips” strategy will be merited by the excellent 
macroeconomic valuations, negative regional real interest rates, ample liquidity 
in the region and the creation of new long-term institutional investors, such as 
pension funds and bank mutual funds. However, economic recession can still mean 
a US$20-30 fall in oil prices, which would be traumatic for the regional share 
and property markets. So, even on dips, I would buy electricity firms, telecoms, 
food and pharma stocks, all traditionally defensive sectors, as compared to 
vulnerable sectors like banks, brokers, mortgage financiers, cement producers 
and contracting companies, which are most exposed to a fall in black gold and 
property prices.<br>
<br>
<b>Bullish anchors</b><br>
Hong Kong property faces exceptional secular bullish anchors: Real GDP growth of 
6 per cent, 10-year lows in unemployment rates and mortgage rates below the 
inflation rate. Since the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the greenback, the money 
market HIBOR has sunk to new lows as the Fed slashes rates in response to the 
Wall Street credit crunch. Moreover, since Hong Kong commercial and residential 
property yields are higher than the local 10-year bond yields, the market is not 
at all overpriced. Rising inflation, lower money market rates, supply/demand 
imbalance, a rise in rental prices with evidence of yield compression, housing 
affordability still at reasonable levels, a shortage of luxury apartments, and a 
vibrant secondary market all make Hong Kong property one of the most attractive 
asset classes in Asia. The beneficiaries of these macro trends includes Kerry 
Properties, which has the largest exposure to the luxury segment (30 per cent 
NAV), has developed commercial property in China and has a landbank in Hong Kong 
island. A midcap property developer that trades at an unjustified 50 per cent 
discount to NAV is Kowloon Development or CSI, whose business model upgrades 
commercial buildings in Shanghai and Hong Kong for resale to unlock value.<br>
<br>
A contrarian emerging markets call that I happen to agree with is to buy Thai 
equities. Thailand has been an investment disaster since 2006, when a military 
coup détat overthrew Prime Minister Thaksin and banned his Thai Rak Thai Party. 
Yet Thaksin’s allies, who regrouped as the populist PPP, won the recent Thai 
election. The rumour in Bangkok is that the palace, the military high command 
and the PPP have come to an agreement that will allow Dr. Thaskin to return from 
exile in London and reconcile with the generals who overthrew the civilian 
government. Meanwhile, the Thai central bank will follow the Fed’s rate cuts and 
bank loan growth and consumer confidence has surged. At 12 times earnings, 
Bangkok is one of the cheapest markets in Southeast Asia, with major banks 
trading barely above book value. Thai banks could surge 30 per cent if Thaskin 
and the generals reach a historic political compromise.<br>
<br>
<b>Safe havens</b><br>
It was only natural that Singapore’s Straits Times index lost 25 per cent of its 
value in the recent emerging markets sell-off. After all, with an export/GDP 
ratio that exceeds 200 per cent, Singapore is vulnerable to a US recession and 
plunge in global trade. Moreover, several Singapore blue chips are proxies for 
regional cyclical industries, such as petrochemicals, shipping, banking, oil and 
gas and semiconductors. <br>
<br>
The Straits Times index now competes with Mumbai’s Sensex and Hong Kong’s Hang 
Seng as the most volatile, high beta market in the Asian Pacific Rim. Yet, 
Singapore also offers some excellent defensive shares that can prove to be 
relative safe havens during times of emerging markets stress. These include the 
REIT’s or commercial banks. For instance, DBS, the largest bank in Southeast 
Asia, now trades at only 1.2 times book value, 10 times earnings and a dividend 
yield of 5.2 per cent. <br>
<br>
The Cambridge REIT, the fastest growing industrial and logistics real estate 
trust in Singapore, trades at NAV and offers a dividend yield of 10 per cent, 
almost triple the yield of the local government bond. The Philippines is also an 
attractive market after the correction, with Manila now trading at only 11 times 
earnings. A classic defensive share here is Manila Water, which is becoming a 
regional (Hong Kong, India, Vietnam, China) water resources blue chip. With 
earnings growth above 25 per cent and higher water tariffs, Manila Water is a 
defensive value share in Asian emerging markets haunted by the ghost of the 
grizzlies.<br>

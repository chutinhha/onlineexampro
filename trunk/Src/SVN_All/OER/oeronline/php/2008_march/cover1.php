challenges in Oman?</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
The challenges will continue. The demand for 
people with good talent, leadership qualities and market oriented is on the 
rise. Companies will have to develop human resources into good talent through 
education, training and the right exposure. Needless to say, recruitment and 
selection process will have to be more detailed and competency driven; this 
comes through training and experience. Not every manager is fit to conduct 
interviews just because he is a manager.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Do you think salary levels are competitive in 
Oman?<br>
</b>With the boom, salaries have witnessed an 
interesting surge. The scarcity of talent fuels this, coupled with lack of 
training that prevailed in the market earlier on adds to this. I have noticed an 
increased demand for training recently. One finds it hard now a days to find a 
spot in the busy training diary of good trainers. Now most companies understand 
that without trained workforce, they will have limitations and will not be able 
to achieve that they can achieve. From what I understand, feeder markets like 
India have also witnessed a massive increase in salaries which was kick-started 
by the multinationals. In GCC, salaries are also increasing. From our Dubai 
office, we find that some of the organizations are willing to pay any amount to 
get the right talent.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What innovative strategies companies are 
adopting to retain and attract talent?</b>Locally, I have seen retention becoming a 
repetitive item on strategic meeting agendas. I am not sure if enough is done in 
this regard. Increasing salaries is one tactic but more needs to be done.&nbsp; To be 
honest I am not sure if, at this stage, companies will be able to work out 
retention strategies so easily; it needs to be a culture that needs to be 
followed and nurtured in the companies. An interesting example that I have 
observed in one of the companies that are our clients, they encourage employment 
of retired staff’s children including daughters. Companies needed, earlier, to 
pay more attention to the retention of Omanis but now they need to do it in the 
case of expatriates also.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Which countries are emerging as the new feeder 
markets for attracting human resources?<br>
</b>Indian sub continent continues to be one of the 
main providers and we now see more number of South Africans in the market as 
well. </font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Do you think higher salaries are accompanied by 
increased deliverables?<br>
</b>Not always. </font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>In brief, how do companies find the right 
talent?<br>
</b>Companies are under pressure to show double digits 
growth, which means they have to continue to recruit. Companies are looking for 
younger age group employees. This makes the task harder. If companies spend more 
time at the selection stage (pain zone), they will have better chances of 
finding the right people.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What kind of role a company like yours is 
playing in meeting the HR challenge?<br>
</b>We offer recruitment, training and HR consultancy 
services. So far we have been doing a pretty good job for our clients but it is 
getting hard. We are trying to open new feeder markets for our clients. I think 
you need to ask our clients about our recruitment abilities. On training, we try 
to bring quality training through careful selection. The feedback we get from 
our trainees and their organizations is very encouraging. We are offering a wide 
range of training programmes and I encourage organizations to have a closer look 
at what we provide.</font></p>

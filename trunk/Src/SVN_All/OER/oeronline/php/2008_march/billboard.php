        Nando’s has yet again brought stars to life. This time it was Amy 
        Winehouse, the sensation of the 50th Grammy Awards held in February, 
        where she picked up a whopping five awards for best new artist, song of 
        the year, pop vocal album, female pop vocal performance and record of 
        the year. The diminutive British singer, known for bad behaviour and a 
        serious drug habit, is currently serving time in a rehab facility in the 
        UK to clean up her act.<br>
        <br>
        During her stay, she was given a “pass out” for a few hours on February 
        4. Reports from the British Daily Mail report the star as having looked 
        “the picture of health”, which is no surprise given that the star got to 
        feast on Nando’s. Winehouse. The star is a well-known fan of Nando’s 
        having mentioned the brand as one of the things she misses about the UK, 
        when touring and visiting the US. The ‘addiction’ to Nando’s shouldn’t 
        come as a surprise, considering it is well documented that Peri-Peri is 
        believed to be a rather addictive ingredient (thanks to the capsicum 
        rumoured to pump endorphins through the body). Nando’s in Oman is 
        located at the CCC, Qurum.<br>

        With the onset of summer around the corner, the Panasonic division of 
        OMASCO held a timely technical seminar on February 19 at the Mumtaz 
        Mahal. About 75 participants, including members of the ROP and MOD from 
        Muscat, Sur, Sohar and Nizwa were given a six-hour training and 
        demonstration by experts from Panasonic Dubai and technicians at the 
        Malaysian AC factory. Said Michael E. Hansen, Managing Director, OMASCO, 
        “The technical seminar was another step in our endeavour to share 
        knowledge and know-how with technical personnel across Oman to enable 
        greater effectiveness and efficiency. The fantastic turnout and active 
        participation was a very enriching experience for everyone involved.”<br>

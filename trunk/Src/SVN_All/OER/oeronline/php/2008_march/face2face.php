</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Giles Cunningham, the new CEO of The Zubair Corporation, has been in the banking 
and investment industry throughout his career. The mathematics graduate is an 
Associate of the Chartered Institute of Bankers and an active Harvard Business 
School alumnus. He began his career with the investment bank Kleinwort Benson 
before moving to Lloyds TSB Bank where he spent nearly 17 years. He held a 
number of senior positions at Lloyds that included the post of the Bank’s Middle 
East CEO for three years. “Giles’ contribution to Lloyds TSB Gulf region is 
incalculable. In three years, he has transformed our business and leaves an 
impressive legacy of success. As anyone who has worked with Giles will also tell 
you, he has always been a leader of great integrity, charm and warmth,” said 
Bert de Ruiter, Director at Lloyds TSB, on Giles departure from Dubai. Before 
moving to Zubair, Giles was the Director for Onshore Banking of Lloyds TSB 
International Banking in London. He was also responsible for strategy and change 
within the Division. Excerpts of Akshay Bhatnagar’s exclusive chat with him:</b><br>

<img border="0" src="face1.jpg" width="250" height="249" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">What made you shift from banking to the other side of the business?</b><br>
I have spent my entire career in the banking sector. As a banker, you rarely get 
the chance to “practice what you preach” and the opportunity of being on the 
other side of the desk was very tempting. From a personal development viewpoint, 
it is healthy to get out of your comfort zone regularly – its when you learn the 
most about yourself. Fortunately, The Zubair Corporation offered me this 
wonderful opportunity to do just that and I didn’t hesitate in taking up the 
challenge.<br>
<br>
<b>What is your impression about Oman as a country and as a market? </b><br>
The first thing that strikes you is the beauty of the country, and the 
friendliness of the people. It is interesting to see how they are moving ahead 
without losing touch with their culture and tradition. I’m looking forward to 
discover more about Omani society and really understanding the culture.<br>
<br>
On the economic front, Oman has transformed significantly. If I compare today’s 
Oman with what I saw during my first trip in 2004, the country has undergone a 
major change. One can easily see the increase in the pace at which the nation is 
galloping forward. For the business community, the opportunities to grow are 
immense. Those who have the vision and the drive to expand at a faster rate by 
being entrepreneurial and taking calculated risks are thriving. The Zubair 
Corporation is at the forefront of taking up new business opportunities in 
alignment with the group’s vision and strategy. <br>
<br>
<b>As you are a banking specialist, what is your assessment of Oman’s banking 
sector?</b><br>
The banks in Oman are doing well. The local banks are much stronger than ever 
before. There is however much to do before we could really compare with the most 
developed markets, for example in the areas of marketing, customer service and 
risk management. Even the international banks here in Oman still have work to 
do. But they are all making good progress. <br>
<br>
It is too early to talk about consolidation, but regional and international 
financial institutions have shown active interest in Oman. BankMuscat’s deal 
with Dubai Holding, Alliance Housing Bank becoming Ahli Bank, the beginning of 
Qatar National Bank’s operations and the Commercial Bank of Qatar acquiring a 
significant stake in NBO earlier, are all indicators of the sector’s strong 
fundamentals and growth potential. The UAE has been a much more obvious market 
for banking consolidation, and that has only just recently started to happen 
with the National Bank of Dubai and Emirates Bank getting together. Omani banks 
have considerable upside in organic growth at this stage.<br>
<br>
<b>What made you join The Zubair Corporation?</b><br>
There are very few companies that would have tempted me away from a successful 
banking career, but The Zubair Corporation is one of them. I look for a company 
that shares my values of high integrity and moral leadership, and the Zubair 
Group, led by H E Mohammed Al Zubair, has all of these strong values and more. 
Besides, I was also excited that the company was very open to change and wanted 
to move forward at a fast pace – this pushes all my buttons.<br>
<br>
The history of the business was another key element that attracted me to the 
Zubair Group - 40 years of business excellence being celebrated this year. It 
has emerged as one of the premier diversified business groups, not just in Oman 
but in the region as well, and made a significant contribution to the 
socio-economic development of this country. With businesses spanning 
automotives, construction, electrical, energy, home and business solutions, 
furnishing, investments, property, technology, travel and tourism, the Zubair 
Group is well poised to develop new business opportunities within Oman and 
outside. The international opportunities are something I am very keen to help 
the company exploit.<br>
<br>
<b>In your assignment as the ME CEO of Lloyds TSB at Dubai, you must have 
interacted with many business groups. How different is Zubair Group compared to 
them?</b><br>
There are many similarities. An inspirational founder at the heart of the 
business, and a strong family ethic, are often key characteristics. Zubair Group 
is as dynamic and progressive as any other fast-growing leading business group 
in Dubai. However, there is still much more we know we want to improve and 
change, so the future is very exciting. <br>
<br>
<b>With the group already doing so well, what will be your role and how easy or 
difficult is the job going to be for you?</b><br>
We have an excellent track record of success over the last 40 years. My role is 
to ensure that we embark on a path that will make us proud after another 40 
years! I’ve got to make sure that the group steps up its growth to the next 
level. I’m in the process of understanding each of our business lines and 
thereafter develop strategies to further enhance their business potential. 
Besides targeting business growth in Oman, I’ll be also looking at leveraging 
our relationship with international partners and associates to identify and 
develop business opportunities in the overseas markets<br>
.<br>
Developing the most talented, skilled and motivated Omani workforce is my key 
challenge – this is the future of the company. We have always been proud of our 
Omanisation performance, but there is much more we want to do. We have many 
plans to make The Zubair Corporation the first choice for the best Omanis. Put 
simply, I want this to be the best place to work in Oman, and I will not rest 
until this has been achieved.<br>
<br>
We are asking ourselves searching questions to ensure that we are future-ready 
to serve the interests of our business partners, customers and employees in the 
long-term. It is not just a catchy slogan. The Zubair Corporation will be here 
for the people not just today, but long into the future. <br>
<br>
<b>Do you think that instead of focusing on diverse activities, Zubair 
Corporation needs to identify its core activities and concentrate on them?</b><br>
It is too early for me to answer the question at this stage as I’m in the 
process of understanding each of our businesses. As long as we are and continue 
to be in the leadership position in our line of business, I see nothing wrong in 
being broad-based. There are advantages of being diverse, but I am also aware 
that it can distract focus. At Zubair, we have a reputation to live up to. If we 
are not the leader in some markets, we must work towards getting there. <br>
<br>
I’m in the process of understanding each of our business lines and thereafter 
develop strategies to further enhance their business potential. Besides 
targeting business growth in Oman, I’ll be also looking at leveraging our 
relationship with international partners and associates.</font></p>

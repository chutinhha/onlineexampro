</font>
<img border="0" src="world_scan.jpg" width="288" height="163" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Terminal 5 at London’s Heathrow Airport, which will exclusively serve British 
Airways flights, will open on March 27. According to Paul Starrs, British 
Airways’ Commercial Manager for the Middle East, “Everyone at British Airways is 
very excited about Terminal 5, an investment worth 4.3 billion GBP. We wanted to 
make any journey via Heathrow smooth, simple and stress-free, so we made 
Terminal 5. It’s all about putting the passenger first.<br>
<br>
“We have speeded up the processes that make spending time at an airport a chore, 
so there is more time for relaxing, eating, shopping or working. That means less 
time spent checking in through the extensive check-in facilities, including 96 
self-service kiosks and 96 fast bag-drop desks. There will be extensive retail 
facilities on offer, with 144 stores and restaurants. We have got some of the 
best names in the business at Terminal 5, such as Gordon Ramsey’s Plane Food, 
which is his first airport restaurant, as well as retail outlets, ranging from 
Paul Smith, Tiffany’s, Prada, Mulberry, to the first-ever Harrods fashion 
concept store,” opined Starrs.<br>
<br>
“We have also taken the opportunity with Terminal 5 to radically overhaul our 
airport lounges, or ‘Galleries’ as they are now known. There are six lounges for 
our First and Club World customers: The Concorde Room, The First class lounge, 
three Club Lounges and an Arrivals Lounge, with a capacity to cater to 2,500 
passengers, making it the largest and possibly the most luxurious in the world. 
For the ultimate in pre-flight pampering, we have teamed up with Elemis, the 
leading skincare expert, to offer customers specially created spa treatments,” 
Starrs concluded.<br>

next 10 years’</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Oil companies, oil-producing countries and consumers need to act now to avoid 
the crisis that is coming within the next 10 years, feels John B. Hess, chairman 
and chief executive of Hess Corporation, a global integrated energy company. 
Speaking at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates’ annual energy conference 
in Houston, Hess predicted, “it is not only a matter of demand. It is not only a 
matter of supply…. We need to take steps on both fronts, and we need to start 
today”. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates the number of on-road cars will soar 
to 500 million in China and 600 million in India by 2050. “That’s 1.1 billion 
vehicles in two countries that three years ago had fewer than 20 million cars in 
total creating an overwhelming increase in the need for automotive fuel,” said 
Hess.<br>
<br>
According to him the surge in oil prices in recent years has failed to weaken 
world demand because consumer incomes have grown faster than energy 
expenditures. “Since 1980, discoveries have not replaced our annual global crude 
oil production. Discoveries are getting smaller and located in more difficult 
environments, such as the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West 
Africa, where companies are now drilling in depths of up to 7,000 ft and 
searching for targets that are in some cases more than 30,000 ft deep,” Hess 
said.<br>

Indian IT-ITES industry continues to boom </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<br>
The total revenue of India’s IT &amp; IT enabled services (ITES) industry is 
expected to be $47.8 billion this year up from $37.4 billion last year, 
according to India’s National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom). 
Software and services export continues to grow at around 30 per cent per annum 
and has reached $31.4 billion. The contribution of the IT-ITES industry to the 
country’s GDP grew to 5.4 per cent from 4.7 per cent of last year, thus 
providing employment to more than 1.6 million youth, it said. However, the US 
credit crisis and appreciating rupee are posing strong challenges to the Indian 
IT industry. The once darling of investors, Indian IT companies have lost their 
sheen in the stock market. While traditionally Indian IT bigwigs such as Infosys, 
Wipro and TCS have concentrated on the US and European market for their 
businesses, the multinationals, notably IBM, have made significant inroads in 
the domestic market. IBM today has one-fifth of its workforce in India, 
accounting for the largest employee base next only to the US. Not only has IBM 
increased headcount, but also received large multi-million dollar orders from 
domestic clients.<br>

out from Olympics</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Stephen Spielberg has withdrawn from his role as artistic adviser to the Beijing 
Olympics, explaining that his conscience over the Chinese Government’s 
involvement in the Darfur crisis prevented him from further participation. His 
move is a public relations blow to the Chinese government, which is under 
pressure to force the government of Sudan to resolve the crisis in Darfur. 
Spielberg’s worldwide profile could lead others involved in the Games to pull 
out and even lead sponsors to reconsider their roles in the event. As the 
biggest customer for Sudan’s oil, China has been the target of Darfur advocates 
for the better part of a year, much to the dismay of Chinese officials, who have 
complained that the Games were being politicised. <br>

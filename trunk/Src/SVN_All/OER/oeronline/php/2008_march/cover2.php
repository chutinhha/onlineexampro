<img border="0" src="cover4.jpg" width="150" height="182" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Aluminium is a new industry for Oman, therefore 
the experienced local people are relatively scarce. However, at the outset of 
this project we committed to hiring a large number of previously unskilled local 
people, providing them with extensive work-specific training that has given them 
unprecedented opportunities for the future. The skills these young Omanis have 
now acquired are comparable to those you would find anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
To date we have recruited around 900 people of the 
1000 we will need, including expatriates, and provided skilled training to many 
more through our joint Bechtel-Sohar Aluminium construction training programme. 
Our experienced expatriate staff provide mentoring and on-the-job training and I 
am confident that when the smelter starts up in mid 2008 our operators and 
multi-functional technicians will be well-equipped to operate our smelter.<br>
<br>
For our support and administration staff, most of 
whom have been with us for almost two years now, we have carefully chosen people 
who share our vision of creating a world-class facility in Sohar and who are 
committed to the high standards we expect from our company. Where experience has 
been lacking we have provided the necessary tools to allow our people to not 
only complete their work but also to excel.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Are you able to get the right talent since 
there is a shortage of talent or skilled people in the region? How has this 
talent-hunt impacted salary structures in the region?</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
For our operator or unskilled staff, we have had 
strong interest from the local region and consequently little trouble in 
recruitment. For the technician roles there is a significant shortage of skilled 
people in Oman. We have commenced to address this by commencing a technician 
training programme in the last few years in conjunction with other major 
companies in Oman and we train about 50 new college graduates each year at 
present.&nbsp; We see this continuing for the foreseeable future.<br>
<br>
In order to address the shortfall in the immediate 
future we have had to recruit expatriates but the number will reduce in time as 
the local trainees become qualified and experienced to take over these roles.<br>
<br>
We are finding considerable competition from other 
large projects in the region both in our industry and in the petrochemical 
industries for skilled and experienced labour and this has put considerable an 
upward pressure on remuneration.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>What criteria do you use to benchmark salaries? 
Is it able to keep pace with inflationary trends in the country?<br>
</b>We benchmark ourselves with other industries in 
Oman and in the Gulf generally. It is relatively easy to gain a good 
appreciation of the market when you are in the recruitment mode, as we have 
been, it will become more difficult when we have completed this phase. We also 
use a number of surveys to assist in our annual assessment of salary levels.</font></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Does this shortage mean a shift in traditional 
employee sourcing bases as well? From where do you source your workforce?<br>
</b>We have mainly sourced our local employees from 
the Batinah region, in line with our commitment to support the people and 
industry in the region that our smelter will call ‘home’.&nbsp; It is important to us 
that the Batinah community, and Sohar in particular, feels a sense of ownership 
of Sohar Aluminium and many families have at least one relative working for us 
in some capacity. We also have staff from other regions of Oman who are in the 
process of relocating to the region.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Do you think shortages will continue in 2008?<br>
</b>With the strong growth in our industry in the 
region we expect the shortages to become even more acute during 2008.<br>

with unparallel quality of service by our qualified and experienced workforce.”<br>

driver of the demand for real estate in the future, which expands foreign 
ownership rights formerly restricted to GCC nationals, to include non-GCC 
nationals as well. With the Government’s ambitious diversification plan in the 
industrial and tourism segment, James is confident that the industry will

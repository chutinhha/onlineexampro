Time to rejoice? No!<br>

<img border="0" src="viewpt.jpg" width="131" height="205" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">As the orange-stripped white cab steered into the filling bay at the Al Maha 
petrol pump on the Qurum-Ruwi thoroughfare, I lifted my eyes from the magazine I 
was glancing through to see the uniformed attendant zeroing the meter, allowing 
the now-refined ‘black gold’ to flow into the petrol tank. Minutes later, a few 
Rials were exchanged and the cab merged into the thick afternoon traffic.<br>
<br>
‘What’s the price of oil nowadays?’ I asked the elderly cab driver. “You need 4 
Rials to fill the tank.” Well, that makes it 120 Baisa (or 0.120 Rials) or, 
US$0.31 a litre in Muscat. A week ago, I had paid around Indian Rs 47–little 
above one US dollar–a litre for fuelling my car in the Indian capital of New 
Delhi. Luxurious lifestyle, no doubt. Back in office, I heard the news break 
that the global oil price had for the first time closed above the threshold of 
US$100 a barrel. Well, they were talking about futures contracts–more 
specifically, the April/May delivery price for some 100 odd traders who booked 
on February 20, 2008. Was it time for us in Oman to rejoice? No, I am not in a 
mood to celebrate, notwithstanding the fact that I live in a moderately oil-rich 
Gulf country. <br>
<b><br>
Scary Scenario</b><br>
Sounds stupid. Why should I be scared? The higher the oil price, the greater is 
the inflow of hard currency into the oil-rich countries. But, that is only one 
side, the suppliers’ side of the story. What about the end-users? You don’t have 
to be John Maynard Keynes or Alan Greenspan to claim that energy is the most 
vital ingredient for economic growth. Shut energy supply and the economy will 
grind to an unpalatable halt. Production stoppage. Fast depletion of 
inventories. Supply snags. Scarcity in the marketplace. Demand-supply mismatch. 
Rising prices. Inflation. Unemployment. Crime and violence. Depression. Call it 
whatever you want: stagflation, or deflation. Labels don’t matter. Ground 
reality does, because it hurts. Even world’s richest nations will baulk at the 
idea of buying oil at US$100 a barrel. <br>
<br>
<b>Infinite source? No</b><br>
Oil is not an infinite resource. Thankfully, the oil-rich Gulf states are 
strategising to reduce oil-dependency. You need something more than oil to live 
life. Kingsize or otherwise. What’s that something? A global manufacturing base? 
Yes. A global financial services centre? Yes. Saudi Arabia, the region’s richest 
state and the world’s leading oil producer, has embarked on a multi-billion 
dollar King Abdullah Economic City. The name says it all. The Kingdom of Bahrain 
is pushing hard to emerge as one of the world’s largest financial centres. 
Commendable, no doubt. Qatar is on a similar track, fuelled by its natural gas 
bounty. Nobody remembers Dubai as the fishing port it once was. It is slick and 
European or Western, in every sense of the term. <br>
<br>
Abu Dhabi is fast emerging as the country that is pumping money to find an 
alternate to oil! The less said about Kuwait money and their enterprise outside 
their own country through their sovereign wealth funds, the better. In a 
nutshell, the region is booming and its coffers are overflowing, forcing Kings 
and Sultans of this region to look for investible avenues to safeguard their 
future. Just for a second, hold back. Ask a few sensible questions. One: where 
will you invest? Definitely, outside your own country. Two: where or to whom 
will you sell what you produce through the diversification strategy? Definitely, 
outside your own country.<br>
<br>
<b>Economic Pitfalls</b><br>
<img border="0" src="viewpt1.jpg" width="196" height="175" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Now revisit their responses. If the economy in the potential investible 
countries is grinding to a halt, it is not for want of money. But it is the 
forced energy crisis – read $100 a barrel – that may cripple their economies. 
Fiscal remedial measures will be less effective because there again is a limit 
up to which these mandarins can tinker their financial systems. Also, where will 
one stand if their purchasing power is eroded? I mean, who will buy the oil-rich 
nations’ goods. There will be no markets. So, it is a vicious cycle. A higher 
oil price hurts all in the final analysis.<br>
<br>
Just one final denouement–what James Howard Kunstler wrote in The Long Emergency 
(the title refers to the decline in oil supplies); he visualises an America you 
and I can’t imagine: “As energy supplies decline, the complexity of human 
enterprise will also decline in all fields, and the most technologically complex 
systems will be the ones most subject to dysfunctions and collapse – including 
national and state governments. Complex systems based on far-flung resource 
supply chains and long-range transport will especially be vulnerable. Producing 
food will become a problem of supreme urgency. The US economy of the decades to 
come will centre on farming, not high-tech, or information or services, or 
tourism or finance. All other activities will be secondary to food production 
which will require much more human labour.” The BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and 
China) countries may well be the future economic stars or czars. But, today the 
US still matters the most. Imagine the US as an agrarian economy as Kunstler 
predicts it will become. Another Nostradamus! But the truth is I am getting 
nervous. What about you?&nbsp;<br>

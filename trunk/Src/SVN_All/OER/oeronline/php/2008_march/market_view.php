</font><font size="4"><b>MSM stays the course</b></font><font size="1"><br>
<b>The month ended February 15 was a tough period for most of the GCC bourses, 
which shed weight during the month<br>
</b><br>
The MSM30 index went into a consolidation phase–declining by 1 per cent–during 
the period January 16 to February 15 after five months of sustained upward 
movement. This was even though on January 22, the index recorded its 
biggest-ever one-day fall of 8.33 per cent, with the banking and insurance 
indices leading the crash, losing 3.5 per cent due to worries over recession in 
the US, which led to heavy selling across global markets. Bank Muscat and Gulf 
Investment Services led the decline in the banking and insurance sector index. 
The recovery from January 22’s lows was mainly because of active buying interest 
in the industry and services sector stocks. Industry index companies leading the 
recovery included Al Jazeera Steel Products (+7 per cent), Oman Cable Industry 
(+10 per cent) and Oman Cement (+5 per cent).<br>
<br>
In other corporate developments, Galfar Engineering declared that it had bagged 
RO86.9 million contract for A’Seeb coastal vacuum sewer networks and ancillary 
works from Oman Wastewater Services Company SAOC. The contract period is around 
39 months. In another major development, Bank Muscat announced its plans to 
acquire majority stake in Saudi Pak Commercial Bank in Pakistan in association 
with Sinthos Capital, International Finance Corporation, Washington, and Nomura 
International. Bank Muscat will have a 35 per cent stake in the bank while 
collectively the consortium will hold 68 per cent stake. The acquisition is 
awaiting approval from the State Bank of Pakistan. <br>
<br>
<b>GCC Market</b><br>
The month ended February 15 was a tough period for most GCC bourses, which shed 
weight during the month. However, the Kuwaiti and Bahraini bourses managed to 
close on a positive note, gaining 2.64 per cent and 1.02 per cent, respectively. 
The insurance index was the top gainer on both the bourses, which ended up 7.81 
per cent and 3.21 per cent, respectively. The Saudi market was the worst 
performer, with the general index there shedding 22.14 per cent. All the broader 
indices here were in the red, with the industrial index taking the lead and 
slumping 26.57 per cent during the month. <br>
<br>
The DFM was the next worst performer losing 8.84 per cent. The share prices of 
the area’s largest real estate company, Emaar Properties, dwindled on the back 
of lower net profit and after its Indian IPO was deferred, and it took the real 
estate index down by 20.25 per cent. The Doha market too occupied the list of 
the losers, with the general index here plummeting by 7.28 per cent. All broader 
indices here were in negative territory, with the insurance sector leading the 
convoy by losing 21.13 per cent. The Abu Dhabi bourse shrank 3.18 per cent, with 
the banking counters leading the loss-makers.<br>
<br>
<b>Research Highlights<br>
Shell Oman Marketing Company:</b> Shell Oman Marketing Company (Shell) reported 
another strong full year results, with 22 per cent increase in revenue and an 
operating margin expansion of 1.13 per cent YoY. Excluding one-time expenses 
(donation- RO250,000), EPS for the year stood at 113 Bz compared to 89 Bz in 
FY06. <br>
<br>
Growth in the economy and increasing capital expenditure favourably impacted the 
commercial and retail segments of the company. However, compared to the 
industry, Shell’s performance was below par and this was mainly attributable to 
fuel-pricing irregularities between Oman and the UAE. Shell, however, continued 
to experience strong growth in the retail segment, as was evident from its 
average higher throughput (ATP), which grew by 8 per cent in 2007 to 9.3 million 
litres per annum. The increasing economic activity on the back of strong oil 
prices fuelled growth in local consumption. Of the total Oil production, 
approximately 15 per cent of Oman oil production is consumed internally 
(approximately 4 billion litres). <br>
<br>
During the year, Shell opened four new retail outlets and two new outlets are in 
the process of completion. During the year, Shell’s total retail outlets 
numbered 126, with approximately 50 select stores (at petrol pumps). Retail 
still remains the highest revenue contributor for Shell. This is even though 
Shell’s market share has been eroding due to increasing competition and higher 
growth registered by competitors. However, Shell remains the market leader with 
50 per cent retail market share. As a whole, the oil marketing sector looks 
attractive due to robust economic conditions, and operationally Shell’s 
performance compared to its peers remains good. We expect Shell to benefit from 
the increasing capital spending on infrastructure and construction, over and 
above on the rising auto sales in Oman.<br>

<br>
<br>
Though competition is heating up in the industry threatening Shell’s market 
share, opportunity in the market is up for the grabs and Shell’s superior track 
record speaks for itself. We expect Shell to report 8 per cent YoY growth in 
revenue to RO268 million in FY08 on the back of strong growth in capital 
spending in the country and new retail outlets. We expect marginal increase in 
gross margins for FY08, leading to an EPS of RO0.132.</font><p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<br>
We maintain our ‘Buy’ rating on Shell. The stock price appreciated 15 per cent 
in FY07, with a 7 per cent dividend yield. Shell has been able to increase 
margins on the back of increasing volume. Currently, Shell stock is trading at a 
P/E of 13x to our FY08 EPS close to industry averages. With 7 per cent dividend 
yield and strong earnings growth, we believe Shell still provides a good 
long-term investment opportunity.<br>
<br>
<b>National Bank of Oman SAOG:</b> NBO reported a 46.6 per cent growth in net profits 
(provisional results, subject to CBO approval) for 2007 on the back of robust 
growth in non-interest income. This was also aided by good recoveries in the 
last quarter, and a lower operating expense as compared to previous years. Net 
interest income (YoY) grew over 11 per cent to touch RO39.1 million. Against 
this, on the income (non-interest income) side, the bank achieved 49.5 per cent 
growth YoY to RO26 million, a key component in 2007 to the bank’s growth in its 
bottomline. Commission and fees constituted about 63 per cent of the other 
income component and about 9 per cent was contributed by treasury and forex 
earnings. <br>
<br>
The bank’s operating expenses rose by about 21.6 per cent during the year, 
mainly driven by a 38 per cent rise in administration costs at RO8.6 million. 
However, due to its growing income stream, the cost-to-income ratio shows an 
improvement at 44 per cent as compared to 45 per cent in 2005. The 26 per cent 
growth in operating profits (RO36.4 million) also factors in the impressive 
performance achieved on the non-interest income component. Provision for loan 
losses was down sharply by 26 per cent while recoveries rose by about 33 per 
cent. In 2007 as well, the Bank maintained its focus on remedial accounts and 
its efforts were rewarded with recoveries exceeding RO21.8 million (RO12 million 
loaded in the last quarter). In fact, net recoveries of RO14 million also helped 
in a big way in boosting the bottom line (about 28 per cent of pre-tax profits). 
Despite severe competition from existing as well as new players, the bank posted 
good asset growth. For the full year 2007, the bank’s loan book grew by 29 per 
cent to RO907 million, with an addition of about RO203 million from December 
2006 levels.Deposits grew slower, up 15 per cent at RO936 million, though at a marginally 
higher cost.<br>
<br>
Given our assumptions of a 30 per cent growth in loan assets in 2008, we expect 
the NBO to generate an EPS of RO0.584 and BV per share of RO3.142. Current 
valuations discount the EPS estimate by 13.9 times and BVPS estimate by 2..6 
times. Though competition remains a concern, we think the softening rates 
scenario should benefit the banking sector at large.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

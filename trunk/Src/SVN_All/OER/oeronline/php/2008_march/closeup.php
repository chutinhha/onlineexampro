Confronting inflation in Qatar</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="close.jpg" width="137" height="234" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Authorities in Qatar are having a daunting task containing inflation. Worse 
still, prospects for bringing inflationary pressures under control are not 
promising. Extraordinary economic growth is chiefly responsible for the 
inflationary pressures in the country. According to the General Secretariat for 
Development Planning, a governmental agency, inflation rate in Qatar stood at 
13.74 per cent by December 2007-end, with the general index up at 159 points 
compared with 140 points in the year-ago period. More specifically, rents and 
utility costs increased by 27.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus 
28.8 per cent in the previous three months. Also, food, beverage and tobacco 
costs rose by 10.5 per cent in the last quarter of 2007 up from 6.59 per cent 
the previous quarter. <br>
Much to their credit, official statistics are in line with independent figures. 
For instance, the US investment bank, Merrill Lynch, puts the inflation rate in 
Qatar at 14 per cent in 2007. Nevertheless, existing inflationary pressures in 
Qatar are a far cry from the past few years. According to the Economist 
Intelligence Unit (EIU), the rate averaged 2.6 per cent in the period 2002-2004.<br>
<br>
<b>Worst rate</b><br>
To be sure, Qatar’s inflation rate is the worst within the Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC). But, while it is believed that official figures more or less 
capture inflation in the Qatari economy, the same is not necessarily true of all 
other GCC member states. Merrill Lynch expects an inflation rate of 12 per cent 
in the UAE this year. The other GCC countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and 
Bahrain are also suffering from inflationary pressures, but are better off as 
compared to the UAE and certainly Qatar. Several reasons stand behind growing 
inflationary pressures in Qatar, notably local economic expansion. The EIU 
calculated the country’s real, adjusted for inflation, GDP (gross domestic 
product) growth rate at 7.8 per cent in 2007. Again, it expects the GDP to grow 
by 9.3 per cent in 2008 and still further by 12.4 per cent the next year with 
expansion of the country’s gas sector. Furthermore, firmer oil prices and 
declining interest rates translate into stronger availability of liquidity, in 
turn adding to inflationary pressures. The Qatari riyal is pegged to the US 
dollar, a policy that dictates importing interest rates from the US.<br>
<br>
<b>Rental cap</b><br>
In 2006, the government placed a 10 per cent cap on annual rise of rental rates 
as part of its efforts to check runaway prices. However, thanks to steady demand 
on the back of strong economic growth, attaining the objective did not seem 
possible from the very onset. A report by the EIU suggests that the policy 
failed partly because growth in supply could not keep pace with demand. Needless 
to say, some property owners managed to find different means to counter the 
restrictions, including charging additional prices for new services, such as 
increasing security measures in residential compounds. Visiting Qatar in 
January, one noted that inflation topped the agenda when talking to expatriates. 
The issue was not the same with regard to the locals, as the government kept on 
raising salaries for public sector employees, where the majority of Qatari 
nationals (more than 90 per cent) work. Last year, the authorities raised 
salaries of public sector employees by a hefty 40 per cent. Additionally, the 
authorities provide locals with subsidised rates for utility services. 
Undoubtedly, extending increasing salaries to foreign nationals is not possible 
for all firms operating in Qatar, specially small and medium sized entities. 
Expatriates make up the utmost majority of workers in the private sector. <br>
<br>
<b>Soaking up liquidity </b><br>
Certainly, correct information is vital for making decisions designed to counter 
inflationary pressures, something Qatari authorities are putting into use. 
According to Qatari Finance Minister, Yousuf Hussein Kamal, officials are 
contemplating issuing bonds in order to stem excess liquidity available in the 
market. The matter has become increasingly necessary due to declining interest 
rates. Qatar has been following moves by the US Fed in cutting interest rates 
due to the pegging of the riyal against the dollar. The Fed has reduced interest 
rates several times in the last six months. Low or lower interest rates plus the 
decline in the stock markets translate into additional liquidity, which only 
fuels inflationary pressures, as it provides further incentives to buy.<br>
<br>
Other steps call for building cheaper homes and controlling costs of building 
materials as well as placing restrictions on prices. Yet, the policy of imposing 
price controls can backfire. The EIU has warned that the suggested policy could 
backfire, as it can turn out to be a disincentive to retailers to stock 
supplies. In turn, the shortage of materials will add to inflationary pressures. 
Still, other measures to fight inflationary pressures include strengthening cap 
on rental rises. One such proposal calls for lowering rental increases that 
landlords can charge from 10 per cent to 7 per cent per annum. Aided with 
transparent statistics, the Qatari authorities keep coming up with ideas to help 
fighting inflation. <br>
<br>
<b>Hard choices</b><br>
Trouble is the authorities do not control key variables causing inflationary 
pressures. For instance, Qatar has no choice but to follow the US Fed with 
respect to interest rates, so long as the Riyal is pegged to the Dollar. 
Certainly, the Qatari government can elect to end the link, as this is a 
sovereign decision. Else, Qatar could follow Kuwait by adopting a basket of 
currencies that includes the dollar plus other major currencies, notably the 
Euro and Yen. Kuwait made the move in May 2007, but judgement is not yet out. 
Merrill Lynch expects inflation rate in Qatar to reach 14.5 per cent in 2008, up 
from 14 per cent in 2007. Clearly, Qatar has no choice but to live with 
inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future. Economic growth comes with a 
price tag, Qatar being no exception. <br>

            <b>Pic-Tel GVP 2000 Videophone </b><br>
            The Pic-Tel Videophone delivers colour video footage through a 
            standard telephone line with variable display mode at exactly the

            phone, and works worldwide. Its pop-up screen features a video 
            display and miniature camera. You can even hook it up to a TV or a 
            video to record and play back calls. Moreover, you can decide 
            whether you want a video call or not by simply declining the video 
            request. The Videophone displays images at a rate of 15 frames per 
            second, and also features a surveillance function, which allows you 
            to dial in and connect to the video from another location. Check if 
            your home or office is secure while you're not there. As a bonus, 
            you get extras such as a built-in call directory, call log and alarm 
            call function.<br>

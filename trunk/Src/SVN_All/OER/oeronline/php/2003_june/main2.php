                  Despite bullish sentiments from many analysts, Shwan Taha of

            to consolidate to grow faster. Ujala Farooque reports</font></b><p>

            Investment (Turkey office) is adamant that Gulf countries could 
            attract further foreign investment if they cooperated better with 
            each other. He is in favour of creating a large GCC single market, 
            for equity as well as for currency.<br>
            The Omani Centre for Investment Promotion and Export Development (OCIPED), 
            in a report earlier this year, stated that, &quot;AGCC (Arab Gulf 
            Cooperation Council) countries have similar economic tendencies 
            (trade partners, exports, investment structure, resources etc.). 
            This parallel nature of AGCC nations, instead of being a constraint, 
            can be a source of strength if we deal with these economies as one 
            unit. The expansions of production-based free trade areas have many 
            advantages. They will create large-scale industrial establishments, 
            generate economies of scale, and lead AGCC countries to progress 
            towards world competition.&quot; <br>
            The setting up of the Arab Free Trade Area (AFTA) late last year was 
            an attempt to kick-start Arab economic integration although it is 
            too soon to comment on how successful this initiative has been. 
            Ahmed Goweili, secretary-general of the Arab Economic Unity Council, 
            pointed out at AFTA's inaugural address that the Arab Gross National 
            Product (GNP) accounts for US$700.3 billion (2.2 per cent) of the 
            world's GNP whereas Arab exports represented 3.8 per cent of the 
            global exports in 2000.<br>
            Taha says, &quot;Most of these countries restrict foreigners from 
            investing freely. There is no question that this cannot continue 
            forever. The countries that allow reasonably unrestricted 
            investments in the Gulf are limited.&quot;<br>
            &quot;The Middle East has too many constraints like market capitalisation. 
            Quite often, we will assess a company and decide that it's good to 
            invest in until we spot that it has a capital base of only US$100 
            million, which is too small for us to consider it further.&quot; <br>
            &quot;Oman is definitely on the right track. But the problem I see in the 
            region is the relatively small size of the market. Let's assume that 
            the Gulf had a single bourse and you had one stock market index - 
            this would do wonders for the region by making it much more visible. 
            At the moment, the Gulf's bourses are seemingly small satellite 
            markets that are too easy to miss by key global players.&quot;<br>
            &quot;We used to track a few Omani companies, but this interest has 
            waned. Remember, an Omani company would be competing for our money 
            with a Taiwanese or a Brazilian company. We need to have very good 
            reasons to invest in an Omani company and not a Mexican one with the 
            same valuations. At the end of the day, you can't look at them all.&quot;<br>
            But many more investment houses have developed in the Gulf in the 
            past decade. The fixed income and bond markets were virtually 
            unknown six years ago; now there is a healthy fixed income market. 
            Also, you have a thriving local stock market in Oman and there is 
            more attention to matters of transparency and corporate 
            responsibilities. The challenge, it seems, is to harness interest 
            and support from global investors. </font></p>

                          Oman: Investment paradise<br>
                          </b>Oman's strategic location, in close proximity to 
                          GCC states, gives it an opportunity to serve a 
                          consumer market of 26 million people, in addition to 
                          Iran and Yemen which together host nearly 73 million 
                          consumers. The country has already put the necessary 
                          infrastructure in place right from modern airports and 
                          seaports to excellent telecommunications. Recent 
                          privatisation programmes have increased investment 
                          opportunities and, at the same time, legislation 
                          regarding investment is being made flexible to 
                          accommodate more foreign investment. Political 
                          stability and establishment of good relations with the 
                          neighbouring states is on the rise and efforts are 
                          being made to improve economic ties within and outside 
                          the region.<br>
                          There are extremely investor-friendly regulations in 
                          the Sultanate such as the Foreign Capital Investment 
                          Law that allows investors up to 100 per cent ownership 
                          in a project with minimum capital of RO500,000. 
                          Government-granted loans through Oman Development Bank 
                          (ODB) allow for an attractively low interest rate of 
                          three per cent for projects with an investment 
                          exceeding RO 50,000. No income tax is levied and there 
                          is no Customs duty on plant, machinery and spare parts 
                          imported for industrial investment purposes as well as 
                          on raw and semi-processed material imported for 
                          manufacturing purposes that are not available locally.</font></td>

            growing up. Richard Dean reports</b><br>
            <br>
            The phones have never been so hot at Global Investment House (GIH), 
            a boutique investment bank in Kuwait City. Ever since war in Iraq 
            ground to a halt, it has been bombarded with calls from analysts, 
            fund managers and financial journalists from across the world. They 
            all call with the same question: how can international investors get 
            a slice of the Kuwaiti bull market? <br>
            &quot;I've been here three years, and I've not seen this before,&quot; 
            exclaims Shailesh Dash, equity analyst at Global Investment House. 
            &quot;I've got a lot of calls from the US and Europe over the last six 
            weeks, since the war ended. They have seen that there is more 
            stability in this region. They don't know much about it, but they 
            have seen that these markets are rising and think &quot;I'd like to be 
            part of that'.&quot; <br>
            Who can blame them? By any standards, 2003 has been a vintage year 
            for GCC stock markets. Benchmark indices are soaring as local 
            investors have turned their attention towards local equities. 
            Trading volumes have risen sharply across the region; many of the 
            region's bourses now compare well with 'traditional' emerging 
            markets in Latin America, Eastern Europe and South East Asia.<br>
            All this at a time when international stalwarts such as the Dow 
            Jones and FTSE 100 are in the doldrums. After years of 
            underperformance, GCC markets today rank among a handful of world 
            stock exchanges that are bucking the global equity downturn.<br>
            A quick look at the figures paints a vivid picture. Dubai-based 
            investment bank Shuaa Capital produces a GCC index, charting the 
            combined progress of Gulf markets. This has surged by more than 11 
            per cent already this year. In Kuwait, the benchmark Kuwait Stock 
            Exchange (KSE) index has risen by a staggering 45 per cent since 
            January. <br>
            Other key indicators hammer home the impressive trend. Analysts look 
            at ratios to judge the maturity of a stock market; a firm favourite 
            is market turnover/market capitalisation. Analysts at Shuaa Capital 
            calculated turnover for Arab markets from January to mid-May 2003 
            (The GCC represents some 85 per cent of total Arab market 
            capitalisation). Annualising those figures, they forecast turnover 
            this year will be US$143 billion (RO55 billion), on market 
            capitalisation of US$215 billion (RO82.69 billion). <br>
            &quot;That's a turnover ratio of 67 per cent; that's good by any 
            standards,&quot; says Shuaa Capital analyst Walid Shihabi. By almost any 
            barometer, then, local equity markets have produced stellar 
            performance in recent months. Indeed, the bull market stretches back 
            a couple of years. Most observers agree this is good news for the 
            local economy, but a number of questions remain. What has driven 
            markets ever higher? Is the current performance sustainable? And, 
            crucially, how will this new equity market culture help real GCC 
            companies to grow and develop, creating real jobs and prosperity?<br>
            The first question is the easiest to answer: a host of factors have 
            conspired in favour of local markets since 2000. These include high 
            oil prices; the poor performance of international markets; low 
            interest rates; and the repatriation of funds to the Arab World 
            post-September 11. For all these reasons, local markets have been 
            flush with liquidity.<br>
            &quot;Most of the positive indicators have to do with liquidity,&quot; says 
            Shuaa Capital's Shihabi. &quot;You have a combination of excess liquidity 
            when interest rates are rock bottom. In the Gulf, monetary policy 
            closely follows the US; so, interest rates are very low. Interest 
            rates on bank deposits are extremely low.&quot; Today, customers are 
            lucky to get 1 per cent on their local currency deposits.<br>
            In other words, Gulf investors have been left with a lot of excess 
            cash on their hands and nowhere to put it. Some has found its way 
            into the real estate market while Ôsafe haven' commodities such as 
            gold have also become popular. But the main beneficiaries have been 
            local equity markets. <br>
            Clearly, circumstance has played a major role. But Shihabi stresses 
            that the regional financial community deserves at least some credit 
            for the way it has put its house in order in recent years. Until 
            very recently, most Gulf equity markets were seen as 
            poorly-regulated, lacking transparency and subject to illicit 
            practices such as insider trading. &quot;Investors have burned their 
            fingers, especially in Oman, Kuwait and the UAE.&quot; <br>
            Today, that is changing. Markets are increasingly well regulated, 
            forcing companies to be far more transparent and open. In the UAE, 
            governments launched formal stock exchanges in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, 
            phasing out the old over-the-counter system. &quot;I remember, four years 
            ago, it was difficult getting financials out of listed companies in 
            the UAE,&quot; says Shihabi. &quot;Today, we get quarterly results from around 
            half the listed companies.&quot;<br>
            Elsewhere in the region, governments have taken serious steps to 
            tighten practices on existing bourses. In Oman, the Capital Markets 
            Authority and Central Bank have won praise for the way they have 
            forced companies - particularly banks - to be more honest and open 
            about their accounts. <br>
            &quot;Transparency has played a major role,&quot; says Lo'ai Bataineh, head of 
            investment management at Oman Arab Bank. &quot;The CMA has made a lot of 
            changes. Today, banks are being open about their difficulties. Five 
            years ago, they would never have said this. The Central Bank is now 
            being very tight.&quot; Contrast this with mature markets, which have 
            been rocked by accounting scandals such as Enron and WorldCom. 
            Investors have lost their blind faith in the integrity of Western 
            companies, just as Gulf firms are taking great leaps forward. It's a 
            potent combination. <br>
            So much for the past. What does the future hold? Can local markets 
            sustain their recent gains? The jury is still out. <br>
            On the positive side, recent rises have been fuelled by fundamental 
            factors. As well as low interest rates and high liquidity, local 
            corporate profits have been strong. Three years of high oil prices 
            have supported high government spending - the engine that drives the 
            Gulf economy. As such, corporate dividend yields have been high, 
            between four and five per cent. Compare that with bank deposit 
            rates, and it is easy to see why local equities have proved popular. 
            First quarter results from 2003 suggest this year will be another 
            profitable one for Gulf companies.<br>
            Price/earnings (P/E) ratios - a key guide to whether a company's 
            shares are fairly valued - are between 15 and 20 in Gulf markets 
            (the lower the number, the better the value). That's high by 
            historic local standards, but far from outrageous by international 
            benchmarks. The S&amp;P 500 in the US is currently trading at a P/E 
            ratio of around 32, despite sharp falls in US share prices since 
            2000. <br>
            Furthermore, the growing maturity of the Gulf's financial sector 
            will support stability. Five years ago, accurate and reliable 
            research on Gulf companies and markets was hard to come by. Today, a 
            growing band of investment banks and brokerage houses produce 
            well-researched analysis on local equities. The emergence of the 
            likes of Shuaa Capital in the UAE, GIH in Kuwait, Securities and 
            Investment Company in Bahrain and Bakheet Financial Advisors in 
            Saudi Arabia means that investors are informed like never before.<br>
            Clearly, good research plays a significant role in encouraging the 
            flow of funds. But the role of local investment banks extends beyond 
            producing investment analysis. In the primary market, investment 
            banks encourage and facilitate the process of listing through an 
            Initial Public Offering (IPO). And in the secondary market, their 
            trading makes markets more efficient. &quot;They create a secondary 
            market,&quot; explains Shihabi. &quot;They channel funds into good firms and 
            out of weaker companies. That makes the market more efficient.&quot; <br>
            Sadly, these positive factors do not make the current Gulf bull 
            market risk free. Far from it. Analysts warn of worrying signs of a 
            bubble emerging, particularly in Kuwait. <br>
            &quot;Market capitalisation in Kuwait is higher than GDP, but there are a 
            lot of cross-holdings within the corporates,&quot; explains GIH's Dash. 
            &quot;The real market capitalisation will be much lower.&quot; In other words, 
            companies are buying each other's shares, a process that inflates 
            share prices and profits in the short term, but can have devastating 
            consequences if share prices collapse. <br>
            Shuaa Capital's Shihabi echoes fears about the Kuwaiti market. 
            &quot;There is a highly liquid bubble. There are fears about that in 
            Kuwait. Profits from the market are feeding profitability. The 
            market is feeding itself, and that is not sustainable.&quot; <br>
            At present, the market is being sustained by a combination of high 
            oil prices, low interest rates and poorly performing international 
            markets. But the broad consensus among international economists is 
            that, over the next 12-18 months, oil prices will fall, interest 
            rates will rise and international markets will bounce back. If this 
            happens, markets such as the KSE could fall as spectacularly as they 
            have risen.<br>
            But that is pure speculation. Looking on the bright side, Gulf 
            markets are doing well: fundamentals are strong and valuations 
            appear fair. Which raises the final question. Why does this really 
            matter? Stock market speculators may be making money as the market 
            rises, but how does this affect the real economy, with real 
            companies generating real jobs? <br>
            The short answer is that it matters a great deal. &quot;It is companies 
            funding their own growth,&quot; says Shihabi. &quot;It is local money going 
            into productive channels.&quot; The primary market is where real value is 
            added to economic and corporate life. Financial markets exist as a 
            financial intermediary: that is, it is a way for people with spare 
            cash to invest in companies and entrepreneurs with good ideas but no 
            capital. The stock market brings them together, allowing companies 
            to grow and thrive, creating jobs and wealth.<br>
            This takes place in the primary market, through companies 'going 
            public' via an IPO, or through rights issues (when existing listed 
            companies sell additional shares in themselves). Crucially, there is 
            a link between the primary and the secondary market. A buoyant 
            secondary market signifies that investors have excess liquidity, and 
            that they want to invest in local companies. This encourages more 
            companies to expand and invest. <br>
            This is exactly what is happening in Kuwait. &quot;Now there is a lot of 
            activity; we are seeing a lot of IPOs,&quot; says GIH's Dash. &quot;Eighteen 
            months ago, there were 85 listed companies in Kuwait. Today, there 
            are 97, and we will pass through the 100 barrier before the end of 
            this year.&quot; GIH was due to list on the KSE in late May.<br>
            &quot;This is good news for the local economy,&quot; says Dash. &quot;It is helping 
            the development of the private sector in Kuwait; there are a lot of 
            projects that will benefit. There has never been a lack of capital 
            in Kuwait. Now, Kuwaiti companies can depend upon the local markets 
            to raise funds.&quot; <br>
            Clearly, equity is not the only way companies can raise funding; 
            many rely quite comfortably on bank borrowing. The competing values 
            of the two (debt vs equity) has been argued over by academic 
            economists for 50 years - some have won Nobel Prizes for their work. 
            It is a complex argument, and the pros and cons for each company are 
            different. <br>
            The Gulf must have a financial sector that offers all the options. 
            &quot;A sophisticated and deep financial sector contributes to economic 
            development,&quot; says Jean-Louis Sarbib, vice president of The World 
            Bank for the Middle East and North Africa. This must include banks, 
            insurance companies, leasing companies, equity markets and mortgage 
            markets.<br>
            For all these reasons, then, it is clear that the GCC desperately 
            needs a thriving equity market culture. For decades, the Gulf has 
            been an exporter of capital. But today, the region's buoyant equity 
            markets are beginning to reverse that trend. Says Shuaa Capital's 
            Shihabi: &quot;Are we still and exporter of capital? Yes. But the ratio 
            has changed: more is being retained in the region, and is being 
            channelled towards productive investments.&quot;</font></p>

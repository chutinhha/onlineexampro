            Thomas, general manager, (automotive sales division), MHD, speaks to

            Soon after graduation, I joined the government services in India and 
            worked there for nine years. However, since there was hardly any 
            scope for a rapid career rise, which did not suit my ambitious 
            plans, I started exploring opportunities in the private sector. In 
            1972, I received an offer from Mohsin Haider Darwish (MHD) and came 
            down to Oman; ever since, I've stayed with the company. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Early days at MHD <br>
            </b>As with all automobile distributors, we had no showroom or 
            displays in the early 1970s, and we operated from a small office in 
            Muscat. Landrover was our only franchise then. We also had limited 
            staff, and I handled all aspects of the operations.<br>
            In mid-1970s, MHD became the first automobile distributor to set up 
            a showroom in Ruwi, and it generated a great deal of excitement The 
            prices of oil started shooting up around this time, triggering a 
            rapid all-round growth. Consequently, the automotive industry 
            registered exponential growth and we started importing Jaguar and 
            Rover during this period. It was a very exciting phase. <br>
            The promoters decided to capitalise on emerging opportunities and, 
            so, MHD went through a structuring process and various divisions 
            were set up. I was asked to head the automotive sales, which was 
            hitherto handled by the promoters themselves. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Management Philosophy <br>
            </b>Our promoter and managing director, Mohsin Haider Darwish, is a 
            visionary with a thirst for constant innovation attested by the fact 
            that MHD was the first private company in Oman to computerise its 
            systems in the mid-1970s. He believes in engaging his staff in 
            discussion, listening to them and implementing their ideas. Being a 
            customer-centric organisation, all of our operations are aimed at 
            giving the customer a totally satisfying experience. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Employee management<br>
            </b>Each employee is given specific targets and performance is 
            regularly evaluated and is directly linked to rewards and 
            incentives. As a forward thinking organisation, we want our staff to 
            be proactive and initiate processes. The team is encouraged to come 
            forward with suggestions and great value is attached to this 
            feedback.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Leadership style <br>
            </b>I begin my day at office with a meeting with my staff. I discuss 
            the day's agenda with them and delegate responsibilities and then 
            proceed with the rest of my work.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest achievement<br>
            </b>Running the operations successfully for over 30 years now has 
            given me a great sense of satisfaction. What started as a 
            one-franchise operation has now grown to seven franchises with 
            multiple products. This growth is very fulfilling. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest mistake <br>
            </b>On a day-to-day basis, there have been errors of judgement as is 
            bound to happen with anyone. However, there has been no major 
            mishap.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest strength <br>
            </b>I am a practical person. I never plunge headlong into anything 
            without weighing the consequences. I evaluate the situation and 
            handle matters accordingly. I am also very patient. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest weakness<br>
            </b>I can never be harsh. My kindness has prompted people to take 
            advantage of me. I know this comes in the way of efficient 
            administration at times, but still I continue to be gentle. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Biggest regret </b><br>
            All our products are meant for a niche market. I really wish we had 
            a volume market car in our portfolio. We did have a few 
            opportunities to acquire such franchises; however, for many reasons, 
            we still haven't added such a product. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Success formula <br>
            </b>At a personal level, the guidance from the promoter of the 
            organisation has helped me to succeed. I ensure that I maintain good 
            customer relations. Despite my multifarious responsibilities, I have 
            never distanced myself from direct contact with the customers. Over 
            a period of time, this has helped me build an excellent rapport with 
            them and they always come back to MHD. We also lay great emphasis on 
            after-sales support and service. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Competition <br>
            </b>We do face tough competition even in the luxury car segment. We 
            respect healthy competition, and recognise its importance in 
            motivating everyone to excel. We plan our strategies in accordance 
            with competition; however, we do not believe in gimmickry and stay 
            out of undercutting races. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Motivators <br>
            </b>The unquestioning confidence that my directors have reposed in 
            me has urged me to give my best to the organisation.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Inspirations <br>
            </b>I enjoy reading history. Success stories of historical figures 
            reiterate my belief that anything is possible with hard work and 
            planning. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tips to succeed <br>
            </b>Honesty and sincerity are the keys to long-term success. I 
            constantly remind my staff never to mislead customers even if it 
            means losing a deal. Customers respect those who have their facts 
            straight. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Future plans <br>
            </b>We are on the path of expansion. We will be adding more brands 
            and products and expanding our network. At a personal level, this 
            will be my last job before retirement. When I retire, I intend to 
            travel extensively. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Family<br>
            </b>I got married in 1972, and my wife is a full-time homemaker. Our 
            daughter is a doctor and lives in the US with her husband. Our son 
            is also there, studying in a university.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Hobbies</b><br>
            I enjoy reading and travelling. I was active in sports earlier. I am 
            also involved with charity work through the church.</font><hr color="#CC3333">

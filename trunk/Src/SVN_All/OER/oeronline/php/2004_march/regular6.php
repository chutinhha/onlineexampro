            <b>Tell OER about your career.
</b><br>
            After schooling at The Hyderabad Public School in the
Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, I studied a degree in
Chemical Engineering at the Osmania University of
Hyderabad. I graduated with first class distinction in 1978. I
then began my professional career working with Bakelite
Hylam as a trainee engineer. A year later, Said Al Hinai, the
founder of Poly Products, visited
India on a business trip. He
was on the lookout for companies
that he could potentially
tie-up with to produce foam
mattresses in Oman in order to
broaden his existing business
Fahmy Furniture. While he was
in Hyderabad, we had the good
fortune to meet and he asked
me if I was interested in helping
him to create a manufacturing
business from scratch.
Although I was keen to continue
my studies, I knew such
opportunities and challenges
come only once-in-a-lifetime,
so I took the plunge. I have
never looked back since and I
certainly have no regrets.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>This is Poly Products'
silver anniversary year.
What major milestones
has it achieved?</b><br>
Poly Products began modestly
in August 1979 with only nine
employees in a small shed with
an area of about 2,000 square
metres in Darsait. Today, the
company has an impressive
45,000 square metre manufacturing
complex, a workforce of
more than 500 and it has created
Raha - Oman's leading
brand of bedding and furniture.
So evidently, there has
been a lot of success in the past.
<br>
            <br>
            To begin with, Poly
Products was involved only in
rigid foam insulation. We began
producing foam mattresses in
1980 but we did not begin to
brand our products until 1983 at
which time we had moved into
the manufacture of spring mattresses
which would be retailed
in local furniture shops. By 1985,
the company moved to a new factory located in Rusayl
Industrial Estate. In fact, our plant was inaugurated on the
same day as the industrial estate. By the end of the year, production
was in full swing.<br>
            <br>
By 1987, the brand name Raha was born. It was coined by
Mr. Al Hinai who says that the name, which means 'comfort'
or 'relaxation' in Arabic, came to him in his sleep. At around
&nbsp;the same time, we were looking at exporting our spring mattresses abroad. The UAE was the obvious market to look 
at
first because of its proximity. Although we first entrusted our
marketing to an agent, to gain better results we chose to start
our own company there to take charge of warehousing, marketing
and distributing Raha branded products. Similar
warehousing and sales offices were set up in Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia followed soon afterwards. Today, around 55 to
60 per cent of the goods Poly Products produces are exported,
mostly to the GCC.
<br>
            <br>
            In the region, Poly Products has one of the most comprehensive
range of the finest soft furnishings from mattresses
and linens, to cushions and upholstery. Indeed, our company
now supplies mattresses to Sheraton hotels across the
Middle East, Africa and India by arrangement with Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts and last year struck another deal
with Meridien hotels for most of their properties in the
region. This is aside from the tens of thousands of Raha beds
that already furnish some of the best hotels in the world.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>What are the secrets to the success of Raha?
</b><br>
            We have never compromised our commitment to quality
products and service at a reasonable price. We know our
products are not the cheapest but we believe they are still
great value for money. Raha is a brand that people have
come to know and trust and we have to live up to this trust
at any cost.
<br>
            <br>
            The Middle East markets are notoriously price sensitive.
When our company first introduced a premium brand with
outstanding quality, few were convinced of the superior
value we also offered. In the early days of our business, few
customers were interested in a warranty. The challenge was
to convince major buyers like the Ministries that they would
be saving money if they bought better mattresses that were
more durable and came with a warranty.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How important has it been for your
company to tie-up with the mattress
maker Simmons?</b> <br>
            Our tie-up with Simmons, a US company
with a distinguished history of pioneering
achievements, leadership and innovation, has
been very important. Simmons' research and
development in the bedding industry is second
to none and it has many patents and
firsts to its credit. Raha is the sole Simmons
licensee in the Middle East. Our association
with Simmons means a lot because we can
learn a lot from them about the latest technologies
in the industry and our discerning
customers get well made, highly scientifically
developed mattresses.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>Raha's slogan is 'The Power to
Dream'. What do you dream about?
</b><br>
            I sometimes dream that I am a talented musician
but there is little chance of this wish coming true. One of
my dreams that has come true was for Raha to take on international
brands. There was a lot of disbelief that a country like
Oman could compete with bedding imports from Italy,
Germany and Yugoslavia, but Raha confounded the sceptics.<br>
            <br>
How do you make use of your free time when
you're awake?<br>
Mostly on the weekends I like to spend time with my family.
Some evenings I play cricket with my youngest son. The Raha cricket team has famously won may many trophies but
I'm not good enough to play in it. I also enjoy reading novels
and humorous works from authors like Spike Milligan
and Woody Allen.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>February 9th was Oman's Industries Day.
How are the country's factories performing?
</b><br>
            If you read what the papers recently, you will find a number
of positive reports that indicate that the number of sick factory
units is lower than in previous years. Overall, I would agree
that industries in Oman are doing much better now than
before. The country is looking at its manufacturing base to create
jobs and contribute to GDP. But foreign competition is
becoming more severe. In terms of furniture making, our company
is facing pressure on margins from countries like China.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>Which places do you enjoy visiting when you want to relax aside 
            from your bedroom? <br>
            </b>One of my favourite places that I have visited to relax has been
Cyprus. I guess I enjoyed staying there because it was not a
planned holiday but more of a spur of the moment trip. I rented
a car and simply drove around the countryside at my leisure
and avoided the usual planned sightseeing tours. I have always
enjoyed visiting places such as New Orleans, San Francisco and Sante Fe in the US and San Juan in Puerto Rico.</font></p>

            us about your career...</b><br>
            I did B.Com (Honours) from Bombay University in 1970. Thereafter, I 
            was made FCA (Fellow Chartered Accountant) in early 1980s having 
            been made ACA (Associate Chartered Accountant) in 1974 by the 
            Institute of Chartered Accountants. Also, I am an AMP Graduate of 
            Harvard University (1995).<br>
            <br>
            I started working in India in 1974 with Glaxo, a pharmaceuticals, 
            food &amp; chemicals multinational corporation. In 1998, I moved to 
            Indian Organic Chemicals, which is in polyester, software and 
            organic chemicals, where my last position was President (Finance). 
            My next destination was Tata Electric Companies in 1994. Within a 
            year of joining, I was appointed to the Board as Director (Finance).
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2000, I came to Oman as CEO of four companies in the Suhail 
            Bahwan Group and, in addition, had other corporate responsibilities. 
            In February 2003, I moved to OTE. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What changes have you witnessed in the business environment 
            during your stay in Oman so far? </b><br>
            I have been in Oman for three-and-a-half years. When I came in 2000, 
            the country's economy was just recovering from unusually low oil 
            prices. Since then, the government has been judicious in its 
            budgeting and spending, increasing the Central Reserve Fund. 
            Priority has been accorded to non-oil sectors. Privatisation has 
            moved ahead, although slowly. The economy is more confident and in a 
            position to take shocks. The only negative factor is the drop in oil 
            production. Hopefully, this will be tackled and resolved soon. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What drives OTE? </b><br>
            Four important factors have helped to put OTE on the top: <br>
            <b>a) Customer care and focus:</b> The main thing for any car 
            company is to take care of their customers, and that's what we place 
            a lot of emphasis on. For instance, we have 24-hour roadside 
            assistance anywhere in Oman and the UAE, which entails a free 
            pick-up for the customer and his car at any point in time. Mind you, 
            it's a very expensive proposition for us but, at the same time, 
            means peace of mind for our customers. Similarly, we have an 
            excellent complaint response programme, which is monitored by my 
            office. If any complaint is not addressed in 48 hours, it is 
            escalated to me, and this acts as a deterrent. <br>
            <br>
            <b>b) Continuous innovation: </b>We are in a small market and we 
            have to constantly try out something new. This Ramadan, for 
            instance, we had the Waleema scheme, which was the first time such a 
            scheme was launched in Oman. It met with tremendous success. 
            Similarly, we are credited with a lot of firsts - 24-hour road 
            service, Faeeda Car, hotline etc. - in Oman. <br>
            <br>
            <b>c) Heavy investment in infrastructure:</b> In a small country 
            like Oman, we have 22 showrooms, 14 workshops, five quick service 
            centres, 60 electronics outlets, 600 spare parts outlets and over 
            1,000 tyres outlets. Out of these, we opened three new showrooms, 
            two service centres and one quick service centre in 2003, and we are 
            continuing making such investments. <br>
            <br>
            <b>d) Confidence in our brands:</b> This goes without saying. It'll 
            suffice to mention here that OTE has the largest market share for 
            Hyundai, Subaru and Isuzu in the entire GCC. Not only that, OTE 
            sells the largest number of Subaru vehicles in the Gulf. Considering 
            the fact that Oman is a small market, that is saying something. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What according to you is the most important accelerator for 
            business? </b><br>
            Businesses are like cars. Every component is important for its 
            smooth running. If even one wheel is missing, the car cannot move. 
            As in a well-tuned car, you need perfect harmony among all the 
            participants of a business. To sum up, important accelerators of 
            business are happy customers, happy employees, happy principals and 
            a happy owner! <br>
            <br>
            In terms of our vehicle speed, it would mean driving faster than the 
            conditions permit. For instance, in Ruwi High Street, a speed of 
            even 30 km would be too fast if there was a lot of pedestrian 
            traffic. The same holds good for anything in professional growth. It 
            would be too fast if your family life or your health is affected 
            and, for a company, too fast is if you run out of money or 
            compromise on quality to meet volumes. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What is the importance of teamwork? </b><br>
            I firmly believe in the adage that 'none of us is smarter than all 
            of us'. Unless everybody pulls in the same direction, the company 
            cannot progress. Irrespective of how brilliant or capable an 
            individual may be, he has to carry the team with him. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Can you briefly sum up your preferred management style... </b>
            <br>
            Without a doubt, you could call me a compulsive delegator. In fact, 
            one of the first things I did was to make my general managers wholly 
            responsible for both revenues and costs in their franchise. 
            Otherwise, I would land up with the impossible task of doing the job 
            of everyone in the company except mine! It has been known to happen!
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What would you do to bring out the best in your employees? </b>
            <br>
            To bring out the best in employees, delegate both responsibility and 
            accountability. It does not work if you delegate only one. Also, 
            treat them fairly and reward them handsomely when they perform well.
            <br>
            If you weren't working with OTE, where would you be? If I weren't 
            with OTE, I would have been in my own business or with a venture 
            capitalist. I enjoy setting up new businesses or improving the 
            existing ones by defining the objectives, setting up systems and 
            controls and leaving the managers to manage. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What are your hobbies?</b><br>
            Reading (now I only have time for business-related reading) and 
            listening to music - mostly jazz. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which business guru's philosophy do you subscribe to and why? </b>
            <br>
            None! There is no 'one size fits all' in business. Each situation, 
            each issue, each company is different and needs a unique philosophy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which car do you drive? </b><br>
            Cadillac STS (Seville). It is a dream car. It has all the bells and 
            whistles, but also has a powerful soundless engine, very comfortable 
            interiors and a very smooth trouble free drive. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What is your favourite mode of travel? </b><br>
            For long distance - air, for work - car, for pleasure - 4-wheel 
            drive or a train. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What has been you biggest mistake in your professional life? </b>
            <br>
            Not setting up my own business earlier. <br>
            <br>
            What do you consider as your biggest strength and biggest weakness?
            <br>
            I humbly consider that my biggest strength has been the capability 
            to consistently deliver growth and profitability in a wide variety 
            of different industries, situations, type of company MNC, family 
            concern, etc. <br>
            My biggest weakness is that I trust people and it takes me long to 
            recover if that trust is betrayed.</font></p>

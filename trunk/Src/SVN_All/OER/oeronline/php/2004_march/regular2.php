What You Preach</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
By David Maister <br>
Price: RO 6.800 <br>
(Paperback) 250pp <br>

<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1" color="#FF0000"><b>
<img border="0" src="im7.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="139" height="216"></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">It's 
official! Look after your employees and your company will m</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ake 
lots of money. <br>
<br>
David Maister analyses data from twenty-nine firms around the world, and 
concludes that effective people management drives financial success. <br>
<br>
Through a combination of case studies, interviews and quantitative analysis, 
Maister identifies characteristics shared by managers in 'superstar' companies. 
In all cases, they are great leaders and role models, with strong principles and 
tough standards. They promote team work, a sense of community and an element of 
fun; they provide development opportunities, fair compensation and incentive 
schemes. Maister shows that their motivated employees provide quality customer 
service and ultimately influence the bottom line.<br>
<br>
Practice What You Preach is convincing, easy to read
and to dip into. For the busy manager, Maister obligingly
lists practical tips for selecting, developing and energising
staff and for cultivating your customers. <br>
<br>
Case studies are mostly from the highly-competitive
and customer-focused world of PR and marketing. The
book's lessons, however, can be applied by any manager
who is self-<i><img border="0" src="im8.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="90" height="107"></i>aware, receptive to change and eager for success.
<br>
<br>
World-wide, the book has already been recognised as a
winner. It could have an equal
impact on the fortunes of any
Omani company or organisation,
large or small. All we need is to
practice what we preach. <br>

<img border="0" src="im9.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="150" height="209">The 12 Clichés of Selling
</b></font><br>
By Barry Farber
<br>
Price: RO5.500
<br>
(Paperback) 252pp
<br>
Workman
Publishing<br>
<br>
I think business
consultant Barry
Farber has done a
fantastic job in writing
a book that goes
back to the basics of
selling. The '12
Clichés of Selling'
[and why they work]
is all about expressions
so frequently used that they become clichés.
<br>
<br>
Even so these age old sayings are packed with meaning
and wisdom as Farber explores in each chapter. The
examples are excellent and well suited to the topics.
His practical ways of implementing these principles
bring the book to life and will help you relate where you
can apply them at work. The re-cap at the end of each
chapter is a handy reference should you ever want to go
back to the book as a summary.
<br>
<br>
At a time where dissection of old methods and creating
new ideas for selling seem to be a norm, this book is a
refreshing reminder that 'old is gold'.
<br>
<br>
From 'The Relationship is Everything' to 'Never Take
No for an Answer', from 'Knowledge is Power,' to 'You
Get What You Pay For,' The 12 Clichés of Selling reconsiders
such phrases and breaks each one down while providing
insightful and constructive real-world-of-selling
applications. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="im10.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="90" height="115">Incidentally, Farber runs his own company training
over and is undoutedly a success.
<br>
<br>
The 12 Clichés of Selling is definitely
a book that will give you
knowledge. It is a must read for both
for newcomers as well as experienced
sales people.

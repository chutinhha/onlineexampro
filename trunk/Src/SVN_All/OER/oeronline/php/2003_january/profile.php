                    <img border="0" src="pty-11.jpg" align="left" width="184" height="251">For many years, Murtadha Ahmed Sultan, director at the WJ 
                  Towell Group, has promoted teamwork and productivity 
                  successfully among his colleagues. Nayl D'Souza meets him to 
                  gain an insight into the man's accomplished career<br>
                  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
                  Murtadha Ahmed Sultan has proven all his life that he can 
                  juggle several balls at the same time while getting results 
                  for the WJ Towell Group of Companies. Although it is unlikely 
                  that he would have pursued a professional football career if 
                  he didn't join the family business, his younger days of 
                  playing soccer in Kuwait demonstrated that he was 
                  quick-thinking, hard-working, and, above all, a team player. 
                  Today, Sultan is proud of all his accomplishments, and is 
                  always looking forward to deliver better performance and score 
                  more victories for his group. <br>
                  Aged 50, Murtadha Sultan started working with WJ Towell 
                  towards the end of 1975, after returning from his studies in 
                  the UK. His first responsibility was to help take charge of 
                  the company's activities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 
                  that was trading in commodities, building materials and 
                  properties. His stay of 18 months gave him what he considers 
                  magnificent day-to-day management experience together with a 
                  detailed knowledge of running the company. Since then, his 
                  enthusiasm to take on more challenging roles at the company, 
                  and his resolve to unfalteringly pursue difficult decisions, 
                  has boosted his stature among colleagues and the business 
                  community. Sultan's team finds his leadership style very open, 
                  patient, and measured.<br>
                  As a member of WJ Towell's board of directors, Sultan's 
                  current responsibility is to successfully direct the 
                  management of daily operations in the group's many companies 
                  including Towell Auto Centre, Towell Lever LLC, and Al Fajer 
                  Furnishing Company LLC. He is also the chairman of United 
                  Power Company and chief executive of Oman National Dairy 
                  Products Company (ONDP). Sultan confesses that he has always 
                  relished steering many companies towards profitability, 
                  particularly if they are struggling to find their feet.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Challenges overcome<br>
                  </b>'I was given the responsibility of turning around WJ 
                  Towell Computer Services, our communications and computer 
                  division,' says Sultan who reengineered the structure with the 
                  help of fellow professionals. Talking about the company's 
                  turnaround, he says, 'The style of management was failing. It 
                  was geared towards individualism rather than consultation. I 
                  helped to change this environment towards one of 
                  team-building, and encouraged better communication between 
                  staff.' As a result, motivation levels were soon recovered, 
                  confidence was restored and goals that were once set, began to 
                  be met. 'Our managers could claim ownership of their 
                  departments, yet they valued contributions from all who could 
                  take the company forward.'<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Building brand awareness<br>
                  </b>According to Sultan, the key to ONDP's success has been an 
                  emphasis on volumes and relentless investment on promotional 
                  activity while not losing sight of the margins. 'We firmly 
                  believe that we've made a significant impression in the 
                  customers' minds,' he explains.<br>
                  <br>
                  ONDP was established in 1976 as a joint stock company with WJ 
                  Towell as its major shareholder. Sultan joined the company as 
                  the managing director in 1990. He claims it is one of the most 
                  progressive companies in the Middle East today, and upon 
                  analysing its fiscal performance, one is more convinced that 
                  this is true. The company recently saw its profit surge by 88 
                  per cent, which it attributed to its leverage of fixed costs 
                  and reduced overheads. Net profit touched RO233,000 
                  (US$605,000) for the first nine months of 2002 from RO124,000 
                  (US$322 million) for the corresponding period in 2001.<br>
                  <br>
                  The company produces Zain, which is fast becoming a global 
                  brand and a leading household name in Oman. The company's main 
                  line of production is long-life milk and juices.<br>
                    <br>
                  Sultan says the total dairy market in Oman is worth around 
                  RO66 million (US$171 million). Despite fierce competition from 
                  other GCC dairy companies, ONDP has a market share of over 80 
                  per cent in the long-life milk segment.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sultan explains that two years ago, the company began 
                  producing Galaxy flavoured milk in Oman. 'We're very proud to 
                  be one of Galaxy's manufacturers because it gives us the 
                  assurance from an international manufacturer that our quality 
                  and processes which we have are very stringent,' he says.<br>
                  <br>
                  The milk-for-schools programme, which was recently implemented 
                  in the Sultanate and involves ONDP supplying the schools with 
                  long life milk at subsided prices, is another boost to the 
                  company's coffers, although Sultan observes this is a 
                  community-driven scheme.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>A powerhouse<br>
                  </b>Oman was the first Gulf state to open its power sector to 
                  private investors. In 1995, when WJ Towell established United 
                  Power Company (UPC), Sultan was designated to be a director 
                  after which he was nominated to become the new chairman.<br>
                  Sultan is hopeful that, in future, the company could negotiate 
                  to extend the operations period of the BOOT project 
                  (build-own-operate-transfer) or have the project stay in the 
                  hands of those private investors involved in the project, 
                  rather than transferring the assets back to the state or to 
                  other parties. He points out, 'The terms of such a negotiation 
                  are still to be worked out but if this were to happen, the 
                  electricity sector would benefit as a result. We've proved 
                  that the project is viable and that our company is capable. 
                  Our safety, maintenance and operational performance have been 
                  impeccable.'</font></p>

                  About 18 months ago, Sultan returned to Towell Auto's board of 
                  directors after a six-year absence. He says the rotation of 
                  leadership is not uncommon in the company and that these 
                  changes in the past have given family members a wider view of 
                  the company and at the same time helped to generate new ideas.<br>
                  At the same time, Mazda Corporation has braved the storm of 
                  financial difficulties and is moving up the ladder again, he 
                  says. 'With Mazda's new restructuring, philosophies and new 
                  teams, we've rethought our own strategies. We've closed all 
                  our used-car showrooms and we're offering more support to our 
                  businesses by boosting our customer relations units.'<br>
                    'In 2003, there will be some new saloons like the immensely 
                  successful Mazda 6 model. Mazda are becoming very aggressive 
                  and they will be continuing to apply pressure on competing 
                  brands this year,' he adds.<br>

                  <b>Building global partners<br>
                  </b>WJ Towell has been importing Unilever products into the 
                  Sultanate since 1925. In 1993 it was decided that a separate 
                  company be formed as a joint venture (JV) between the Unilever 
                  and WJ Towell. Chaired by Mushtaq Sultan, the JV has given 
                  both companies the opportunity to develop over 500 food, home 
                  care and personal hygiene product lines.<br>
                    'Unilever's alliance with us is part of its corporate strategy 
                  to join forces with strong local partners. It has brought an

                  independent director of the bank in 1992. He also studies the 
                  form of companies on the Muscat Securities Market, a bourse he 
                  has dabbled in on behalf of the company and for own interests 
                  since 1991. He says that he is a minor shareholder in stock, 
                  which can be kept for a relatively long period to avoid 
                  spending time tracking their performance day-by-day and 
                  week-by-week. 'I would define myself as a long-term investor

                            </b><br>
                  WJ Towell boasts of Oman's most illustrious corporate pasts 
                  and has a long list of firsts to its credit. The company's 
                  history began earlier than 1948, but it was in this year that 
                  the Sultan family created a small branch of WJ Towell in 
                  Kuwait to handle foreign exchange, perfume, motor oil and 
                  ghee. In the 1970s after the accession of His Majesty Sultan 
                  Qaboos, the company made inroads into different activities. 
                  Capitalising on its strong regional presence, the company 
                  developed its own Sultan brand line of imported foodstuffs, 
                  which were soon to be manufactured locally.<br>
                            <br>
                  Today, the WJ Towell Group is one of Oman's leading business 
                  houses, which is directly involved in the manufacture of 
                  paints, textiles, dairy products, building materials, and 
                  furnishing. The group also has a sophisticated information 
                  technology business, it possesses a major foothold in the 
                  retail, trading and commercial sectors, owns a huge 
                  construction division, has forged a share of the automobile 
                  market, and its investment portfolio participates indirectly 
                  in power generation, engineering and chemical industries.</font></p>

                  Inktomi</b><br>
                  Yahoo may soon acquire search engine specialist Inktomi in a 
                  deal worth US$235 million as it aims to strengthen its search 
                  services. Yahoo will pay US$1.65 for each share of Inktomi, 
                  which averaged at US$1.17 last month. The total value of the 
                  deal includes an adjustment for Inktomi's cash balance and 
                  debt balance. The deal is expected to be completed during the 
                  Q1 of 2003. The sale of the business unit was supposed to free 
                  up Inktomi to focus on its consumer business.<br>
                  <br>
                  Inktomi has faced increased competition from rival search 
                  companies, most notably Google. It recently cut 20 per cent of 
                  its work force. The company recently finalised the sale of its 
                  corporate search business to Verity for about US$25 million in 
                  cash. It also has deals to supply search services websites 
                  including MSN.com and About.com.<br>
                  <br>
                  Yahoo, which maintains its own category-driven directory, 
                  recently signed a deal with Google and Overture to display 
                  advertising linked to keywords in searches on its Japanese 
                  site.<br>
                  In an interview, Yahoo's chief operating officer Dan 
                  Rosensweig said, 'We have very good relationship with other 
                  providers.' The deal with Inktomi, he said, was part of 
                  Yahoo's larger plan to strengthen its search offering. </font>

                  <b>Netscape launches new browser</b><br>
                  Heeding the disaffection of people sick and tired of pop-up 
                  ads, Netscape has released a new version of its web browser, 
                  Netscape 7.01 that can be configured to block the 
                  interruptions. Netscape 7.01 includes other features and 
                  improvements, such as support for AOL's e-mail and minor 
                  stability and performance enhancements, according to the 
                  company. But the pop-up blocking is getting the most 
                  attention.<br>
                  Netscape joins EarthLink Inc, which earlier added a pop-up 
                  blocker to its users' software suite, and AOL, which no longer 
                  serves pop-ups from non-AOL Time Warner sources, in the trend 
                  toward dropping support for pop-ups.</font></p>

                  <b>Look, no glasses<br>
                  </b>Consumer electronics giant Sharp plans to sell notebooks 
                  and flat-screen LCD monitors that can show three-dimensional 
                  (3D) images. <br>
                  <br>
                  The monitors will let people see high-resolution 3D images or 
                  run 3D programs without using special glasses or additional 
                  software. For example, bodies and bullets appear to fly all 
                  over the place in a version of the popular game 'Quake' that 
                  has been adjusted to work on Sharp's 3D monitors. <br>
                  The technology also will be aimed at businesses, said Greg 
                  Nakagawa, senior vice president of Sharp Systems of America. 
                  General Motors has discussed experimenting with the technology 
                  in its modeling and design department. Medical imaging 
                  companies and e-commerce sites also are potential customers.
                  <br>
                  Bringing 3D viewing to the computing world has been a longtime 
                  goal. Although several companies have come out with web 
                  browser software and other technology to make images appear to 
                  pop off the screen, the web largely remains a two-dimensional 
                  world. </font>

                  <b>China closes 3,300 Internet cafes</b><br>
                  Around 3,300 Internet cafes have been closed down in China in 
                  a safety crackdown launched after a fire at a Beijing cafe 
                  killed 25 people last year. Nearly 12,000 other cafes have 
                  been closed temporarily while they make improvements. The 
                  fatal fire in Beijing's university district came amid 
                  complaints by some officials that such businesses were 
                  endangering the safety and morals of young people. Many 
                  Internet cafes were unlicensed and had no fire exits or other 
                  required safety features. <br>
                  Special filters block web surfers from seeing sites abroad run 
                  by Chinese dissidents, human rights groups, and news 
                  organisations. Under new rules that took effect November 15, 
                  2002 minors are banned from Internet cafes. Managers are 
                  required to keep records of customers' identities and to close 
                  by midnight.</font></p>

                  <b>Microsoft ordered to carry Java</b><br>
                  <img border="0" src="java.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="130" height="200">A US district court judge on Monday ordered Microsoft to 
                  include Sun Microsystems' version of Java with the Windows 
                  operating system, citing the software giant's history of 
                  undermining the platform-neutral programming language.<br>
                  The preliminary injunction issued by Judge J. Frederick Motz 
                  in Baltimore is a double-barreled victory for Sun. The company 
                  won preliminary injunctions on a copyright infringement claim 
                  and on an order to compel Microsoft to carry the latest 
                  version of Sun's Java Virtual Machine software.<br>
                  Sun is suing Microsoft for allegedly violating antitrust law 
                  in dropping Sun's version of Java and including its own 
                  version, which Sun alleges to be incompatible with its 
                  technology. <br>
                  Java is a programming language designed to work regardless of 
                  what operating system a computer has installed. Microsoft has 
                  long viewed Java as a competitive threat to its Windows 
                  operating system, which the courts have ruled a monopoly. Motz 
                  cast his decision in stark competitive terms, contending that 
                  Microsoft's actions benefited its own .Net products at Java's 
                  expense.</font></p>

                  <b>Sega's game plan yields problems</b><br>
                  Sega, the games software company, was expected to be the 
                  turnaround of the year, having pulled out of the difficult 
                  hardware market nearly two years ago to focus on developing 
                  software titles. The company's decision was applauded at the 
                  time as the right move that would turn Sega into a world-class 
                  software publisher, according to a report. But instead of 
                  enjoying a bumper year, Sega has been bogged down by slow 
                  sales of its video games and a sharp fall in its share price. 
                  In particular, after the company revised its full-year results 
                  forecast in November 2002, its share price was hammered as 
                  investors lost confidence in its ability to deliver its 
                  promises. <br>
                  <br>
                  Although the shares have recovered from a low of US$6.72 
                  following the revision, they are still only about one-third of 
                  their peak this year. If Sega disappoints during the 
                  all-important Christmas to New Year season, when it makes 
                  between 50 and 60 per cent of annual sales, it will find it 
                  even more difficult to regain investor confidence. But the 
                  outlook remains murky and Sega has suffered from a failure to 
                  develop leading software in each of the genres in which it 
                  competes, as well as weak marketing. </font>

            <img border="0" src="oil.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="152">OPEC oil ministers gathered in Qatar last month against a healthy 
            oil price background. Fears that international oil markets would 
            plummet as soon as peace broke out in Iraq had proved unfounded: 
            West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was fetching more than US$30 per 
            barrel as the ministers descended on Doha. As such, they felt 
            comfortable leaving their production quotas unchanged - despite 
            widespread speculation that they would be forced to slash output to 
            prevent a price collapse.<br>
            &quot;It isn't a high price, it's still in the band,&quot; said OPEC President 
            Abdullah Al Attiyah, also Qatar's oil minister. OPEC has set itself 
            an unofficial target of keeping the price of the cartel's crude 
            basket between US$22 per barrel and US$28 per barrel. &quot;We're happy 
            to see it in the band, we don't want to see it over the band. We're 
            working very hard to keep prices within the band,&quot; insisted Al 
            Attiyah. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Bearish outlook </b><br>
            However, the rosy short-term picture cannot disguise the more 
            bearish outlook further ahead. With Iraqi crude soon to come back on 
            stream - and the oil demand growth stunted by the global economy - 
            the medium-term prospects for prices are weak. The prospects for the 
            coming two decades are, if anything, worse still.<br>
            Dr Fadhil Chalabi, president of the Center for Global Energy Studies 
            in London, is one of the leading bears. Speaking in Dubai in 
            mid-June, he told delegates at a Massachusetts Institute of 
            Technology conference that fundamental supply and demand factors 
            strongly point to a weakening oil price environment. <br>
            On the supply side, he highlights Iraq. &quot;Iraq is a giant producer 
            that was kept dormant. Until 9/11, Iraqi production was not that 
            important: Saudi Arabia was the world's major oil producer, and the 
            United States felt confident about security of supply. Now that has 
            changed.&quot; <br>
            Chalabi says Iraq could be producing eight million barrels per day - 
            the same as Saudi Arabia today - within ten years. Given that Iraq's 
            oil is cheap to find and extract, he estimates it will cost just 
            US$30 billion to bring Iraq's production up to this level (Dr 
            Chalabi was once Iraq's oil minister). That's small fry in the 
            context of oil exploration and production budgets. <br>
            <br>
            <b>The demand side </b><br>
            Even more worrying for the oil price outlook is the demand side. The 
            Energy Information Administration (EIA), part of the US Government's 
            Department of Energy, forecasts that global oil demand will rise by 
            2.2 per cent per year between now and 2020 - a rise of some 44 
            million barrels per day. (Today, oil demand is around 76 million 
            barrels per day). <br>
            Chalabi admits that if this is the case, Iraqi oil supply increases 
            carry no threat. However, he says the EIA's forecast is wildly 
            optimistic. &quot;These mathematical models have proved to be erroneous. 
            They are based on assumptions that may not be realistic. I do not 
            have much trust in these forecasts because history shows they are 
            not reliable.&quot; <br>
            By contrast, energy major Royal/Dutch Shell forecasts oil demand 
            growth of just 1.1 per cent per year over the same period - a growth 
            of 19 million barrels per day from today's level. That leaves a 
            shortfall of some 25 million barrels per day between the EIA's and 
            Shell's forecasts.<br>
            A number of factors lead Chalabi to side with the cautious analysts 
            at Shell. &quot;The Kyoto protocol will sooner or later have to be 
            reflected in consumption,&quot; says Chalabi. &quot;The ratio of oil 
            consumption/GDP has been falling steadily. Taxes on gasoline are 
            high and rising while the technology for producing hybrid cars that 
            run on hydrogen and gasoline is getting better - Japan is already 
            producing these models.&quot; <br>
            He adds: &quot;This all indicates that demand for oil will not be as high 
            as forecast. Iraqi oil in big quantities will put OPEC in a weak 
            position. The price of oil could be lower for years.&quot;<br>
            To its credit, OPEC is facing the threat head on. OPEC President Al 
            Attiyah is well aware of the impact Iraqi production might have on 
            OPEC's quota system, and on prices in general. &quot;Iraq will come to 
            the market. That's their right. We have to help them and we also 
            have to make room for them.&quot; As such, OPEC economists are busy 
            crunching numbers in their economic models in Vienna. &quot;We should not 
            wait until the crisis comes,&quot; says Al Attiyah. (Iraq is a member of 
            OPEC, but has been outside the cartel's quota system since the 1991 
            Gulf War). <br>
            <br>
            <b>What next? </b><br>
            Against this conflicting backdrop, what is the likely outcome? 
            Chalabi may have a point when he points to weak supply/demand 
            fundamentals in years to come, but it would be wrong to dismiss 
            OPEC's ability to manage oil prices just yet. The cartel has been 
            written off before, but has a habit of bouncing back. In late 2001, 
            prices dipped to around US$17 per barrel, plunging OPEC members into 
            economic crisis. When push came to shove, OPEC used bully-boy 
            tactics to get non-OPEC rivals such as Russian, Mexico and Norway to 
            rein in output in a bid to support prices. <br>
            At the time, OPEC threatened to flood the market with cheap oil to 
            drive the price down to US$5 per barrel. The move would have hurt 
            OPEC members hard, but Gulf oil costs just US$1 per barrel to pump, 
            against US$10 or US$15 per barrel in Russia and the North Sea. 
            Ultimately, OPEC can send virtually every other major oil producer 
            out of business at the turn of a tap, and everyone knows it. Game 
            theorists will watch events unfold with interest over the coming 
            decades - but with OPEC holding the ultimate weapon of mass economic 
            destruction, it should be able to keep prices at reasonable levels 
            for some time to come.<br>

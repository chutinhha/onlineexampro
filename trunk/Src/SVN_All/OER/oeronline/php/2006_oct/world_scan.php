<b>Sony batteries recalled for a third time</b><br>
Toshiba has said it would replace about 340,000 laptop computer batteries 
worldwide, the third recall of faulty batteries made by Sony in less than 40 
days, according to media reports. <br>
<br>
The batteries, used in Dynabook and Dynabook Satellite laptops manufactured 
between March and May this year, could fail on the road because of problems with 
storing and transmitting power, Toshiba spokesman Keisuke Ohmori said. He, 
however, declined to estimate the cost of the move, saying it would not affect 
earnings, and would not say whether Toshiba was asking Sony to foot the bill. 
Toshiba said the faulty batteries would not cause fires. <br>
Although the batteries would die “only in rare cases,” that could happen 
regardless of how carefully they are used, Ohmori said. <br>
<br>
Dell Inc and Apple Computer had recently recalled almost 6m Sony-made batteries 
saying they could produce smoke and catch fire. Fujitsu and Hewlett Packard, 
which also use Sony batteries in their laptops, said no battery problems have 
been reported in quality control checks.<br>

<img border="0" src="google.jpg" width="149" height="56" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">Google 
told to remove Belgian news reprints</b><br>
A Belgian Court has ordered US internet search giant Google to stop reproducing 
articles, photos and graphics from French and German language Belgian newspapers 
on its news site, according to media reports. <br>
<br>
Under the judgement handed down on September 5, the Brussels court ruled that 
Google must pay an Euro 1 million fine daily if it does not comply. The internet 
group was liable to pay another half a million euros per day if it failed to 
publish the ruling on its Belgian website google.be continuously for five days 
within 10 days of being notified of the court’s ruling. <br>
<br>
The case was brought by Copiepresse, which represents French and German language 
papers in Belgium including Le Soir and Libre Belgique. “The way in which Google 
News currently operates causes the publishers of the daily press to lose control 
of their websites and their contents,” the court ruled. <br>
<br>
A report from an expert witness, submitted in court, said that “the use of 
Google News circumvents the advertising of the publishers who get a considerable 
amount of their revenue from these advertisements.” <br>
<br>
It said that “Google News short-circuits many other elements” like references to 
copyright protection or the authorisation of the use of data. In a statement, 
Google said it “only found out about this lawsuit and the court’s decision 
...almost two weeks after the actual hearing. As a result we were not able to 
make our case directly to the judge.”<br>

DP World, the world’s third largest port operator, is to boost container 
handling capacity at its terminals worldwide to 70 million units a year within a 
few years, from about 46.5 million at present, according a media report 
published recently. This will include a five million TEU (20-foot equivalent 
container units) addition at the port of Jebel Ali by the end of 2007, adds the 
media report.<br>
<br>
“Our capacity will increase to 70 million TEUs within a few years,” DP World 
senior vice president and managing director Mohammad Al Muallem is quoted as 
having said. He said Jebel Ali port’s container throughput was more than the 
total throughput at Indian ports.For the last four years DP World has recorded 
an annual growth of 20 per cent in the UAE, and this year it would add one 
million TEUs to its 7.6 million throughput of 2005. Under a $1.5-billion 
expansion plan, Jebel Ali will have a new terminal with a quay length of 2.5 km. 
“Once the new terminal is ready, we will be able to handle 13 million TEUs in 
this area,” Al Muallem is reported to have said.<br>
<br>
By July 2007, a 1.2-km quay will be completed and add three million TEU capacity 
to the port’s capacity. The rest will be ready by the end of 2007. DP World is 
involved in nine new projects worldwide, and these are expected to add a total 
of 24 million TEU capacity when fully completed. By 2010, the company will have 
13 million TEU extra capacity at the new developments.<br>
<br>
“We are still looking for new areas where we can have terminals,” Al Muallem is 
quoted as saying. In February, DP World acquired British ports group P&amp;O. Their 
combined throughput at 52 terminals in 30 countries was 36 million TEUs, with 
around 46.5 million of potential capacity.<br>
<br>
DP World’s UAE ports in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Fujairah had a capacity of 12 
million TEUs last year.</font></td>

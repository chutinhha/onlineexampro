</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Coloured crystals have become a 
personal statement in many Gulf households, thanks to Daum of France. Their 
thematic collections focus around art and nature<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="art.jpg" width="150" height="318" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">With the Middle East gradually going global and people here taking on the 
contemporary lifestyle of the West, coloured crystals are becoming favourite 
artefacts in the living rooms of many Gulf households.<br>
<br>
The Middle East is gradually growing into a robust market for coloured crystals. 
They are niche market products and the shops that stockpile crystals are all 
exclusive, high-end outfits. Art and nature are the two recurrent themes into 
which these crystals are shaped. <br>
<br>
A large segment of the purchases are made by repeat customers, who have 
developed a somewhat compulsive habit of buying these products since they are in 
vogue, and give a touch of glamour to the living room environment. But there are 
those who have a love for the range itself. These are the high-end buyers who 
take great pleasure in collecting and investing in art. For these art 
connoisseurs, coloured crystals are a traditional preserve, relating to them on 
an emotional level, having collected them over the years. <br>
<br>
Daum of France has played a key role in bringing coloured crystals to the Middle 
East market that comprises high-end outlets in Kuwait, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Jordan, 
Teheran, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Bahrain, Syria, Oman and Doha. Wherever the 
company launches a collection, there is a thematic undercurrent to it. Daum 
launches 2-3 collections every year. For example, for the China collection, Daum 
took inspiration from old Chinese pieces partly sourced from Chinese artists.
<br>
<br>
Theme selection is vital for the company, for therein lies its identity. For a 
particular year, a theme is selected by Daum’s design director. They are planned 
two years in advance. Since manufacturing is a time consuming process, a 
sufficient time-cushion is preserved. Sourcing artists is another major 
exercise. Most of the time, artists are outsourced but now a growing number of 
designers have expressed their willingness to work with Daum, owing to the name 
and credibility it has earned in the market. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="art1.jpg" width="250" height="162" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Around 10 per cent of the annual turnover of Daum comes from the growing market 
of Middle East, courtesy its strong distribution network. The growing segment of 
new collectors explains the spiralling turnover of the company. <br>
<br>
Exhibitions play a major role in showcasing Daum’s products. As part of its 
marketing strategy to showcase its ware, Daum takes part in two exhibitions 
annually – one at Paris and the other at Milan. The objective is threefold – to 
show Daum’s collections and range of products, to attract artists and retailers.
<br>
<br>
Founded in 1878, Daum, has broad-based the export market of this exclusive ware 
over the years. Markets in the US, Russia, Eastern Europe and the UK and now the 
Middle East are now evincing an increased interest in Daum brand. Exports bring 
handsome revenue for Daum’s business – a whopping 60 to 70 per cent. With a 9-10 
per cent annual growth rate, the future is certainly bright for Daum Inc.

<b>Keeping inflationary pressures under check is the main challenge for providing a 
boost to the economy in 2008<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="cover10.jpg" width="200" height="253" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Over the past few years, Kuwait’s economy has often looked like one of the 
heavily-laden super-tankers that so frequently leave the country’s harbours to 
make their passage down the Gulf: large, full of oil, and not prone to sudden 
movements. <br>
<br>
The country’s GDP has grown at over 5 per cent a year for five 
consecutive years to 2006. The combination of high oil revenues, which reached 
14.8 billion dinars (US$54 billion) in 2006 (95 per cent of government 
revenues), massive budget surpluses and the highest national savings rate in the 
world has led to the emergence of a vision of Kuwait as a oasis of stability. In 
its Global Competitiveness Report for 2007-2008, the World Economic Forum rated 
Kuwait the most competitive economy in the GCC, largely by virtue of these firm 
moorings.<br>
<br>
However, the supertanker analogy is not the full picture. Kuwait has 
also shown itself to be ready to act swiftly and maintain flexibility when 
necessary. The main event in the country’s economy during 2007, the surprise 
de-pegging of the Kuwaiti dinar from the US dollar, shows the country’s 
willingness to act where others in the region have hesitated. The Central Bank 
of Kuwait’s move from a dollar peg to a heavily dollar-weighted basket of 
currencies took place in May, as the declining US currency threatened monetary 
stability throughout the Gulf. <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, a number of challenges to Kuwait’s 
stability are now appearing on the horizon. Inflationary pressures are building 
up, although they remain much lower than in other regional economies. The annual 
inflation rate reached a record high in September at over 6 per cent. Despite 
the dollar de-peg, high global food prices will continue to contribute to 
price-escalation. Domestically, rapid price hikes in housing also show no sign 
of slowing down. <br>
<br>
But perhaps the greatest challenge will be kick-starting 
progress in both the oil and non-oil sectors, where a number of high profile 
projects have stalled in recent years, such as “Project Kuwait” and the Bubiyan 
Island port. The logic of oil capacity expansion in tandem with industrial 
diversification has been adopted by almost all GCC economies. While Kuwait 
agrees to this in theory, progress on the ground has been uneven. Kuwait’s 
economic indicators suggest that there is plenty of opportunity now for 
acceleration. <br>
<br>
In summary, since 2000 Kuwait has displayed a rising per capita 
GDP, a growing trade surplus, hefty budget surpluses and steadily increasing 
inflation. All of which can in some measure be accounted for by the rising price 
of crude oil, which continued its march toward the US$100 per barrel mark during 
2007, though it started slipping towards the end of the year. The population of 
Kuwait reached 3.37 million by the third quarter of 2007, and per capita GDP 
stood at US$29,064 at the end of 2006. <br>
<br>
The balance of trade for the third 
quarter of 2007 was accounted for by a 3.2-billion dinar surplus, up 6.5 per 
cent on Q3 2006. The national budget for 2006 exhibited an 8.8-billion dinar 
surplus, up from 7.2 billion dinars in 2005. The consumer price index, against 
2000 prices, reached 118.7 by Q3 of 2007, with the food and housing sectors 
showing the strongest growth. On the balance of payments, the country’s current 
account displayed a 14.8-billion dinar balance at year-end 2006, while the 
capital and financial account together showed an outflow of 13.6 billion dinars. 
<br>
<br>
In an era of US$80+ per barrel of oil, the commodity is naturally the main motor 
driving Kuwait’s economy. The hydrocarbons sector accounted for 58.8 per cent of 
the GDP at the end of 2006, and 70 per cent of GDP growth for the current year 
can be attributed to oil, according to the Central Bank of Kuwait. Production 
averaged 2.53 million bpd for 2006, bringing in export revenue of 16.2 billion dinars. But despite the record receipts and the boom-time prices, the outlook 
for the sector is puzzling. A plan to raise production capacity from the current 
2.5 million bpd to 4 million bpd by 2020 has been on the table for a number of 
years now, but in reality very little has happened. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover11.jpg" width="300" height="246" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="4">The expansion plan, known as 
Project Kuwait, sought to attract international oil companies to help develop 
fields in the northern part of Kuwait that required greater technological assets 
than what the state firm, Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC), possessed. However, as 
the contractual terms of Project Kuwait did not involve production sharing, the 
international oil companies found it to be an unattractive proposition, 
grounding nearly all work on the project. Independent energy analyst Kamal al-Harami 
argues that a change of culture is needed. “Delays have become a trademark of 
Kuwait oil projects. We need more international oil companies to come in and we 
need active leadership in the industry to move forward,” he said.<br>
<br>
Encouragingly, 
deals that plan to use Kuwait’s heavier crude assets that are more expensive to 
refine but offer better margins at current price levels than the fields under 
Project Kuwait are now beginning to filter through. An agreement between Kuwait 
and ExxonMobil to produce 900,000 bpd by 2020 is expected to be finalised by 
mid-2008. Among its non-oil sectors, the financial sector has shining the 
brightest, contributing to 68 per cent of the total non-oil growth in 2006. 
Through 2007, the industry has remained largely shielded from the worldwide 
credit freeze, partly due to low exposure to US debt markets.<br>
<br>
Looking forward, 
analysts are expecting a greater level of foreign activity in the local banking 
and investments market, in addition to the recent arrivals of Citibank, BNP 
Paribas and Bank of Abu Dhabi. In addition, as Faisal Hassan, Head of Research 
at Global Investment House believes, there has been “an increasing trend of 
Kuwaiti banks acquiring assets overseas. We expect this trend to pick up 
momentum in the coming months as domestic competition heats up.” On the 
regulatory side, pressure continues to mount for the establishment of a capital 
markets authority. Parliamentarians and the financial services industry have 
lobbied for the establishment of the body, partly on the grounds that while the 
Kuwait Stock Exchange is the second-largest bourse by capitalisation in the Arab 
world at nearly $200 billion, regulation remains basic.<br>
<br>
Despite a slowdown in 
growth during 2006, an upswing in confidence during 2007 saw the industrial 
sector post the largest growth in borrowings by any sector, indicating greater 
activity ahead. In particular, the growing building materials industry can 
expect full order books going forward, as residential and commercial real-estate 
projects have suffered from the regional price spiral of construction inputs. 
<br>
<br>
The privatisation of Kuwait’s loss-making national airline, Kuwait Airways, may 
be the major event influencing the country’s transport sector, if progress 
occurs during 2008. Government agencies reported in December 2007 that the state 
may eventually divest all of its shareholding in the airline. Kuwait Airways 
lags behind other regional carriers, and is widely seen as being in need of 
investment and re-branding. However, following the parliamentary block of an 
aircraft acquisition deal in August, investors can expect a combative approach 
from the house on any future sale of the national asset. The combination of high 
population growth (at an annual rate in excess of 3.4 per cent), an increase in 
property speculation, and a relative scarcity of land has seen property prices 
rocket in Kuwait over the past 12 months, leading the sector to become one of 
Kuwait’s hottest investment destinations. Prices have risen 12 per cent on 2006 
levels and further acceleration is expected in the short-term. <br>
<br>
Overall, the 
instability of the country’s northern neighbour notwithstanding, Kuwait has 
gained a reputation in recent years as an underperformer. But with an enviable 
level of fiscal stability and if inflation is kept in check, Kuwait can now 
afford to be a little bolder.</font></p>

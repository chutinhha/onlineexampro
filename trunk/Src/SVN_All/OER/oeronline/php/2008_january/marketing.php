<img border="0" src="market.jpg" width="350" height="237" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Rising oil prices, the spread of the sub-prime credit issue in international 
markets and the predicted slowdown in the US economy are all taking their toll 
on the confidence of global consumers. According to the latest Global Consumer 
Confidence Study conducted by The Nielsen Company, more than a quarter of global 
consumers expect a recession in 2008, resulting in a dip in confidence in 21 of 
the 48 markets Nielsen surveyed as part of its project. Thailand, Taiwan, Italy 
and Latvia lead the pack, with the people there anticipating a global recession 
in the next 12 months. Also, among the top ten is Turkey. Globally, over 50 per 
cent of the people are concerned that a recession will lead to unemployment and 
inflation.<br>
<br>
But for 40 per cent of the world’s consumers, there is unlikely to be a global 
recession next year. And, leading them are the two fastest developing countries 
– China (69 per cent) and Vietnam (66 per cent). It is a view echoed by Russia 
also, with over 53 per cent not seeing recession on the horizon. <br>
<br>
“In the world’s leading economy, the US, consumer confidence has seen a 
continual decline from late 2006 on the back of a number of negative economic 
indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown, a weak US dollar, rising oil 
prices and the sub-prime issue, all creating increased debt for consumers,” said 
George Mikaelian, Managing Director, Nielsen, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. 
“The unfavourable economic environment in the US is clearly having an impact on 
economies in the rest of the world, resulting in less upbeat consumer sentiment 
elsewhere”. Established in 2005, the Nielsen Global Consumer Confidence Index 
shows a continuing decline in global consumer confidence, with an index of 94 in 
the second half of 2007, down from 97 in May 2007, and 99 in the same period of 
2006.<br>
<br>
<b>Top 10 Ranking</b><br>
<img border="0" src="market1.jpg" width="175" height="250" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Globally, Norway superseded India as the world’s most optimistic market, with a 
CI score of 135, up two points from the May survey. India ranked second at 133, 
down for the third consecutive round from its peak score of 137 in late 2006. 
Scoring 124, this time round, Denmark was ranked a distant third, a position it 
has maintained for the past three rounds of the survey. In the Eastern Europe 
Middle East &amp; Africa (EEMEA) region, UAE and Pakistan are the most optimistic 
markets, ranked 11th worldwide scoring 112 points. Another indication of 
belt-tightening is the fact that 13 per cent of global consumers, said they had 
no spare cash after covering basic living expenses; and nearly two-thirds opined 
that it was not a good time to spend on things they want, putting holiday 
spending in doubt for the upcoming festive season. Across EEMEA, Egyptians, 
Turks, South Africans and people from the Baltics (Estonia, Lithuania and 
Latvia) were among the most cautious about discretionary spending, with around 
eight in 10 thinking now was not a good time to buy the things they want, in 
stark contrast to Pakistan and the UAE where over 45 per cent were optimistic 
about spending in the next 12 months. <br>
<br>
“Consumers around the world are cautious about spending – of the 48 markets 
surveyed, 26 recorded a continuing decline in their readiness to spend compared 
to six months ago – an important signal for retailers, who will need to put in 
the extra effort to entice consumers to loosen their purse strings with the 
festive seasons of Christmas and New Year,” added Mikaelian.</font></p>

<b>Major Concerns</b><br>
Irrespective of a global recession, consumers continue to worry most about the 
economy (47 per cent), health (37 per cent) and job security (30 per cent) in 
the six months ahead. Taiwan (74 per cent) tops the world with most people 
concerned about the state of the economy, followed by China (71 per cent) and 
Latvia (69 per cent)). In fact, seven of the top 10 markets most concerned about 
the economy were from the Asia Pacific region; the remaining three were from the 
EEMEA region: Latvia, Lithuania and Russia. Among the EEMEA markets, people in 
Latvia and Estonia (44 per cent each) were most concerned about their health; 
while Egypt (45 per cent), and the UAE (41 per cent) ranked among the world’s 
top 10 most concerned markets about job security in the next six months.<br>
<br>
<b>The Least Optimistic<br>
</b>The world’s most pessimistic consumers hail mainly from Europe and leading 
them are consumers from Turkey (74 per cent), Egypt (66 per cent) and Greece (65 
per cent).

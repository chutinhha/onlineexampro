Downturn in 2008

<b>The new industry financial forecast of the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) estimates a global industry profit of US$5.6 billion in 2007 
falling to US$5 billion in 2008 <br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="aviation.jpg" width="175" height="240" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">The IATA outlook for global aviation industry profit is unchanged for 2007 at 
US$5.6 billion. Higher oil prices (full-year average forecast of US$73 per 
barrel) were offset by strong traffic growth (5.9 per cent for passenger 
traffic) and even stronger revenue growth of 8.4 per cent. <br>
<br>
“For the first time since 2000, we are profitable. That is good news, 
representing a lot of hard work by airlines. Since 2001, non-fuel unit costs 
dropped 16 per cent, labour productivity is up 64 per cent and sales and 
marketing unit costs decreased 25 per cent. But with a 1.1 per cent margin, the 
bottomline is still peanuts,” said Giovanni Bisignani, IATA’s Director General 
and CEO. <br>
<br>
IATA sharply revised downward its outlook for 2008 to US$5 billion from the 
previously forecast US$7.8 billion. The spike in fuel prices is expected to add 
US$14 billion to the industry fuel bill, driving it up to US$149 billion (based 
on an average price of US$78 per barrel). The broadening impact of the credit 
crunch is expected to slow revenue growth to 4.7 per cent and traffic growth to 
4 per cent. Simultaneously, capacity expansion is expected to accelerate in 
2008, with an increase in aircraft deliveries to 1,281 (up from 1,041 in 2007).
<br>
<br>
“The challenges get tougher in 2008. A favourable economic environment and 
effective efficiency measures helped mitigate the impact of high fuel prices and 
underpinned profitability improvements. With the credit crunch, that is 
changing. The peak of the business cycle is over and we are still US$190 billion 
in debt. So we could be heading for a downturn with little cash in the bank to 
cushion the fall,” said Bisignani. While leading in absolute profitability in 
both 2007 and 2008, North American carriers will see the largest fall in 
profitability from US$2.7 billion in 2007 to US$2.2 billion in 2008. With 35 per 
cent of the fleet over 25 years old, the impact of high fuel prices is greater 
here than in other regions. Moreover, the region is at the centre of the credit 
crunch. <br>
<br>
<b>Efficiency is key</b><br>
European and Asian carriers will see minor drops in profitability of US$100 
million each to US$2 billion and US$600 million, respectively. Robust traffic 
growth to and within Asia is expected to partially insulate carriers from the 
impact of the crunch. Middle East will remain stable at US$200 million supported 
by ambitious route expansion. Latin America is the only region to see 
profitability improve by US$100 million to breakeven in 2008. This is largely 
the result of industry re-structuring. Africa will be the only region reporting 
a loss – of US$100 million last year and this year. <br>
<br>
“The common theme globally is the need for efficiency. IATA’s ‘Simplifying the 
Business’ programme is delivering critical efficiencies from e-ticketing to 
e-freight. In 2008, IATA will launch three major initiatives that will cut costs 
and improve service,” said Bisignani. <br>
<br>
“We will further revolutionise the travel experience with expanded self-service 
options to give passengers more control over their journeys. The new strategy is 
built around the success of the ‘Common-Use Self-Service Kiosk’, already 
operating at 83 airports around the world. Better baggage management will help 
mitigate the US$3 billion in annual costs from the 1.8 per cent of bags that are 
mishandled. And the IATA safety audit for ground operations will help reduce the 
US$4 billion annual cost of ground damage,” said Bisignani.<br>
<br>
<b>Bisignani on environment</b>:<br>
Our biggest new challenge is the environment, specifically aviation’s role in 
climate change. What is the issue? Aviation is 2 per cent of global carbon 
emissions. We are growing by 5 per cent a year and efficiency measures limit the 
growth in our carbon footprint to 3 per cent. But a growing carbon footprint is 
not acceptable for any industry. IATA’s four-pillar strategy addresses climate 
change:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin:0 10px; ">
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">Invest in new technology </font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin:0 10px; ">
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">Build and operate efficient infrastructure
  </font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin:0 10px; ">
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">Fly planes effectively </font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin:0 10px; ">
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">And once we have achieved all of that, consider 
  economic measures from tax credits for re-fleeting to offset programmes and 
  emissions trading.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">The strategy is producing results with shorter 
routes, best practices in fuel management and better operational procedures. 
IATA achieved up to 15 million tonnes of CO2 saving in 2006 and in 2007 we 
achieved a further 10 million tonnes in savings. Within this, route improvements 
are playing a major role–350 routes in 2006 saved 6 million tonnes of CO2. We 
expect 4 million tonnes of savings from 357 routes in 2007. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="aviation1.jpg" width="175" height="211" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Aviation is committed to doing much more. In June, I announced a 50-year vision 
for air transport, to achieve carbon neutral growth leading to a zero emission, 
carbon-free future. We are actively working with our partners to make this a 
reality. I am confident that aviation will be the benchmark for all industries 
on environmental performance. We can only achieve this if governments support 
global solutions. So, we took our strategy and goals to ICAO, where all member 
states endorsed the IATA strategy and our interim fuel efficiency target to 
achieve a 25 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency by 2020. Moreover, ICAO 
invited IATA to lead an expert group to map out the options to achieving carbon 
neutral growth and to develop a strategy to guide the efforts of governments, 
airlines and manufacturers.<br>
<br>
The big disappointment was Europe, which supported the global strategy but is 
taking a unilateral approach to emissions trading that is irresponsible and 
politically motivated and I would add, hypocritical. Achieving a Single European 
Sky would save 12 million tonnes of CO2 a year but Europe has been dragging its 
feet for nearly two decades. We have had enough of hot air – it’s time for 
political will and action! <br>
<br>
Let’s remember that emissions trading is not a solution for reducing emissions, 
it is a multi-billion dollar stick. But politicians forget that our US$149 
billion fuel bill is the biggest financial incentive of any industry to improve 
environmental performance and unilateral application of ETS is a breach of the 
Chicago Convention. I fully support any challenges by states including the US at 
ICAO, WTO or elsewhere. <br>
<br>
Let me be absolutely clear – we are prepared to accept economic measures as a 
political reality but they must be implemented as a global scheme that is fair 
and voluntary. In fact, our Board mandated us to work on a voluntary carbon 
offset scheme with a common emissions calculator and globally credible 
standards. We are working with the leading groups in the environmental lobby on 
this and eventually we may develop a global voluntary carbon offset scheme for 
any airline to participate in. <br>
<br>
But we must also keep focused on our ultimate goal – zero carbon emissions. 
Economic measures will not achieve it. Only technology can bring us to zero 
emissions. Some potential building blocks for a carbon-free future are here 
today; solar power, bio-fuels and fuel cells. The manufacturing community backs 
the vision from Airbus and Boeing to GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls Royce and 
also our fuel suppliers. Nobody has all the answers, but let’s remember that we 
went from the Wright Brothers to the jet engine in 50 years. And today – 50 
years after that – we are a safe global mass transport system for 2.2 billion 
passengers with commitment and common goals. I am convinced that a carbon-free 
future is absolutely possible.</font></p>

        <b>Usama Karim Ahmed Al Haremi,Head, Corporate Communications and Media, 
        Oman Air, tells Rekha Baala that he is in a profession where his brain 
        is working all the time, even on vacation</b><br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="lastpage.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="5">In the airline industry, effective communication is not just about 
        projecting the image of the company to outsiders. According to Usama 
        Karim Ahmed Al Haremi, it is like a constant battle: meeting crises and 
        challenges, diffusing tense customer service situations and chalking out 
        a continuous and consistent communication strategy that is in line with 
        the business objectives. <br>
        <br>
        And he should know this well, being the Head, corporate communications 
        and Media, at the national carrier Oman Air. His warrior spirit has been 
        solely responsible for the department’s turnaround. Usama has proved in 
        a short period of time that communications goes way beyond press 
        releases. He is on the job all the time. Long after his office closes 
        and as he heads home, his mind is still ticking. There is information to 
        be disseminated, press releases to be tracked, articles for the 
        in-flight magazine to be prepared and the daily aviation news to be made 
        available to all staff, and most essentially worries of having to deal 
        with unforeseen emergency matters, since he is the chief person handling 
        communication in critical incidents. <br>
        <br>
        There are, of course, serious issues that arise from time to time. Every 
        delay, every system failure requires efficient and quick handling when 
        it comes to communications. Corporate Communications and Media are in 
        charge of developing plans and strategies for areas of media focus and 
        communication issues managing such concerns. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Issues of image</b><br>
        The high-profile executive is both pragmatic and focused. It comes with 
        over 18 years of experience in both media and public relations in key 
        government departments. After completing his degree in international 
        relations in the US, Usama joined the Ministry of Information in their 
        PR department. He later moved onto Oman TV as director of administration 
        and finance. He was also sent by the Ministry of Information as 
        Information attaché to the country’s embassy in the UK where he helped 
        set up the attaché offices. On his return, he took up the position of 
        Director of Studies and Mass Information Documentation in the Minister 
        of Information’s office. He moved to Oman Air and a highly challenging 
        environment two years ago. <br>
        <br>
        “I am responsible for the image of Oman Air at all levels. I believe 
        that the image of the company reflects the image of the country. Things 
        were quite different when I joined, but I can now say that I have 
        contributed in making certain significant changes. Right from making 
        sure that Oman Air is in the news for all the right reasons, revamping 
        the in-flight magazine ‘Wings of Oman’ to establishing a strong link 
        between the airline and the media, I have been able to put effective 
        communication systems into place,” says Usama. <br>
        <br>
        For Usama, all work leaves time for little else. He admits that his 
        family does complain of neglect, even as he whole-heartedly agrees that 
        ‘he is missing out on the home front and needs to take a break soon’. 
        “Right now, I have a modest number of personnel working with me. I am 
        hoping that my work will be considerably lightened when more staff join 
        us this year.” It is an addiction that Usama cannot wean away from 
        easily. He calls it ‘commitment of a different order’. “I am in a 
        creative profession where my brain is working all the time. It is 
        impossible to switch off even on vacation.” <br>
        <br>
        <b>Taking a break</b><br>
        Not that, he has had one recently. Usama hasn’t taken a long break for 
        more than a year. However, when he does feel the need to unwind, he 
        visits the social club or the Al Maha Recreation Club and catches up 
        with friends. But things are changing. And Usama is all excited about a 
        trip this month to the Far East. Its time to put a full stop to work and 
        rejuvenate in luxurious surroundings. But this too will come after work. 
        “I will be attending an official event this month at Bangkok and soon 
        after it is over, I will stay on and enjoy a much-needed holiday, all by 
        myself.” <br>
        <br>
        We have now got him thinking about the beauty of the Far East, the 
        lip-smacking Thai food and the relaxing traditional Thai massage. As he 
        revels in the thought of his upcoming holiday, we bid adieu. <br>
        <br>
        A warrior too needs a break even if the communication battle continues… </font></p></td>

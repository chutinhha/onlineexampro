time and money for vessels passing through a coastal area known for its 
dangerous seas. Strong winds, high waves and powerful currents in the area of 
Stad, on the southwest coast of Norway, cause long delays while ships wait for 
calmer conditions. A recent report from the Norwegian Coastal Administration 
recommended building the 1,700-metre (5,577 feet) tunnel and concluded that it 
would be cost effective. The tunnel, estimated to cost around US$310 million and 
which will take five years to build, will cut through a peninsula, saving ships 
the risky journey around the coastline. <br>

<img border="0" src="world1.jpg" width="80" height="104" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">KPMG, the global network of professional service firms providing audit, tax and 
advisory services, has reported combined revenues of US$19.8 billion for the 
fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, versus US$16.9 billion a year earlier, 
reflecting double-digit growth across all service lines. KPMG’s advisory 
services experienced growth in all regions and grew fastest at 22.2 per cent to 
US$6.43 billion, fuelled by increased M&amp;A activity, heightened regulations and 
demand for performance improvement. Revenue from the Asia Pacific region grew 
21.6 per cent to US$2.55 billion in FY07, driven by strong performance across 
all practice areas, with both Japan and China showing particularly strong 
growth. Exceptional performance was also evident in the BRIC countries (Brazil, 
Russia, India and China), with aggregate revenues increasing by 41 per cent in 
the past year. In the Asia Pacific region, the influence of private equity 
funds, strong overall M&amp;A activity and the maturation of the capital markets 
provided robust opportunities for all of KPMG’s services. Multinational 
companies are capitalising on the investment in the booming domestic economies 
of China and Vietnam. Also, back office and IT outsourcing operations are 
expanding in Malaysia and the Philippines. <br>

<img border="0" src="world2.jpg" width="175" height="117" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">The search giant Google’s ‘knol’ project will offer encyclopaedia entries with 
bylines and advertisements. Google is working on a collaborative online 
encyclopaedia that could compete with Wikipedia, the popular user-edited 
encyclopaedia. The “knol” project – or a unit of knowledge in keeping with 
Google’s creative shorthand – will allow a user to create an entry on virtually 
any topic. Like Wikipedia, it will allow anyone to add an entry. But unlike 
anonymous postings on Wikipedia, it will post an author’s byline and profile 
with each entry. Another difference from Wikipedia is that readers will not be 
able to edit knol entries. Instead, they can rank them, with their rankings 
being interpreted by Google’s search engine in any search operation. Wikipedians, 
for their part, don’t seem to be losing any sleep over Google’s project. In an 
emailed statement, Wikipedia said it welcomed the initiative. “The more good 
free content,” it said, “the better for the world.” <br>

<img border="0" src="world3.jpg" width="175" height="122" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing spend increased 35.9 per cent in 2006 to $981 
million (from US$722 million in 2005) and is easily expected to top US$1 billion 
in 2007, making it one of the fastest-growing alternative media segments, 
reveals PQ Media’s Word-of-Mouth Marketing Forecast 2006-2011, According to its 
sister site, MarketingCharts, The growth driver is the continued consumer shift 
to alternative media and marketers’ need for increased brand engagement and 
return on investment. WOM marketing grew almost five times faster than the 
overall marketing services sector in 2006 (35. per cent vs. 7.7 per cent), and 
more than six times faster than the overall media industry growth and nominal 
GDP. WOM marketing spending rose at a compound annual growth rate of 66.7 per 
cent from 2001 to 2006–from US$76 million to US$981 million. Spending on WOM 
marketing is forecast to grow 37.7 per cent in 2007 to US$1.35 billion, as brand 
marketers continue to shift more dollars to WOM marketing tactics as part of 
their cross-platform marketing campaigns. Total WOM marketing expenditures are 
projected to climb at a CAGR of 30.4 per cent to $3.70 billion in the 2006-2011 
period. <br>

<img border="0" src="world4.jpg" width="123" height="83" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Harvesting bambooan abundant, flexible, 
durable and fast-growing grass, and using it to make notebooks was certainly not 
on the minds of Steve Jobs and Steve Woznaik when they built the Apple I, an 
early personal computer that consisted of a circuit board in a simple wooden 
box, in 1976. While their product allowed computer makers the world over to make 
advanced PCs in metal and plastic casings, Taiwan’s Asustek Computer Inc sees 
its success in bamboo. Its eco-friendly notebook PC is encased in bamboo strips 
available in different shades. The Asus Eco Book, as it is known, is unlikely to 
harm the environment as processing wood from trees might. Asustek says the 
product is still in the prototype stage and engineers are checking to see if 
bamboo is suitable for laptops, which have to endure extreme conditions while 
allowing heat from microprocessors and monitors to escape. </font></p>

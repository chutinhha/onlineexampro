<b>Oman <br>
</b>Diversification bearing fruit</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>
<b>Growth in oil revenues has increased Oman’s purchasing power and provided extra, 
and unplanned, revenue for the government to pursue its economic overhaul plans<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="cover12.jpg" width="199" height="240" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Over the past half a decade or so, faced with declining oil production, Oman 
has begun to lay the groundwork for an extensive economic overhaul. Many 
analysts believe that at the current rates of oil production, the country may 
have only decades before its reserves dry up. While new investment, technology 
and exploration may extend the life of the reserves for some time, the 
government, which depends on oil for nearly 65 per cent of its revenues, is 
aware that for there to be life after oil serious changes are required. 
Accordingly, it has undertaken a wide range of economic diversification schemes 
that include tourism, real estate, new port facilities and major industrial 
plants. Today, these are at varying stages of maturity. <br>
<br>
Like other oil producing 
countries in the region, high oil prices have buoyed Oman’s economy in recent 
years. The country has been doubly fortunate in that the high prices have 
actually more than made up for its shrinking production, which had reached its 
peak in 2000. <br>
<br>
In the first half of 2007, oil revenues drove nominal GDP up 8.7 
per cent. This has important knock-on consequences, as Sitikantha Pattanaik, an 
economist at the Central Bank of Oman, explained. “Nominal growth is very 
important in this part of the world. It is not exactly inflation – since it is 
so heavily skewed by high oil prices”. Instead, the growth has increased Oman’s 
purchasing power and provided extra, and unplanned, revenue for the government. 
<br>
<br>
This extra income is certainly welcome because the country has performed 
relatively poorly compared to some of its neighbours in terms of attracting 
foreign direct investment despite having good potential to do so, says UNCTAD’s 
World Investment Report 2007. Oman’s stock of FDI fell from almost 15 per cent 
of the GDP in 1990 to 11 per cent in 2006. This is even though over the last few 
years, FDI has made its way into more greenfield projects, from 14 projects in 
2004 to 37 in 2006. As a result, FDI flows increased from about 5 per cent to 
nearly 17 per cent of gross fixed capital formation over the same period. In 
recent years, gross capital expenditure has hovered between 18 per cent and 20 
per cent of the GDP, enough to stimulate real growth but not enough for Oman to 
keep pace with some of its flashy neighbours. <br>
<br>
<b>Real growth</b><br>
The International Monetary Fund has predicted that Oman’s real GDP growth will 
be about 6 per cent in 2007, considerably slower than the blistering 14 per cent 
growth rate expected for Qatar or the 7.7 per cent for the UAE. However, 
Pattanaik points out that “when you have a real growth rate of 6 per cent while 
your oil production is declining, it does mean that the progress on the 
diversification front has been very satisfactory.” <br>
<br>
In real terms in 2005 (the 
last year for which there are numbers), the services sector, which makes up 
about 60 per cent of the GDP, grew by about 7 per cent and the industrial 
manufacturing sector by about 8 per cent, while the petroleum sector managed 
just 1.8 per cent growth. Non-oil exports have been growing between 30 per cent 
and 40 per cent every year since 2003 and now account for nearly 15 per cent of 
total exports. In the first half of 2007 alone, they grew more than 70 per cent. 
With production picking up at several new plants in Sohar and Salalah, non-oil 
exports will continue to grow next year. <br>
<br>
The export boom is partially attributed 
to the declining value of the Omani Riyal due to its peg with the dollar. This 
has given Omani exports an advantage over some competing exporters. “A 
depreciation (of the dollar) will very much benefit non-oil exports,” says Pattanaik. “What people are discussing is the cost of the peg. What people are 
not discussing is the cost of not having the peg and the cost of an 
alternative”. Pattanaik suggests that the terms of the debate on the peg need to 
be brought into sharper relief with Oman’s broader policy of driving forward its 
diversification objectives and non-oil exports. <br>
<br>
There have certainly been costs 
also associated with the dollar’s depreciation. In 2007, Oman, like many 
surrounding countries, has witnessed record high inflation rates. Oman’s 
consumer price index touched 5.3 per cent in the year to October. The peg, which 
hamstrings monetary policy, has helped fuel the inflation leaving record levels 
of money sloshing about the economy. The money supply has repeatedly hit record 
levels in 2007. Year on year, it has increased by over 30 per cent, while total 
credit has increased by more than 25 per cent. <br>
<br>
Inflationary pressures have also 
been home grown. Large-scale investments into diversification projects have 
increased aggregate demand. For example, the developments in and around the Port 
of Sohar are expected at a huge US$12billion. Pattanaik points out that “at the 
same time, you want to diversify faster, you can’t because you don’t have the 
capacity. So you need to import it.” The problem is that much of what is 
required, from raw materials to human resources, is in scarce supply not only 
within the region but globally and this is pushing up prices. <br>
<br>
Ordinary Omanis 
have been hard hit by food and rent inflation, which shot up following Cyclone 
Gonu in June, which caused damages valued at between RO1.2-2.5 billion. Since 
June, the price of a basket of food for families has gone up by more than 25 per 
cent. Rent increases were capped at 15 per cent by the government to try to 
dampen the effect on low-income households. <br>
<br>
<b>Human resources</b><br>
In an OBG survey of Oman’s corporate executives aimed at understanding the 
private sector’s concerns for competitiveness and growth – conducted for its 
forthcoming Emerging Oman 2008 – a shortage of qualified staff consistently 
topped bosses’ worry-lists across the country. Many companies have had to adopt 
innovative training schemes to train new employees. Also, several bosses 
expressed frustration that their new employees, particularly Omanis with IT 
training, were often lured by higher bidders as soon as they had completed 
hands-on training or with only a few months of experience. This was specially 
true in case of corporates trying to meet their Omanisation quotas. Staff 
retention and wage escalation have thus become a serious problem for human 
resources departments across the country. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover13.jpg" width="209" height="340" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Next on the worry-lists typically were 
concerns over inadequate infrastructure. Everything from Muscat’s increasingly 
congested roads to insufficient gas supplies need to be addressed double fast, 
they say. Topping the infrastructure list for many in the service sector were 
worries about information and communications technology. Some bosses complained 
that they were running billion dollar plants by mobile phones because fixed-line 
and internet services were simply inadequate.<br>
<br>
Others pointed out that it is 
difficult to compete on a global scale when simple email attachments can be 
sufficient to bring down information systems due to the insufficient capacity of 
the country’s sole internet service provider. Many in the service and IT 
industries questioned how a knowledge-based society could be expected to emerge 
in Oman given the high costs of broadband, the monopoly on fixed-line and 
international gateway services. <br>
<br>
Many pointed out that opening up the rest of the 
telecom industry could rapidly transform Oman’s internet landscape similar to 
the way the telecom landscape was reshaped a couple of years ago when Nawras was 
allowed to compete with Oman Mobile. However, some action is indeed taking place 
on this front, with Nawras launching its 3G services in December. For consumers 
with 3G enabled wireless modems, the cyber-bottleneck appeared to have ended. 
One local market watcher told OBG, “I’ve just finally been able to connect to 
the internet like people elsewhere in the world – without having to wait minutes 
to open a webpage or hours to download a file.” <br>
<br>
Despite serious issues for the 
Oman’s economy in 2007, Cyclone Gonu and record inflation, it has performed 
exceptionally well on the back of a bull oil market. Most importantly, the 
country’s various diversification plans are beginning to bear fruit. Moreover, 
the recent announcement of a new free-trade zone near the Sohar port is likely 
to help reverse UNCTAD’s complaint that Oman has underperformed in attracting 
FDI. There is good reason to think that the government, which has shown 
generally excellent cooperation and coordination with the private sector in its 
diversification agenda, will work to relieve the economy’s new binding 
constraints and ease the growing pains. Policymakers will do well to remember 
that what is necessary for sustaining economic growth is often very different 
from what was required to kick it off. </font></p>

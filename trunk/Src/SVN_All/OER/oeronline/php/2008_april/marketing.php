Marketing Financial Services</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Financial services marketers in Oman face a distinct set of challenges writes 
<b>George Mikaelian</b> (Managing Director, BOQK) and <b>Tahir Khalil</b> (Associate Director 
Finance Specialist MENAP), The Nielsen Company<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="marketing.gif" width="420" height="201" hspace="6" vspace="3" align="right">In an increasingly maturing financial services landscape, marketers in Oman need 
to grapple with many issues simultaneously. These challenges for marketers, 
whether they provide insurance, banking or wealth management, centre around 
three key themes:<br>
<b>1.</b>Understanding the needs of your customers and prospective consumers<br>
<b>2.</b>Being able to position your brand(s) and product range in a differentiated and 
unique way <br>
<b>3.</b>Consistently developing new products and services that address your customers 
changing needs.<br>
<br>
Let’s take them one at a time.<br>
<br>
<b>The first challenge “understanding your customers”:<br>
</b>
</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Requires you to go beyond the industry-accepted lens of age, account balances 
and household 
income. 
<br>
</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">You need to gain insights into customers’ attitudes, behaviours and future 
intentions as well. <br>
When you have both the quantitative and qualitative data, it becomes relatively 
easy to prioritise and target worthwhile market segments. <br>
</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">Every firm wants to access people with significant assets to invest, but by 
creating marketing strategies that treat everyone as the same, you may 
potentially miss the opportunity to best address their individual financial 
needs.<br>
</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">In the past, discussions about consumers in the banking market focused on ways 
to ensure customers chose a particular financial institution or continued to 
stay with that bank. In a homogeneous market that has relatively similar product 
offerings, price was often the main variable marketers could tweak. <br>
<br>
Today, marketers face an ever-increasing challenge, with increased global 
competition combined with evolving markets and product proliferation. 
Discussions about banking consumers now centre on which markets to go after and 
which products will suit their needs best, i.e. niche marketing! As a result, we 
see more and more niche marketing strategies being deployed in the region as 
well as in Oman. The challenge for marketers is to equip themselves with the 
relevant knowledge and understanding of the market, in order to mitigate any 
potential risks in their decision.<br>
<br>
What you find may surprise you. For example, you may discover that segments that 
you thought were attractive (such as current customers) may not be profitable to 
serve, while other seemingly less attractive groups such as the youth or female 
markets, could be seen as a worthwhile investment for the long term. 
Interestingly, the youth are fast becoming the majority in Oman*. This coupled 
with the fact that there has been a dramatic increase in labour force 
participation rate amongst women in Oman over the last decade, means that these 
two segments need to be addressed accordingly. Ignore them at your peril.<br>
<b>
<br>
The second challenge “differentiating your brand and product range”:</b><br>
This is more difficult in the financial services industry than in some others, 
since in many cases there are few distinguishing features or benefits to 
highlight. To oversimplify, one bank’s transaction account is much like the 
others. Industry leaders, however, are able to find a way to distinguish their 
brands and product range, make them memorable, and carve out a niche in the 
otherwise commoditised marketplace through such things as faster transaction 
times or providing more convenient online account access or new branches, 
whatever the customer feels is important to them and the particular segment they 
fall into.<br>
<br>
<b>Third challenge “innovate &amp; align”:</b><br>
Finally, companies have to innovate to constantly respond to customers’ changing 
needs. For example, consumers are increasingly turning away from the branch 
network in favour of more remote channels. Firms that have addressed this need 
for improved remote access should be able to compete in a financial landscape 
that requires this channel. To be truly innovative financial services 
organisations, there is the need to be in a position to spot these trends and 
act on them quickly before the competition has even noticed the opportunity. And 
when this innovation is aligned to the exact needs of your segment, then 
financial institutions truly make above industry growth and profits.<br>
<br>
We believe that success in the financial services industry can only come from 
having a system that allows financial institutions to understand their consumers 
and their changing needs and being able to use this to identify the right 
segment to target with innovative products or services.<br>

<b>Owning a home of your liking has become a reality with a wide range of 
customer friendly housing loans offered by the banks in Oman. OER takes a look.<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="spotlight5.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Mohmmad Al Balushi, the 30-year old finance manager working in a prominent 
trading company and his wife who works as a marketing officer in an insurance 
firm, moved into their own 2-bedroom apartment located at Al Hail in January. 
“We were tired of living on rent. In the last two years, our rent had shot up by 
more than 100 per cent. We always dreamt of having our own house one day. A home 
loan from a leading bank with an equated monthly installment (EMI) not more than 
the monthly rent that I was paying earlier has changed our life,” he said. <br>
<br>
That’s not the story of Mohammad alone. Many young Omanis in their 20s and 30s 
are opting for buying their own house instead of paying spiraling rents. Just 
few years ago, people had limited options to raise finance to build or buy a 
house. They used to either save the money over the years and decades or borrow 
from their employers or friends and relatives.<br>
<br>
The credit for this transformation goes to the government for introducing market 
friendly regulatory reforms and banks for offering customer friendly housing 
loans options. In fact, if you open any popular publication or move around in 
the city or a prominent market, you are bound to get attracted to ads of housing 
loan products from the banks. Most of the housing loans products provide finance 
options for purchase and construction of new house, purchase of old house, 
purchase of plots, renovation or reconstruction or extension of existing house. 
They also promise to refinance the current housing loan at better terms.<br>
<br>
<b><img border="0" src="spotlight.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6">Ahli Bank - MyHome</b><br>
Ahli Bank, earlier known as Alliance Housing Bank, has recently launched MyHome, 
the new home loan product. It promises customers the benefits of largest loan 
amounts with lower installments. The loan is repayable in a period upto 30 years 
and the low initial installments make it affordable year after year. Speedy 
approval process and lower insurance premiums on both life and construction are 
added advantages of the MyHome loan. <br>
<br>
On the benefits of the bank’s new loan offerings, AbdulAziz Al Balushi, CEO, 
Ahli Bank said, “Our objective is to offer outstanding value to customers by 
providing knowledgeable, efficient and reliable products and services in a 
personal, helpful and responsive manner. Our customer service and financing team 
is well trained to offer quick financing and reliable service for the best loan

<img border="0" src="spotlight6.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Adding further, Karim Boukarroum, Head of Marketing, Ahl Bank Said, “Our new 
housing loan product is again unique; it’s the only one that offers high loan 
amounts with lowest installments because it’s based on low start repayment that 
increases only 2 per cent every year, which makes it affordable year after year 
as your earning power increases.”<br>

<br>
<b>Think before you act</b><br>
According to investment experts, this is the right time to buy a property. 
Living in your own house is better than paying high rents. Even if you already 
own a house, it is worth investing in a additional properties by taking the 
housing loan. With the boom in the economy, the demand for expatriates will 
continue to rise which will further push the rentals as the demand will be far 
more than the supply of residential units. But before taking a housing loan, one 
must do his home work well to get the best possible deal and returns in the 
future. <br>
<br>
Preferably speak to your bank about home finance only after you have identified 
the property you want to buy. Take a sanction for the loan only after 
identifying the property. Banks are known to reserve the best deals for 
immediate disbursement cases. <br>
<br>
Banks have different ways to calculate loan eligibility. If loan eligibility 
based on your income is likely to be an issue, then talk to several banks to 
find out which bank can give you the maximum amount. Remember to have own funds 
to the tune of 10-20% of the house cost. You should shortlist atleast 2-3 banks 
and get the shortlisted banks to compete for your loan. <br>
<br>
The cost of your loan 
depends a lot on your ability to negotiate. Remember that all terms and 
conditions of a housing loan are negotiable in many cases. Interest rates 
offered by banks take your income and repayment profile into consideration, 
apart from, of course, your negotiation skills. Apart from interest rates, also 
check various charges like processing fees, pre-payment charges, legal fees, 
valuation fees and other hidden costs. Take all these factors into account 
before choosing your bank. </font></p>

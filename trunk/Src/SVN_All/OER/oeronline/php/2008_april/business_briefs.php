promotion campaign ‘Origin Oman’. According to HE Ahmed Al Dheeb, Under 
Secretary for Commerce &amp; Industry, Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, “Origin Oman 
is a new think, buy and eat local business initiative from the Public 
Establishment for Industrial Estates (PEIE). The initiative aims to preserve and 
enhance the economic, human and natural vitality of Oman’s communities by 
promoting the importance of purchasing locally made products and services”. As 
part of the campaign, PEIE has also launched a dedicated portal 
www.originoman.om which facilitates the online business matching of local and 
foreign enterprises by allowing them to create and view company profiles, trade 
leads and product information spanning a wide range of industry sectors.

projects announced in Oman, is back in news. Rebranded as “Muscat Hills”, a 
cherished dream of His Highness Sayyid Kais bin Tarik Al Said, the project 
promises to bring the first PGA-standard 18 hole Par 72 championship green golf 
course in Oman. The golf course is designed by the internationally renowned Paul 
Thomas of Dave Thomas Associates and promises to integrate the sporting demands 
of a high quality championship course with the natural beauty of the Omani 
landscape. Chandra Lahiri, Group Managing Director of Muscat Hills, said: 
“Muscat Hills comprises four aesthetic and environmentally friendly parts that 
includes a golf course, an exclusive gated residential development, boutique 
resort hotel and premiere Country Club in addition to a tract of commercial land 
to house premium office space, retail and entertainment.”<br>
<br>
The first phase of the residential units comprising 80 deluxe villas and 25 
exclusive apartment blocks along the periphery of the golf course are expected 
to be ready by October 2009. The next and final phase of high-value luxury homes 
in nooks around the golf course will be offered by invitation only. He added, 
“Another noteworthy feature at our project will be an Academy, not only to teach 
the game to aspiring youngsters here, but also to train Omanis in the highly 
skilled vocations of golf course maintenance. This will provide high-quality 
employment for citizens not only in Oman but internationally also.” The 
contract, valued at US$110 million, for construction of the villas, apartments 
and infrastructure has been awarded to Larsen &amp; Toubro Oman.<br>

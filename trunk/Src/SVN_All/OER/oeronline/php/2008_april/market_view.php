<b>The MSM30 has not only gained in a period of global meltdown but also 
exhibited high liquidity</b></font></font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><br>
<br>
<br>
MSM30 Index’s performance was an indication of the insulation of domestic 
markets from the sub-prime crisis in the US. MSM30’s year to date (YTD) gain of 
almost 19 per cent, during the global market meltdown last month stood out and 
was the best performing index in the world (source: Reuters). MSM30 index gained 
11.5 per cent between February 16 and March 15, on the back of strong results 
and high dividend payout by companies.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
High liquidity in the market was well reflected in the average daily turnover, 
up by 35 per cent to RO18 million per day during this period. Some of the top 
performers were ONIC Holding (+34.5 per cent), Al Anwar Ceramics (+30.5 per 
cent), Al Jazeera Steel (+27.8 per cent) and OIFC (+22.2 per cent). Strong 
results and robust cash and stock dividend announcements by companies pulled up 
the index. High dividend paying companies were Omantel, Shell Oman and Raysut 
Cements, all paying dividend of 100 per cent.<br>
<br>
In corporate developments, Oman Telecommunications Company (Omantel) and Oman 
Mobile Telecommunications Company (Oman Mobile) announced the integration of 
both the businesses, a process expected to be completed by the end of FY08. The 
company expects to capitalise on the synergies of both the businesses through 
building internal capabilities and improvement of operational efficiencies. In 
other corporate events, the boards of directors of Muscat Finance and National 
Finance approved the merger of both the companies. Based on E&amp;Y valuation, 
shareholders of Muscat Finance would own 57.83 per cent of the merged entity 
while those of National Finance would own 42.17 per cent.<br>
<br>
In result announcements, Galfar announced a 62 per cent year over year (yoy) 
revenue growth and 39 per cent yoy increase in profit for FY07.<br>

GCC MARKET COMMENTARY</b><br>
Most of the GCC bourses ended on a positive note for the month ended March 15. 
The Saudi stock exchange grew by 5.56 per cent during the period, primarily on 
the back of buying seen in industrial counters, with the industrial index rising 
by 11.08 per cent. The Qatari bourse ended up 4.46 per cent, primarily due to a 
rise in banking and services’ stocks, which increased by 6.91 per cent and 2.96 
per cent, respectively. The Kuwaiti index was up 4.07 per cent during the 
period, with most of its sub-indices ending in green. Its banking and services 
indices were among the ace performers, gaining 6.48 per cent and 6.02 per cent, 
respectively, during the period. <br>
<br>
The Dubai and Bahrain stock exchanges ended almost flat, with the general 
indices increasing by 0.32 per cent and 0.27 per cent, respectively. While real 
estate companies topped the Dubai bourse, banks were among the chief gainers in 
the Bahraini market. The Abu Dhabi market, however, was the only negative 
performer during the month, with its general index shedding 0.87 per cent. The 
banking sector was among the worst performers on the exchange, with the banking 
index down 1.55 per cent.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS</b><br>
Oman Investment and Finance Company<br>
Oman Investment and Finance Company’s (OIFC) business model provides good 
revenue visibility, with existing contract periods averaging at about 
two-and-a-half years. OIFC has also illustrated its ability to retain existing 
clients without too many negotiations. A strong network in Oman amidst growing 
economic activity further strengthens the company’s bid for future client 
additions. Its major source of revenue (approximately 56 per cent) comes from 
the factoring business for Omantel. The company is involved in bill printing and 
bill collection from fixed line telephone, global system for mobile (GSM) 
communications and internet consumers on behalf of Oman Telecommunications 
Company and Oman Mobile Company. In recent times, OIFC has been able to 
diversify its client base, adding Oman Mobile for selling Hayyak starter kits 
and prepaid cards and Oman Qatari Insurance Company for marketing insurance 
products. For the nine months ended FY08, OIFC reported operational revenues of 
RO6.30 million, up 6.9 per cent yoy while net income (excluding non operating 
income) grew 14.1 per cent yoy to RO1.85 million.<br>

<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font size="1" face="Verdana">OIFC’s contract with Oman Mobile to market Hayyak starter kits and prepaid card 
enhances its revenue streams. The market for prepaid cards is expected to be 
around RO5.5 million per month. Apart from OIFC, there are three more players in 
the Oman Mobile prepaid card marketing business. A single competitor owns 
approximately 60 per cent of the market share while the other three, including 
OIFC, are new entrants. OIFC expects to sell approximately RO1.5 million worth 
of cards per month, utilising its existing infrastructure, with virtually no 
additional costs. Hence, the revenue generated from this business is expected to 
add to the bottomline. Though the business is lucrative, but given the 
unorganised nature of the market; OIFC faces intense discount rate competition. 
Hence, OIFC is targeting the organised retail sector, including retail chains 
and smaller shopping malls, by extending credit days. The business also 
generates positive free cash flow for the company.</font><table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">

<br>
OIFC has been able to expand its operating margins from 21 per cent in FY05 to 
33 per cent in the first nine months of FY08. The company’s growth in billing 
from Omantel and MHEW has been a major driver in this. Ongoing infrastructure 
development projects, economic growth and increased population in the Muscat 
region are all indicative of a further rise in consumption of water and 
electricity. Water distribution was badly affected during cyclone period in June 
and July 2007; hence, there was a slight drop in distribution of water in 2007 
compared to 2006. However, monthly figures show a significant uptrend.<br>
<br>
Trading at a 15 per cent discount to our target price of 688 Bz, and with 
approximately 5 per cent (expected) dividend yield, the shares of OIFC seems to 
be a good investment opportunity. We believe the company has the wherewithal to 
add more clients to further leverage its reach and strategic position in the 
debt factoring business. Our estimates may prove to be conservative, if the 
company opens any fresh channels or adds new clientele.

Suvir Ahuja, General Manager of GENETCO, tells Uma Devi Jadhav that golf, his

Ahuja arrived in Oman in 2004. His corporate life spans over 31 years now. One 
common denominator over these 31 years has been his passion for sports. He has 
ensured, literally, that every company he works with has one or the other sports 
team. Cricket team, football team, corporate sports! Ahuja is an ardent advocate 
of utilizing leisure time wisely. Motto? Keep fit! <br>
<br>
As he has moved up the corporate ladder, and the “age ladder” as well, he feels 
golf is the best way to relax. “Initially, I found the switch to golf rather 
boring, with hardly any physical activity involved. But having been a cricketer 
helped to get the swing right. I have come a long way with my handicap down from 
23 to 14. After that I have never looked back. I find golf a most enjoyable 
leisure time activity,” he pronounces.<br>
<br>
How often does he get to play? The busy executive, who travels a lot, says: “I 
have always been a weekend golfer. I manage to get a game every Friday either 
early morning, and if there is a tournament, then as per the timings specified. 
It takes approximately six hours for an 18-hole round, including travel time 
from home to the club and back. As soon as I came to Oman I joined the Al Maha 
Golf Club,” he reveals.<br>
<br>
“It is indeed relaxation with interest and challenge. The four to five hours the 
game takes, my mind is totally focused on how to hit the next shot, which club 
to use, the wind direction, etc. Since one plays every round with one or two 
golfers, we get to know each other better as we spend time discussing shots or 
putting strategies in a totally relaxed frame of mind. So I end up making good 
friends on the course. In Oman, I have been mostly on my own as my wife runs a 
school in India. My children are grown up and away. Thanks to my leisure time 
activity, I have made some fine friends here.”<br>
<br>
Ahuja says philosophically: “I have yet to come across any other activity that 
allows you to make friends in a new town in such a short span of time and yet 
stay physically fit. Also, if I play a good shot I feel elevated. On the other 
hand, if I’ve played badly, I have only myself to blame. You are completely 
responsible for your own game. There is no subordinate hitting your shot. You 
can’t pass the buck on to anyone else! It’s an important corporate lesson you 
are reminded of every time you play. One learns to accept all the ups and downs 
of the game. Eventually, you learn to do so in your business life too. I have 
learnt to relax and just enjoy the game!”

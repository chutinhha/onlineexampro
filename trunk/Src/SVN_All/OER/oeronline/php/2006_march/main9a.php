is something pervasively pink about Paul Bridle. His business card is pink. His 
handouts are pink too. “I am passionate about pink,” admits the self-styled 
leadership methodologist from the United Kingdom. The Zimbabwe-born, bearded 
leadership guru was on a visit to Muscat to talk on his pet theme: “Prevailing 
attitudes and the culture that directly impacts your bottom-line”. <br>
<br>
This son of a missionary couple now teaches leadership to a wide variety of 
audiences. Paul has something that appeals to his audience. ‘I may not be Tom 
Peters. But I am different,” he admits candidly. <br>
<br>
How different is he? “I closely interact with people at all levels and am able 
to see their points of view as well. Listen properly and you are bound to be 
rewarded,” he bares out the secret. In essence, he says, most of the challenges 
in organizations – small, medium and large – emanate out of misconception. 
“Communication is a perception issue. Whatever either side wants to convey to 
the other party, let them keep it simple. Challenges will vanish automatically,” 
he explains.<br>
<br>
What is new, one may wonder. His prescription may seem like common sense. But 
the irony of the matter is that common sense is very uncommon, he points out 
with a chuckle. Bridle’s knowledge or wisdom is not all bookish. He had walked 
the talk in the sense that he had played both roles: an employer as well as an 
employee. He has seen both sides of the coin. Political turbulence in Zimbabwe 
(earlier known as Rhodesia) compelled the Bridles to move to South Africa and 
subsequently to the United Kingdom. A labour unrest in the form of worker 
picketing at a factory left him a disillusioned man and he decided to quit. <br>
<br>
It was around that time in 1988, he began consulting. Small and medium 
entrepreneurs began to knock on his doors seeking guidance. Bridle recalls an 
IT-savvy entrepreneur’s predicament and how he fixed his ‘problem’. Running a 
business is different from writing a software code, he convincingly proved. 
Under his tutelage, the company turned the corner and the word spread about his 
“healing touch’” The next couple of years saw Bridle doing roaring consultancy 
business and lecturing on what leadership is all about. <br>
<br>
A voracious reader, Bridle has already penned a book entitled “Leader, the 
Never-ending Story’. His go-getting and friendly approach has endeared him to 
his audiences across the globe. “I don’t read, but study,” he corrects, trying 
to explain how one is different from the other. He is gracious enough to admit 
that his panacea for cures of the business world does not merit the tag of “out 
of the box thinking”. The success of any enterprise, according to him, depends a 
great deal on the attitude of people working for it.<br>
<br>
Fear is a major emotive factor that affects any relationship, he points out. His 
analogy is fairly simple and straightforward. Children always look up to their 
parents as a supporting block because the parents exhibit “consistent behaviour” 
– always protective in nature. In a similar vein, Bridle explains, workers 
expect a consistent behaviour from their superiors. Simply put, the leaders are 
expected not to be too clinical in their approach. They are expected to be 
accommodative. Not that wrong moves ought to be condoned, but they can be 
controlled over a period of time. <br>
<br>
And the incidence of fatal mistakes that may affect an organisation’s 
bottom-line can be substantially brought down, he says. <br>
<br>
Bridle is of the firm opinion that management, essentially, should tackle 
policies, structure and culture and leadership – with capital L – ought to focus 
on strategy, alliances and partnerships. Empirical evidence suggests that as 
against the essential doze of 40 per cent leadership, 50 per cent management and 
10 per cent functional work, one – irrespective of station in life – spends 10 
per cent on leadership, 40 per cent on management and 50 per cent on functional 
activities. Lopsided, did you say? No doubt! <br>
<br>
All said and done, what is the role of a leader? “To manage people’s perceptions 
and that includes the attitude people have towards their job, their colleagues, 
their customers and any other aspect of the job that affects their behaviour,” 
quips Bridle. Towards achieving this end, the leader has to understand the 
prevailing attitudes that motivate colleagues across the board. Begin from this 
perch and embark on managing people’s perceptions, and in turn, bring about a 
change in perception. On the surface, it may sound easy, but it calls for 
extraordinary vigilance and energy to implement. Good leaders achieve their 
goals effortlessly. Others fall by the wayside. which side are you on?<i>-

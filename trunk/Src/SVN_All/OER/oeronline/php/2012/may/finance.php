				UAE Exchange (OUAEEC), which started operations in the Sultanate 
				in October 1995, was considered a trendsetter in the money 
				exchange business since its inception. The legacy continues till 
				today as the company sees a growth in its business with 38 
				outlets rolled out so far all over the country providing vital 
				services to its customers.<br>
				<br>
				A wide range of services and products on offer have also helped 
				OUAEEC to become the preferred partner in the money exchange 
				business. The company can lay claim to being the largest 
				exchange company in Oman offering a wide range of fund transfer 
				options across the globe. Augmenting its capabilities and 
				services are the correspondent arrangements with several banks 
				which enable faster realisation of funds.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from this, OUAEEC acts as a collection agent for 
				settlement of credit cards issued by Standard Charted Bank, and 
				is also the largest supplier of foreign currency bank notes at 
				competitive rates.<br>
				<br>
				The company has different modes of funds transfer, like 
				electronic fund transfer through the company’s vast network of 
				correspondent banks and instant electronic money transfer 
				through Western Union and Xpress Money. OUAEEC is the only 
				exchange house in Oman, apart from banks, who has connectivity 
				to SWIFT, wherein STP (straight through processing) is effected, 
				in highly automated banking environments. This enables the fund 
				transfer in major currencies to be processed without manual 
				intervention.<br>
				<br>
				For conventional remittance services, OUAEEC has drawing 
				arrangements with over 60 banks/ financial institutions all over 
				the world for demand drafts and telex transfers. There is also a 
				loyalty programme for regular customers known as the gold card 
				which gives the convenience of a fast and error-free 
				transaction.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tough early days<br>
				</b>All this is a far cry from October 3, 1995 when OUAEEC 
				opened its first office in Ruwi with a few counters and nothing 
				else. On the first day of opening, there was no inaugural 
				fanfare and only one customer walked in. “It was a do-or-die 
				situation as there was lots of hype, huge aspirations and I 
				didn’t know how to go about it as we were new to this market, 
				although I had worked in the parent company UAE Exchange in 
				Dubai for a number of years,” says Tonny George Alexander, 
				Country Head, Oman UAE Exchange, the man responsible for the 
				growing the company to its present successful status.<br>
				<br>
				Alexander joined UAE Exchange in 1988 and worked in various 
				positions before being chosen by the company to go beyond the 
				borders of UAE and start operations in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				“One of the probable reasons why I was chosen was that I had 
				experience in all areas of operations. I never said no to any 
				job within the organisation, so by the time I came to Oman, I 
				had a fair knowledge of how to run an exchange house, right from 
				accounts, treasury all the way up to handling the IT side as 
				well. One of the things I learned in school from a teacher is 
				that education is a lifelong process. And I strongly believe in 
				that. If I find anything new, I jump in and learn. That is one 
				thing which has helped me in my life,” Alexander says.<br>
				<br>
				Although Alexander was new to Oman, soon he learned the ropes of 
				the place thanks to a tremendous foresight and keen acumen. At 
				that time, as per the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) regulations, 
				there was cap of only five branches per exchange company. But 
				Alexander had already identified more than five places to open a 
				branch. In 1997-98, when the CBO allowed up to seven branches, 
				OUAEEC opened its second branch in Ibra. At that time, no other 
				exchange house was present in that place. In 1999, the next 
				branch was opened and later, in Alexander’s words, there was a 
				spree of opening of branches when the CBO amended the rules and 
				removed the cap on branches.<br>
				<br>
				Referring to what made the company successful, he explains, “I 
				can boldly say that we are the trendsetter. We changed the 
				perception of what an exchange company is. When we came here, a 
				lot of people asked as to why we need such a big premise because 
				the existing companies had small outlets. We made a difference 
				with our appearance, our dress codes and our way of addressing 
				the customers besides introducing many new features and new 
				products.”<br>
				<br>
				One of the products OUAEEC introduced was the delivery of drafts 
				to anywhere in India at a very nominal cost of just one rial. 
				“This became a runaway success,” says Alexander, while adding 
				that this subsequently brought more customers to them and helped 
				the company to grow.<br>
				<br>
				OUAEEC does not believe in budging or cutting down on rates or 
				charges because nothing in life comes for free. Says Alexander, 
				“We do not charge our customers high rate. For example, if the 
				rupee fluctuates by 5 paisa per dollar, that will translate to a 
				rial per lakh of <br>
				rupees. That is risky for our business. And if I don’t charge 
				this one rial to a customer, tomorrow I can go bankrupt. If I go 
				bankrupt, that will affect the customers because people have 
				trusted us with their money, and if they don’t get their money, 
				God forbid on any given day, then we are not doing a good job.”<br>
				<br>
				“So it is better for the customers that we don’t undercut on our 
				rates because we need the shock absorbing mechanism. Many people 
				forget this aspect,” Alexander adds.<br>
				<br>
				The money exchange business has intense competition but OUAEEC 
				has managed to outgrow its competition and is presently the 
				number one in capital base, network, margins and profitability 
				and in any other yardstick for that matter. The company 
				completed 16 years in October 2011. <br>
				<br>
				Service is what sets apart OUAEEC from its competitors, says 
				Alexander, while adding, “We do keep a close watch on the 
				competition as we have accepted that competition is here to 
				stay. We cannot run away from that. There is a saying that if we 
				have to hit a running dog, we have to throw the stone a few 
				yards ahead. If we have to conquer the business we have to be 
				ahead of the competition. But for us, competition is not the 
				driving force; it is one of the factors. It is the quest or urge 
				to give a better service to the customers that helps us to 
				constantly innovate in our products and services.” OUAEEC was 
				chosen as a Superbrand for the last three consecutive years, 
				which showcases the brand strength of the company. Augmenting 
				the company’s position, Oman Observer consumer survey ranked 
				OUAEEC as the 1st among Exchange Houses and 7th among “180 
				Greatest Brands in Oman”. This is no doubt the outcome of the 
				excellent leadership of Alexander, who has been recognised as 
				one of the “Top Business Leaders” in the country.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from the responsibility of OUAEEC, Alexander is also the 
				chairman of the board of directors of Indian Schools in Oman, 
				where he has been instrumental in guiding the board to strike a 
				balance between the aspirations of the students and parents and 
				the school management. Whenever, Alexander has spare time, he 
				spends it with his family. He is also a voracious reader having 
				consumed books on religion, philosophy, business and biographies 
				depending upon his mood.&#8194;</td>

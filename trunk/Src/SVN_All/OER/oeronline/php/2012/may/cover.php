				<img border="0" src="images/cover-may-12-1.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #808080;" class="style17" width="326" height="301"></font><p align="justify" class="style13" dir="ltr">
				The year 2011 was an eventful year of enormous proportions. The 
				volatility during the year continued unabated due to several 
				factors including natural disasters, political upheaval and 
				financial turmoil. For the first time in history, we saw a 
				credit downgrade for the US as well as the deficit ceiling 
				fiasco, which brought the US to almost a financial standstill. 
				The earthquake and tsunami in Japan, took a devastating human 
				and economic toll. The debt crisis in Europe created fears of 
				sovereign defaults, resulting in major financing strains on 
				banks with fears of a breakup of the euro zone. With this 
				background, almost $6.3tn was wiped out from global stock 
				markets in 2011 with the global stock market capitalisation 
				dropping 12.1 per cent to $45.7trn according to Bloomberg data, 
				primarily in the European and the emerging markets. Oil prices 
				shot up to $114 a barrel before plunging to $76 and rising again 
				to $100 in reaction to the Arab spring in the Middle East and 
				North Africa. Gold broke through $1,890 an ounce, and the price 
				of Treasuries soared, with the yields on 10-year notes falling 
				nearly 40 per cent in the third quarter, to 1.9 per cent from 
				3.16 percent, despite the downgrade in America’s debt. <br>
				<br>
				As stated by HE Darwish bin Ismail Al Balushi, Minister 
				Responsible for Financial Affairs, in his budget speech, the 
				national economy continued, in the year 2011, its good 
				performance in spite of the severity of the international 
				financial and economic crisis that affected most of the advanced 
				economies. This strong performance is attributed to the increase 
				in the rates of the oil production, the remarkable improvement 
				in its prices and the expansionary fiscal and monetary policies 
				adopted by the government.<br>
				<br>
				The price of Oman crude oil continued to increase substantially 
				during the year 2011. Oman crude realised an average price of 
				$102.95 per barrel, compared with an average price of $76.64 for 
				2010 and the budgeted price of $58 per barrel for 2011. This has 
				resulted in Oman’s budget balance turning into a huge surplus of 
				RO964.8mn in 2011. <br>
				<br>
				For the year 2011, the MSM Index declined by 15.69 per cent, 
				compared to an increase of 6.06 per cent in the previous year. 
				The financial sector was the largest loser at 23.25 per cent for 
				the year 2011. The industrial sector was next which depreciated 
				by 18.45 per cent for the year. The services sector closed the 
				year with a total loss of 5.12 per cent. A total of 2.4 billion 
				shares got traded during the year amounting to an aggregate 
				turnover of RO992mn, which was down by 25 per cent compared to 
				2010. The MSM 30 Index hit a low of 5,419 points during the year 
				while the high of the year was 7,027 points closing the year at 
				5,695.12. With a return of 15.69 per cent for the year, the MSM 
				has been the fourth best performing market in the GCC region 
				behind Qatar, which advanced by 1.1 per cent and Saudi Arabia, 
				which declined by 3.1 per cent for the year. Abu Dhabi ended 
				third with a decline of 11.7 per cent, Kuwait 16.4 per cent, 
				Dubai 17 per cent, and Bahrain ended the year down by 22.2 per 
				cent. <br>
				<br>
				The substantial increase in oil prices during the year was 
				supported by increased oil production and increased non-oil 
				exports which resulted in a real GDP growth rate for 2011 of 7 
				per cent. Oil production increased in 2011 again by about 3 per 
				cent to 890,000 barrels per day. The government’s continued 
				emphasis on diversifying the economy away from dependence on oil 
				gained further momentum during 2011. Non-oil exports grew by 
				about 20 per cent. ‘MEED Projects’ estimates that there are 
				currently projects worth over RO5bn planned for Oman in a broad 
				range of sectors that include transport, petrochemicals and 
				utilities. The government launched several major projects for 
				construction of roads. Other major projects will be awarded in 
				the course of the year 2012.<br>
				<br>
				Performance of world financial markets was mixed. The S&amp;P 500 
				was flat in 2011 while the FTSE 100 only dropped by 5.5 per 
				cent. Eurofirst 300 gauge of blue-chip European companies lost 
				by 11 per cent, led by the French and Italian exchanges. The 
				MSCI Emerging Markets index has shed 20 per cent of its value 
				despite strong growth in China and other emerging markets. 
				Japan’s Nikkei index lost by 17.3 per cent this year, Hong 
				Kong’s Hang Seng index by 20 per cent and the Shanghai Composite 
				by 22 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				During the year 2011, the revenues of Oman’s 20 largest 
				companies showed an increase of RO365mn. Total revenues for the 
				OER Top 20 companies increased by 10.79 per cent to RO3,751mn. 
				Corporate performance for the year 2011, overall, however 
				decreased. The profits for the year 2011 decreased by 5 per cent 
				to RO447mn from RO471mn last year. The total market cap of the 
				OER Top 20 companies on December 31, 2011 was RO4,684mn, with a 
				decrease of 16 per cent compared to 2010. On March 31, 2011, the 
				market cap of the Top 20 has gone down by a further 7 per cent 
				to RO4,339 mn. The OER Top 2o companies represent 69.75 per cent 
				of the total market cap of the MSM-RO6,221mn at the end of 2011. 
				The average P/E ratio of the OER Top 20 based on the profits of 
				the year 2010 and the share price on 31 March 2011 is 9.7 times 
				earnings.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Who is out and who is in<br>
				</b>We have two new comers on the list this year. SMN Power, a 
				newcomer in the market by virtue of an IPO in 2011 comes in at 
				number 16 and Oman Refreshment at number 20.<br>
				<br>
				These companies have made it to the OER Top 20 this year at the 
				expense of Dhofar Power, which was delisted in 2011, and Salalah 
				Port.<br>
				<br>
				The ranking of Oman’s 20 largest companies in order of revenue 
				produces a list, which includes the six companies from the 
				financial sector, seven from the services sector and seven from 
				the industrial sector.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Largest Revenue<br>
				</b>Omantel continues to be the largest public company in Oman 
				with a growth in revenue of 8.64 per cent compared to 2010. Bank 
				Muscat has moved up one notch to number two with a growth in 
				revenue of 4.41 per cent. Shell has also moved up from four to 
				three with a growth of 10.88 per cent. Galfar Engineering has 
				fallen two places from being number two last year to number four 
				this year with a drop of revenue by 17.31 per cent. Renaissance 
				remains in the number five slot with an impressive growth in 
				revenue of 14.4 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				The chairman of Omantel HE Sultan bin Hamdoon Al Harthi in his 
				report to the shareholders explains that the total revenue 
				increased by 8.6 per cent. The increase is contributed by all 
				business segments--fixed, mobile and wholesale-- as well as 
				revenues from submarine capacity sales. He further explains that 
				the total operating expenses increased by 11.1 per cent. Major 
				reasons for the increase were costs related to capacity sale 
				from EIG / Falcon cable systems, increase in depreciation and 
				employee costs. Al Harthi states that the group has achieved a 
				net profit after tax of RO112.9mn compared to the net profit of 
				RO110.3mn in 2010, with an increase of 2.3 per cent. HE Al 
				Harthi adds that the total subscriber base has recorded a growth 
				of 6 per cent. The total number of subscribers has increased to 
				3.53mn compared to 3.33mn last year.<br>
				<br>
				HE Al Harthi states the telecom sector in Oman is likely to 
				experience intense competition in Year 2012. The company has 
				already withstood the competition successfully and with 
				integrated operating structure, it is well positioned to face 
				evolving competition. HE Al Harthi is hopeful that Omantel would 
				continue this performance in spite of increasing competitive 
				pressure.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Most profitable<br>
				</b>Three of the top five most profitable companies in Oman are 
				the same as last year with two newcomers on the list being 
				National Bank of Oman and Ominvest at the expense of BankDhofar 
				and Renaissance Services. BankMuscat has overtaken Omantel as 
				the most profitable company in 2011. Omantel has dropped one 
				place to the number two position. Oman Qatari Telecom retains 
				its third position as last year. The two newcomers on the list, 
				NBO and Ominvest, take the fourth and fifth positions.<br>
				<br>
				BankMuscat is the most profitable company in Oman as well as the 
				second largest company in Oman based on turnover for the year 
				2011. BankMuscat which was number two last year and has improved 
				this position from last year, has recorded a growth in profit 
				for the year of about 15.7 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				Chairman Khalid bin Mustahail Al Mashani states in his yearend 
				report to the shareholders that the results achieved have been 
				encouraging despite the challenging global economic and 
				financial situation. The key business lines of the bank recorded 
				healthy performance on expected lines. He explains that the bank 
				achieved a net profit of RO117.5mn as against a net profit of 
				RO101.6mn in 2010, an increase of 15.6 per cent over the year 
				2010.<br>
				<br>
				Mashani adds that during 2011, the return on average assets was 
				at 1.8 per cent compared to 1.7 per cent in 2010. The return on 
				average equity was 15.4 per cent in 2011 compared to 14.6 per 
				cent in 2010 and the basic earnings per share was RO0.076 as 
				against RO0.075 in 2010.<br>
				<br>
				Mashani goes on to say that the board has proposed a dividend of 
				40 per cent, 25 per cent in the form of cash and 15 per cent in 
				the form of stock.<br>
				<br>
				Mashani observes that the overall economic outlook for 2012 
				remains positive with the government announcing a 12 per cent 
				increase in spending. Indications are that infrastructure 
				projects will continue to give a fillip to the economy in 2012.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Profit growth<br>
				</b>SMN Power Holding has shown the highest growth in profits by 
				an enormous 222.35 per cent and comes in straight at the number 
				one spot. All the five top companies showing the highest growth 
				of profit – SMN Power, Oman Refreshment, Al Jazeera Steel, Bank 
				Sohar and Al Maha Petroleum – are new in the list. OHI, Galfar, 
				BankMuscat, BankDhofar and NBO which were in this list last year 
				have all dropped off.<br>
				<br>
				The chairman of SMN Power Holding Mahinder Nath in his report to 
				the shareholders for the year ended on December 31, 2011 has 
				explained that the company and its affiliates cater to around 35 
				per cent of the total power capacity and 20 per cent of the 
				water capacity of Oman. He adds that in 2011 the company reached 
				an important milestone by successfully listing 35 per cent of 
				its issued share capital on the Muscat Securities Market. He 
				explains that the technical performances of the plants over 2011 
				were in line with expectations. Nath adds that the technical 
				performance of the plants is reflected in the financial 
				statements with net earnings per share increasing to RO0.192 
				compared to RO0.060 in 2010 in line with forecast. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Highest capitalised<br>
				</b>Three of the top five companies that have the highest amount 
				of equity employed are banks. Four of the five companies in this 
				category remain the same as last year and in exactly the same 
				positions. The newcomer in the list at number five is Oman 
				Qatari Telecom who has replaced Renaissance Services.<br>
				<br>
				The chairman of NBO, Omar Al Fardan, in his report to the 
				shareholders states that the bank achieved a net profit of 
				RO34.2mn for the year compared to RO27.2mn for 2010, an increase 
				of 26 per cent. Al Fardan remarks that the net spreads went to 
				3.18 per cent in 2011. The cost to income ratio improved from 51 
				per cent to 47 per cent on a year on year basis due to higher 
				levels of income. The bank continues to reduce non-performing 
				loans, with the non-performing loan ratio standing at 2.9 per 
				cent at the end of December 2011 as compared to 3.5 per cent in 
				2010. Al Fardan adds that the board has recommended a cash 
				dividend of RO0.0175 per share as well as a stock dividend of 
				0.0025 per share this year based on the dividend policy approved 
				by the board of directors.<br>
				<br>
				Al Fardan states that the bank looks at 2012 with optimism as 
				continued government spending is expected to maintain the growth 
				momentum. Participation in major domestic transactions and cross 
				border activity in conjunction with its strategic alliance 
				partner, Commercial Bank of Qatar, continues to be the key to 
				driving efficiencies by sharing best practices. He also adds 
				that the bank plans to offer Islamic banking in 2012 as part of 
				their franchise following the recent approval by the Central 
				Bank of Oman for introducing Islamic banking in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Market capitalisation<br>
				</b>This year again, two of the top five companies that have the 
				highest market capitalisation on the MSM are not banks. Omantel 
				and Bank Muscat have once again swapped places this year with 
				the former emerging as the number one company on the MSM in 
				terms of market cap. Bank Dhofar, Oman Qatari Telecom and NBO 
				retain their same positions as last year.<br>
				<br>
				The chairman of Bank Dhofar, Abdul Hafidh Salim Rajab Al Aujaili 
				in his annual report to the shareholders states that the bank’s 
				winning streak continued in 2011 as it was awarded ‘Best Bank in 
				Oman’ twice in a row by the OER-GBCM Best Banks in Oman Survey 
				and therefore it seeks to concentrate on development from all 
				aspects.<br>
				<br>
				Al Aujaili explains that the profit before tax for the year 2011 
				achieved by the bank, after the legal case loss charge off and 
				other recoveries, was RO15.9mn in the year 2011, and the same, 
				excluding the effect of legal case loss of RO26.1mn, would have 
				been RO42mn as compared to RO37.9mn achieved in the previous 
				year 2010 recording a growth of 10.8 per cent. The net profit 
				after tax is RO14mn for the year 2011 as compared to RO33.3mn 
				achieved during 2010, showing a decline of 58 per cent. In the 
				light of these results, the board of directors has proposed a 
				cash dividend of 7 per cent and a bonus share issue of 20.2 per 
				cent.<br>
				<br>
				Al Aujaili explains that a lawsuit was filed by Oman 
				International Bank against Ali Redha Al Lawati and his companies 
				(Ali Redha Trading and Muttrah Holding) and Bank Dhofar as per 
				the Enforcement Court’s order which instructed BankDhofar to 
				transfer an amount of RO26.1mn to the Court’s account. The case 
				relates back to a dispute between Oman International Bank and 
				Ali Redha Group, who purported to have owned and pledged 
				1,925,000 shares of BankDhofar in favour of Oman International 
				Bank, and the same is disputed by BankDhofar.<br>
				<br>
				Al Aujaili states that in its continuous efforts to improve the 
				performance of the bank, the board of directors has appointed a 
				consultancy firm, Boston Consulting group, to formulate a 
				five-year strategic plan for the bank and supervise its 
				implementation.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Returns on equity<br>
				</b>Interestingly, none of the top five companies showing the 
				best return on equity employed come from the banking sector. 
				Three of the companies in the top five are newcomers to the 
				list. Shell remains at the number one spot as last year. Oman 
				Refreshment, a newcomer to the list, comes straight in at the 
				number two spot. Oman Qatari Telecom slips to the number three 
				positions. Newcomers Oman Oil and Al Maha Petroleum take the 
				number four and five positions. Ominvest, Omantel and OHI are 
				knocked out of this list.<br>
				<br>
				Amjad Mohamed Al Busaidi, Chairman of Oman Qatari 
				Telecommunications Company (Nawras) in his annual report to the 
				shareholders for the year ended 2011 states that in the first 
				full year as a public company, revenue increased by 4.2 per cent 
				to RO196.9mn yielding a net profit of RO47.5mn. Earnings per 
				share equated to RO0.073. Al Busaidi explains that taking the 
				year’s achievements into account, Nawras has maintained compound 
				annual growth rate of 54 per cent in revenue since its 
				formation. This enables the board to recommend to the 
				shareholders a dividend of RO0.38 per share representing a yield 
				of 5.8 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				Al Busaidi adds that their investment in technology and physical 
				assets has been completed by corresponding emphasis on 
				developing human capital. Nawras has always been a ‘people 
				company’ and this outstanding feature becomes more evident by 
				the year, he adds.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Earnings per share growth<br>
				</b>Four of the top five earnings per share growth companies are 
				newcomers in this list. SMN Power jumps straight into number one 
				spot. Oman Refreshment comes in at the number two position, Al 
				Jazeera Steel at number three, Bank Sohar at number four and NBO, 
				which was number four last year, at number five. OHI, Galfar, 
				BankDhofar, and Salalah Port who were on this list in 2010 have 
				all disappeared.<br>
				<br>
				Buti Obaid al Mulla, chairman of Oman Refreshment, in his report 
				to the shareholders states that while the food and beverages 
				market in Oman continues to grow with the growth of local 
				population and influx of expatriate manpower required for the 
				growing economy, the operational environment poses some 
				challenges such as the changing consumption habits, stiff 
				competition in juice, water and snacks product segments in a 
				highly price sensitive local market. Also, the operating margins 
				are subject to tremendous pressure due to rising cost of input 
				materials and employment. The commodity prices in the 
				international markets are on continuous rise on account of a 
				series of natural calamities resulting in food shortages in many 
				parts of the world. Al Mulla explains that the company has 
				achieved a net profit after tax of RO7.04mn on a total turnover 
				of RO56.04mn for the year 2011 compared to a net profit after 
				tax of RO3.35mn on a turnover of RO45.11mn in 2010. The overall 
				revenue has increased by 24 per cent as the company’s efforts to 
				improve sales realisation have succeeded during the year which, 
				together with the efficiencies resulting out of various cost 
				control and costs optimisation measures, despite the challenges 
				of rising costs of employment and high staff turnover due to the 
				recent changes in the employment market, have contributed to 
				overall growth in the top line as well as bottom line. Al Mulla 
				adds that in view of good performance of the company during 
				2011, the board is pleased to recommend a cash dividend of 70 
				per cent (70 Baizas for each paid up share) of the issued share 
				capital for the year 2011.<br>
				<br>
				Al Mulla is optimistic about the future prospects with the 
				product expansion and diversification plans and renewed impetus 
				on achieving higher production efficiencies. However, the 
				volatile global market of commodities and the rising prices of 
				key input raw materials, packing materials and volatile 
				employment market may impact profitability of the company in the 
				near future.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Share price growth<br>
				</b>Three of the five companies in this list are new comers. 
				Oman Refreshment comes in straight into the number one position 
				with a massive share price growth of 71.88 per cent. Oman Oil 
				Marketing retains its second position same as 2010. Newcomer Al 
				Maha Petroleum comes in at number three. Shell moves up one 
				place to number four and newcomer Omantel comes in at the number 
				five position. Renaissance, Al Hassan engineering and BankMuscat 
				who were on the list last year have all dropped out.<br>
				<br>
				Salim Abdullah Al Rawas, chairman of Oman Oil Marketing in his 
				report to the shareholders states that in 2011, the company 
				committed itself to pursuing an aggressive growth target, with 
				the ultimate intention of leading the domestic market in all its 
				business sectors. The company recorded its highest total sales 
				in history of approximately RO278.2mn, with an increase of 29 
				per cent compared to RO216.2mn in 2010. The pre-tax profit 
				increased by 18 per cent to RO9.2mn from RO7.8mn. After 
				providing for corporate tax, the company’s net profit amounted 
				to RO8.1mn, the highest ever net profit in the company’s 
				history, a 17 per cent increase from that of 2012. Earnings per 
				share stood at 126 baizas. Al Rawas adds that the board of 
				directors is recommending a final dividend of approximately 62 
				baisas per share which represents 62 per cent of nominal value 
				per share. Al Rawas explains that the company has continued to 
				increase its presence nationwide with a network of 132 stations 
				offering the company’s full array of petroleum products. The 
				retail business continues to be the back bone of the company.<br>
				<br>
				Al Rawas is positive on the outlook for the coming year with the 
				demand for petroleum products expected to grow in line with 
				Oman’s projected economic growth of approximately 7 per cent in 
				2012. He explains that the company is gearing itself for intense 
				competition particularly in retail and commercial businesses. 
				Current market share is to be defended while new ones are to be 
				created and the margins to be managed.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Dividend yield<br>
				</b>One new company has entered the ranking of the best five 
				dividend yield companies. Areej Vegetable Oils continues to

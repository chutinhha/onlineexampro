						Oman Green Award (OGA), Oman’s first environmental award 
						to honour outstanding environmental vision, endeavours 
						and achievements of corporates and individuals, has 
						launched an initiative for paper recycling at various 
						schools in Muscat in association with Oman Marketing &amp; 
						Services Co (Omasco). As a build-up to the third edition 
						of OGA and in line with OGA’s plans to inculcate 
						awareness about conservation and recycling in the 
						society, the initiative is aimed at making students and 
						teachers more conscious about the importance of 
						recycling and reusing papers. As the first step of the 
						initiative, around 30 recycle bins were placed at four 
						leading schools in the city to collect used papers from 
						the school premises and send them for recycling. The OGA 
						team visited Indian School Muscat, British School 
						Muscat, Indian School Al Ghubra and ABA-An IB World 
						School to hand over the recycle bins which were received 
						by the principals of the schools along with the 
						environment/eco club coordinators and students.<br>
						<br>
						They were all praise for the various initiatives by OGA 
						to spread the message of conservation and sustainability 
						in Omani society, and especially its attempt to reach 
						out to the students to make them work as the agents of 
						environmental change and contribute their shared vision 
						for a better future.<br>
						<br>
						Congratulating the OGA initiative, Kai Vacher, principal 
						of British School Muscat, said it would help generate 
						more awareness among the students about recycling and 
						reusing. “We are as a school very much committed to 
						recycling. Sustainability is integrated in the 
						curriculum of all students form both primary and senior 
						schools. There are active environmental teams such as 
						green team, recycling team and eco warriors. The 
						children are involved in community environmental 
						initiatives such as beach clean-ups, have links with 
						organisations outside of school like Oman Botanic 
						Gardens, ECOMAN and ESO and all classes currently 
						recycle paper and plastic containers.”<br>
						<br>
						Achuthan Madhav, principal of Indian School Muscat, said 
						the recycle bin presented by OGA will add value to 
						various green initiatives undertaken by the Eco and 
						Health Club in the school. Lalitha Mallya, coordinator 
						of Eco and Health Club, adds, “The activities of the 
						health and environment club can be summed up in its 
						three main objectives: clean school; green school and 
						healthy school. By clean school we mean the cleanliness 
						of the child, class room, corridor and the whole 
						surroundings; we developed the concept of green school 
						to set up gardens for school as well as for each class 
						room. In addition, as part of our healthy school 
						initiative, we make the students bring only Salads once 
						in a week.”<br>

						<br>
						Papri Ghosh, principal of Indian School Al Ghubrah, 
						praised the OGA initiative to spread awareness among 
						students about recycling. “Our school accords more 
						importance to making the student environmentally 
						conscious. The younger minds can produce fresh and 
						genuine ideas to make conservation more effective,” she 
						avers. Explaining the various activities undertaken by 
						the environment club of the school, its coordinator 
						Maleka Ariwala adds, “The motto of our environment club 
						is to recycle, reuse and rethink. From this year onwards 
						we stopped giving plastic bags while selling the books 
						and we asked the students not to cover their textbooks 
						and notebooks with plastic bags. As teachers we all make 
						the students believe that we have not inherited the 
						nature from our forefathers; but we have borrowed it 
						from our forefathers.”<br>
						<br>
						ABA-An IB World School which received 15 bins has a 
						total of 14 recycling facilities on its premises, each 
						with specific bins for paper, plastic bottles, aluminum 
						cans, batteries etc. “We have been involved in recycling 
						for many years now and will continue to do that in the 
						future,” says Terry Storer, principal of the school. The 
						school also has an environmental club.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Into the third edition<br>
						</b>Oman Green Awards is the ultimate recognition for 
						companies, institutions and individuals in Oman, who 
						demonstrate a commitment towards responsible consumption 
						and sustainable growth. The award honours and celebrates 
						their vision in leading the way to a cleaner, greener 
						tomorrow. The last two editions of the OGA were a 
						resounding success in meeting its stated objectives. The 
						OGA has invited entries for the third edition of the 
						awards which will be announced on June 5, 2012. It is a 
						unique opportunity to be part of a national platform to 
						honour and appreciate outstanding environmental vision, 
						endeavors, initiatives and achievements in the country. 
						The nomination form must be completed and submitted

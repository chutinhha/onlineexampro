				As part of the internal restructuring to enhance cost and 
				service efficiency, Oman Telecommunications Company embarked 
				upon an integrated operating model merging its fixed (Omantel) 
				and mobile (Oman Mobile) operations. The formal merger has been 
				completed and as of January 1, 2012 both companies became 
				legally one company under Omantel.<br>
				<br>
				As the leading telecom operator in Oman, the strategy of the 
				company remains centered on expanding the promising segments of 
				the market and to develop attractive offerings with a particular 
				focus on broadband solutions in order to fulfill increasing 
				demand created by the rise of smart devices and social networks.
				<br>
				<br>
				The mobile segment has been the primary growth driver of Omantel 
				revenues over the past three years. Total revenues comprising 
				revenues from fixed line, internet and data, mobile services and 
				in-payment and interconnection services have increased from 
				RO416.6mn in 2010 to RO452.6mn in 2011 with an y-o-y growth of 
				8.6 per cent. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Milestones<br>
				</b>Overall retail mobile revenues recorded a growth of 9.4 per 
				cent over year 2010<br>
				Aggregate internet and data communications revenues in 2011 
				witnessed a growth of around 18.4 per cent over 2010, mainly 
				driven by broadband and data services<br>
				Overall revenue from internet services increased in 2011 mainly 
				due to enhanced broadband offers implemented effective from 
				January 2011<br>
				Mobile subscriber base reached 2.277 million, a net increase of 
				144,000 (excluding mobile resellers)<br>
				The broadband market has seen significant uplift in 2011 mainly 
				driven by mobile broadband services growth of 139 per cent y-o-y<br>
				<br>
				<b>Outlook<br>
				</b>Omantel expects that the growth momentum would continue to 
				be driven by the mobile market (broadband). In addition, the 
				trend in the fixed broadband growth witnessed in 2011 is 
				expected to continue due to innovative offers.<br>
				<br>
				The state budget which projected a GDP growth of 7 per cent with 
				increased expenditure outlay for social, health, education 
				sector and commitment of over 36,000 new jobs for nationals is 
				also expected to provide the necessary stimulus to the telecom 
				sector notwithstanding the challenges posed by the increasing 
				competition.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Quote:</b><br>
				“Mobile market witnessed renewed growth in 2011 mainly driven by 
				the broadband market. We expect that the momentum would continue 
				with increased penetration of lower end of smart phones coupled 
				with flexible and innovative offers”<br>

				Best in class</b><br>
				<br>
				In the era of global financial mess, BankMuscat stands tall with 
				a stress on fundamentals<br>
				<br>
				BankMuscat achieved a net profit of RO117.5mn for the year ended 
				on December 2011 as against a net profit of RO101.6mn in 2010, 
				an increase of 15.7 per cent. Net interest income increased by 
				13.3 per cent to RO212.1mn in 2011 from RO187.2mn reported 
				during the year 2010. Increase in net interest income is 
				attributable to improvement in net interest margin and asset 
				growth.<br>
				Net loans and advances increased by 20.2 per cent to RO4.82bn as 
				against RO4.01bn as at December 31, 2010. Customer deposits 
				including CDs increased by 31.8 per cent to RO4.6bn as against 
				RO3.7bn in 2010. <br>
				For the year 2011, the bank’s board of directors proposed a 
				dividend of 40 per cent – 25 per cent in the form of cash and 15 
				per cent in the form of bonus shares. Thus cash dividend would 
				be 25 baiza per 100 baiza share aggregating to RO38.7mn while 
				the bonus shares would be in the proportion of one share for 
				every 6.666 ordinary shares aggregating to 232,256,957 shares of 
				100 baiza each amounting to RO23.2mn.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Milestones</b><br>
				The bank marked its foray into Southeast Asia with a 
				representative office in Singapore<br>
				Al Mazyona, the bank’s savings scheme, crossed the RO1bn mark in 
				deposits<br>
				<br>
				Facilitated the closure of financing of $562mn PET and APETR 
				sheet project of OCTAL Petrochemicals<br>
				<br>
				With a brand value of $300mn, BankMuscat was ranked among the 
				top 500 global banking brands by the Banker magazine<br>
				<br>
				The bank achieved a global first of winning the prestigious 
				Level 3 People Capability Maturity Model (PCMM) certification 
				for its human resources process improvements<br>
				<br>
				BankMuscat made it to the first ever ranking of the 50 Safest 
				Banks in Emerging Markets by Global Finance<br>
				<br>
				The bank has announced ‘Meethaq’ Islamic banking window 
				operations with a capital of RO150mn, subject to approval of the 
				Central Bank of Oman<br>
				<br>
				<b>Outlook</b><br>
				BankMuscat expects to benefit from the government’s policy aimed 
				at balancing the economic and social development as some 45,000 
				new positions will be created for Omanis each year. The launch 
				of its Islamic banking division will also contribute to the 
				bank’s performance. The bank also expects a fiscal surplus in 
				2012 on the back of supportive oil prices. Indications are that 
				the infrastructure projects will continue to give a fillip to 
				the economy in 2012 as part of the 8th Five-Year Plan strategy<br>
				<br>
				<b>Quote:</b><br>
				“Strong customer relationship remains fundamental to the growth 
				of our corporate business with a focus on the quality of loan 
				assets and building customer confidence. The bank maintains its 
				emphasis in supporting feasible projects in core areas such as 
				oil and gas, petrochemicals, large-scale industry, shipping and

				Retaining its success</b><br>
				<br>
				Maintaining a profitable footprint in both new and existing 
				contracts was the name of the game<br>
				<br>
				Shell Oman Marketing Company embarked on a major transformation 
				and business process re-engineering programme in 2010 which 
				continued through 2011 and concluded in the first quarter of 
				2012. This has enabled the company to be well prepared for the 
				future in terms of growth, customer value proposition, internal 
				efficiency and operational excellence. The plan includes a major 
				revision of its end-to-end business processes and implementation 
				of a new integrated SAP application platform.<br>
				The company’s performance was affected by unrest in the Middle 
				East and North Africa. Particularly the lubricant export 
				business was adversely impacted as there was reduced offtake 
				from the customers in these regions.<br>
				However, the retail business, the largest portfolio segment, saw 
				an increase in sales volume higher than the previous year. The 
				commercial fuels business came under intense competitive 
				pressure, resulting in decisions to allow certain contracts to 
				move to competitors. <br>
				While the lubricants business managed to retain its contracts as 
				well, the marine business grew steadily. The bitumen business 
				also developed new capabilities and brought new technologies to 
				Oman.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Milestones</b><br>
				The transformation and business process re-engineering programme 
				which began in 2010 went live on January 1, 2012<br>
				<br>
				The company received a letter of intent from Oman Air to supply 
				50 per cent of Oman Air’s total fuel uplift at Muscat 
				International Airport subject to the signing of a final contract<br>
				<br>
				Retail sites achieved a new record of 144 sites in total with 
				the opening of four sites. In addition two sites were rebuilt<br>
				<br>
				New business won from Arab Airlines members group for one year 
				with a two-year extension of its exclusive operating concession 
				at Salalah Airport<br>
				<br>
				Total number of staff rises to 296 following recruitment of more 
				local talent<br>
				Shell Select stores had a 60 per cent y-o-y growth<br>
				<br>
				<b>Outlook</b><br>
				The government’s latest Five-Year development plan provides 
				strong infrastructure development and creates expected growth in 
				the retail market above the GDP. As such the key focus areas for 
				2012 in the retail segment will be to increase the network roll 
				out, increasing the cards business, operational excellence and 
				innovative marketing campaigns.<br>

				<br>
				Galfar Engineering and Contracting Co continues to be one of the 
				largest multidisciplinary engineering and contracting company in 
				the Sultanate, despite the entry of various new players in the 
				market. The company has developed the capacity and capability to 
				execute the most challenging jobs in the various streams of 
				infrastructure development; and its experience in the three 
				major construction and infrastructure sectors oil &amp; gas, roads, 
				bridges and airports; and civil and utilities, remains 
				unparalleled.<br>
				<br>
				Human resources has been one of the main pillars in enhancing 
				the performance of the company. The company employs over 20,000 
				employees at site, across various functions and levels and is 
				one of the largest employers of Omani workforce in the private 
				sector.<br>
				<br>
				In order to maintain its competitive edge in the oil &amp; gas 
				industry, Galfar remodeled its quality management system to 
				comply with the requirements of ISO 29001:2010 (petroleum and 
				petrochemical sector specific standard).<br>

				<b>Outlook</b><br>
				The company’s order book position is healthy and it is confident 
				of doing large volume of jobs during the forthcoming years and 
				focus on its growth plans. The appreciably healthy order book 
				during the beginning of the year is indicative of further 
				significant order booking prospects and the company is confident 
				about acquiring a number of significant contracts this year.<br>
				<br>
				The Indian operations of Galfar created significant value and is 
				expected to remain a key growth area as the demand for roads and 
				highways is phenomenal. The company is also looking at Saudi 
				Arabia, where substantial opportunities are available. As a 
				first step towards this, the company recently registered a

				INTEGRITY IN ADVERSITY</b><br>
				<br>
				Renaissance Services is working tirelessly on exceeding 
				shareholder expectations with a renewed performance and stress 
				on its fundamental values<br>
				<br>
				Renaissance Services faced unforeseen and unprecedented 
				challenges in 2011 after 10 successive years of growth and 
				record results. But the company regards the downturn in its 2011 
				performance as having been contained and reversed. <br>
				<br>
				Stakeholders trust Renaissance companies to exceed customer 
				expectations safely and efficiently. The company ended the year 
				with RO653.7mn of assets and more than RO37mn of cash on its 
				balance sheet. It invested RO90.4mn in new assets for growth 
				during 2011. The result is a 14.4 per cent growth in revenue in 
				2011.<br>
				<br>
				During the past year, the engineering business parted into two 
				distinct divisions: Oil &amp; Gas Engineering and Marine 
				Engineering. The Marine And Contract Services businesses of the 
				company continue to perform well. The company has been 
				restructured and streamlined. Renaissance predicts the 
				continuing muted performance to last only till the first half of 
				2012, improving strongly in the second half of the year.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Milestones</b><br>
				Contract Services team had employed a net increase of 786 Omanis 
				in the year, raising the total number of Omanis employed to 
				2,200<br>

				<br>
				In Azerbaijan, four new vessels joined the fleet in 2011<br>
				Successful entry into new markets in West Africa and Saudi 
				Arabia<br>
				<br>
				<b>Outlook</b><br>
				Even with uncertainty in the global economy, industry and market 
				trends look positive for Renaissance businesses. Barclays 
				Capital estimates that global exploration and production (E&amp;P) 
				spending in 2012 will be up by 10 per cent with Middle East E&amp;P 
				spending expected to rise 12 per cent due to a pickup in 
				activity particularly in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
				Renaissance believes that this is good news for all its 
				businesses.<br>
				<br>
				Renaissance is committed to promoting sustainable economic 
				development and to collaborate with employees, their families 
				and the local community and society at large to help foster a 
				better quality of life. This year, the company has incorporated 
				Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 3.0) disclosure parameters for

				their market share. <br>
				<br>
				The commercial team is focused on obtaining new infrastructure 
				contracts as announced by the government and private sectors. 
				This will contribute positively as the construction of various

				Excellent performance</b><br>
				<br>
				The market share of Al Maha is quite healthy and is expected be 
				sustained and maintained<br>
				<br>
				Taking advantage of the favourable economic situation, Al Maha 
				Petroleum Products Marketing Co achieved a record growth in 
				sales which reached RO268.3mn in 2011, an increase of 22 per 
				cent (RO48.5mn) compared to 2010. The net profit of the company 
				was RO8.6mn, an increase of 28 per cent (RO1.9mn) over 2010.<br>
				<br>
				Retail sales continued to be the main contributor to the 
				company’s revenue stream with sales increasing by 17 per cent 
				compared to 2010. This was largely attributable to the increase 
				in sales volume which crossed the one billion litres mark in 
				2011.<br>
				<br>
				The retail sales segment witnessed further growth and saw the 
				total number of filling stations climb to 171. With the 
				launching of the re-branding project, a total of 10 filling 
				stations have been completed adding a new dimension to the 
				outlook of Al Maha filling stations. The commercial sales 
				segment also recorded an impressive growth of 20 per cent in 
				2011. This has been attributed to the increased demand for 
				diesel by Al Maha customers on account of execution of some 
				major infrastructural projects.<br>
				<br>
				The aviation and lubricants sales saw significant rises mainly 
				due to an increased supply to Oman Air and other airlines. The 
				significant increase in international selling prices of aviation 
				fuel has also increased aviation sales. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Milestones</b><br>
				Successfully achieved ‘Lost Time Injury Free and Fatality-Free’ 
				in 2011<br>
				Four new filling stations were opened in 2011<br>
				Two more car wash centres were commissioned <br>
				Aviation sales rose by 48 per cent<br>
				Omanisation level reached 88 per cent at the end of 2011 with 
				total employees standing at 161<br>
				<br>
				<b>Outlook</b><br>
				Al Maha expects to sustain its future growth and improve demand 
				for its fuel products across various business segments as a 
				result of the large public infrastructure investment programme 
				by the government which is underway, namely rail network, new 
				air and sea ports, power and tourism projects.<br>
				<br>
				The company’s main emphasis would be on infrastructural 
				improvement to provide better customer care in order to increase 
				its market share.<br>

				Seven years young </b><br>
				<br>
				Nawras has been a ‘people company’ and this feature becomes more 
				evident as the days go by<br>
				<br>
				The Omani Qatari Telecommunications Company (Nawras) in its 
				first full year as a public company saw its gross consolidated 
				revenue increase by 4.2 per cent to RO196.9mn as compared to 
				RO189mn in 2010, yielding a net profit of RO47.5mn after 
				taxation.<br>
				<br>
				The year’s achievements are the fruits of a well-established 
				business strategy that has shaped the company’s success over its 
				seven-year existence. Nawras invested heavily in creating the 
				physical structure necessary to bring the best of modern 
				telecommunications technology to the people of Oman, wherever 
				they live or work. <br>
				<br>
				Nawras investments in technology and physical assets have been 
				complemented by corresponding emphasis on developing its human 
				capital. Nawras has always been a ‘people company’ and this 
				outstanding feature becomes more evident by the year. Its 
				employees, distributors and retailers, customers, and suppliers 
				all comprise the extended Nawras family. And it treats each 
				other with the respect that family members deserve.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Milestones</b><br>
				Increased its workforce to over 1,000 including the addition of 
				150 new positions for Omanis at the request of the government of 
				Oman<br>
				Broadband traffic increased from one terabyte a day to 18 
				terabytes a day in 2011<br>
				Prepaid customers exceeded 1.75 million and the number of home 
				broadband and voice customers increased by 251 per cent to 
				27,000<br>
				Sales network expanded, ending 2011 with six distributors, 26 
				Nawras stores, 107 premium dealers, over 1,000 standard dealers 
				and 15,000 recharge outlets<br>

				<br>
				<b>Outlook</b><br>
				Looking ahead, Nawras aims to build on the proven principles 
				that have served it so well to date. In broad terms, the company 
				wants to grow its mobile revenues faster than the market, 
				develop new revenue streams, and maintain its focus on 
				cost-efficiency. As its intensive capital expenditure programme 
				matures, Nawras will benefit from overall cost reduction and 
				growth in its fixed-line and mobile business. The company also 
				has the opportunity to win a significant share of the growing 
				market for broadband and at the same time, it can take a greater 
				share of international carrier business, while selling spare 
				capacity to other network providers and service operators.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Quote:</b><br>
				“Although the company will undoubtedly face market competition, 
				it has the benefits of a stable and prosperous economic 
				environment coupled together with its proven record of 
				consistent performance and achievement over the past seven 
				years”<br>

				<br>
				Opening the conference, Bocar A Ba, president of SAMENA

				accompanied by a major shift towards digitisation which entails 
				and accentuates the need for organised policies both at the

				<br>
				The telecommunications sector in Oman has reached a level of 
				maturity where it requires less regulation from the 
				Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) and is governed 
				more by customer demand, according to Omantel CEO Dr Amer al 
				Rawas. According to Ross Cormack, chief executive of Nawras, 
				“Mega mergers in last few years by regional powerhouses have 
				emphasised on the role of total consolidation in order to drive 
				growth, as it focuses on and is driven by customers.”<br>

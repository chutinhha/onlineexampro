						<font face="Verdana" size="1">In their quest to move 
						away from predominantly oil-based economies, the GCC 
						nations initiated several big projects, with 
						construction being one of their top-most priorities in 
						the last decade. The GCC construction sector saw a 
						period of spectacular boom and was subsequently 
						adversely affected by the global economic meltdown. 
						Although the sector is showing signs of recovery, 
						investors are still taking a cautious approach. However, 
						the growth of the sector is supported by sound economic 
						fundamentals and healthy growth forecasts of the GCC 
						countries. With oil prices expected to be stable, any 
						further increases in government spending will support 
						investment and consumer spending, thereby having a 
						positive effect on GDP growth, which will bode well for 
						the overall economy in general and construction sector 
						in particular.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Outlook<br>
						</b>Although the construction and real estate sector has 
						started recovering from the lows of 2008-2009, growth is 
						still far from pre-crisis levels. The growth is also not 
						uniform across all regions within the GCC and while some 
						countries are leading the recovery; others continue to 
						take a more careful approach. Prospects in the Qatari 
						construction market are looking optimistic on the back 
						of strong GDP growth and the successful bid for the 2022 
						FIFA World Cup. In Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, the focus 
						of the residential construction sector has shifted to 
						providing affordable homes to the low and middle income 
						group of population. UAE’s reputation as a safe and 
						stable country amid the recent ‘Arab Spring’ is likely 
						to have a positive impact on the construction sector 
						despite the current oversupply and cautious approach to 
						new investments.<br>
						<br>
						GCC region continues to enjoy premium on rental yields 
						as compared to the mature markets of the US and Europe, 
						which will keep the overseas investors’ interest intact 
						in the sector. Due to low number of transactions taking 
						place in the marketplace, the determination of the price 
						ranges is a challenging task, thereby making this a 
						buyer’s market. We foresee continuation of this phase in 
						near to mid-term.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Residential construction market <br>
						</b>Oman’s construction and real estate market did not 
						witness the same boom as exhibited by other GCC member 
						countries mainly due to government regulations (non-GCC 
						nationals were not allowed to acquire freehold interest 
						in land till 2006). However, post 2006, when the 
						government introduced a change in law, allowing foreign 
						nationals’ ownership rights in land located in 
						designated Integrated Tourist Complexes (ITCs), the 
						residential construction and real estate market received 
						a big boost.<br>
						<br>
						Since the construction and real estate sector was not as 
						big as compared to other GCC member countries, the 
						global recession in 2008 did not have as severe an 
						impact on Oman as it did on some of its counterparts in 
						the GCC region. With an oversupply of residential units, 
						Oman’s residential construction and real estate market 
						underwent a correction and average lease rates in Muscat 
						dropped by nearly 13 per cent between 2009 and 20101.<br>
						<br>
						In the last few quarters, the lease rentals have shown 
						some signs of stabilisation. An improving private sector 
						is the primary driver for the recent growth in Oman’s 
						economy. The number of employees in the private sector 
						has grown by 20.7 per cent from 2008 to 2010 leading to 
						a surge in demand for properties2.<br>
						<br>
						The residential prices which fell significantly from 
						their peak in 2008 showed signs of stabilisation in 
						2011. We expect this trend to continue in future 
						(particularly in Muscat) on the back of a recovering 
						economy.<br>
						<br>
						We expect demand for residential properties to be strong 
						in the well developed localities of Qurum, Shatti Al 
						Qurum, Madinat Qaboos, The Wave and Muscat Hills.<br>
						<br>
						Over the long-term, we have an optimistic outlook on 
						residential construction markets on the back of 
						increasing population and rising employment levels.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Commercial construction market<br>
						</b>Oman is currently facing a steep fall in property 
						prices due to oversupply and muted demand. The 
						post-crisis period has been marked by declining office 
						prices, rentals, and high vacancy rates due to 
						oversupply of commercial properties. Currently, the 
						office vacancy rates in Oman stands at around 25 per 
						cent.<br>
						<br>
						In Muscat, stock of modern commercial office space has 
						increased drastically over the last few years on the 
						back of economic and demographic growth, government 
						diversification and privatisation initiatives. However, 
						Grade A buildings which meet the requirements of 
						multi-national companies still remain in short-supply. 
						This situation might change in the next one year with 
						the completion of several office buildings like Al Rawaq 
						Building in Qurum and Tilal Complex in Al Khuwair.<br>
						<br>
						Prime office rentals in Muscat fell by around 33 per 
						cent between Q3 2010 and Q2 20113. Rental yield from 
						property in Muscat stood at around 5.5 per cent gross 
						return to value. However, based on original purchase 
						price off plan, the properties rental yields stood at 
						around 10 per cent per annum4.<br>
						<br>
						The commercial office properties market will continue to 
						be marked by oversupply in the short to medium-term as 
						new supply enters the market. However, though the 
						overall commercial office properties market will remain 
						oversupplied, quality new office space in smaller 
						modular units will be in undersupply.<br>
						<br>
						Prices as well as rentals will continue their downward 
						spiral in the near-term. Due to lack of suitable office 
						space around Muscat, many companies are looking at the 
						option of constructing purpose-built offices, which may 
						result in further downward pressure on occupancy levels 
						and rentals in Muscat.<br>
						<br>
						Over the long-term, we have an optimistic outlook for 
						commercial office construction markets on the back of 
						increasing population and rising employment levels.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Free Zones in Oman<br>
						</b>Oman too has put emphasis on development of free 
						zones which is expected to act as a catalyst for 
						economic development, investment and providing 
						employment to Omani nationals. Currently, there are two 
						new free zones under development, namely Al Duqm Free 
						Trade Zone and Sohar Free Trade Zone. The Duqm Free 
						Trade Zone and Industrial Area is proposed to be housed 
						on a 24,000-hectare plot near Duqm port. The Sohar free 
						zone is being built on an area of 4,500 hectare and had 
						begun its first phase development in 2010. We expect the 
						completion of these Free Zones to boost demand for 
						commercial office space in Oman.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Key Growth Drivers<br>
						</b>Continued growth in global oil demand and an 
						increasing long-term trend in oil prices have given a 
						boost to GCC’s economy. With oil prices expected to be 
						stable, any further increases in government spending 
						will support investment and consumer spending, thereby 
						having a positive effect on GDP growth. Positive GDP 
						growth forecast for the GCC region is expected to be 
						translated into an increase in construction activities.<br>
						<br>
						Increasing urbanisation and young &amp; growing population 
						base is likely to drive the construction sector across 
						the GCC region. The GCC is also home to a large 
						expatriate population and in a bid to drive real estate 
						growth and investment, the governments of several GCC 
						countries have opened up the real estate sector to 
						foreigners, allowing them to own/lease properties. This, 
						combined with the increasing influx of expatriate 
						population in the region mainly due to shortage of 
						skills among local nationals, is likely to drive housing 
						demand in the GCC’s member countries. <br>
						<br>
						Most of the GCC member countries have also been 
						pro-active in changing their existing regulations in 
						order to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and 
						provide better living conditions to the expatriates 
						giving a further boost to the construction sector. Oman 
						will also benefit from a favourable attitude of the 
						government towards improving transparency in the real 
						estate sector.<br>
						<br>
						Manageable inflation levels in the GCC region coupled 
						with low property prices (as compared to historical 
						prices) are likely to act as demand drivers for 
						residential as well as commercial construction markets.<br>
						<br>
						We have an optimistic outlook on the Omani residential 
						as well as commercial office construction market on the 
						back of healthy growth in population and increasing 
						economic activity.&#8194;</font></td>

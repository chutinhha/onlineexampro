				Oman’s electricity (power) and water sector is going through a 
				tectonic shift. A look at a few illustrative figures.<br>
				<br>
				In the last 40 odd years Oman’s Main Interconnected System (MIS) 
				has initiated a generation capacity of 3,817 MW (mega watt), 
				while from 2012-14, the country will add another 3,490MW of 
				capacity – almost doubling the country’s electricity production 
				base Electricity consumption per capita was 112 per cent higher 
				in 2011 compared to 2000; out of this 77 per cent of the 
				increase occurred since 2005, when the new structure of the 
				sector was implemented with the passing of the Sector Law. 
				Electricity consumption per account was 63 per cent higher than 
				in 2000, with 87 per cent of the increase occurring between 2005 
				and 2011.<br>
				<br>
				The number of electricity accounts per 1,000 head of population 
				increased from 193 in 2000 to 251 in 2011 – indicating an 
				increase in the rate of new household formation.<br>
				<br>
				The number of electricity customer accounts in the Sultanate 
				increased by 49,815, or 7.4 per cent from 677,668 in 2010 to 
				727,483 in 2011. From 2005 to 2011 the number of electricity 
				accounts have increased by 197,332 or 37 per cent.<br>
				<br>
				Electricity Supply in 2011 reached 18.5 TWh (terra watt per 
				hour), 11.4 per cent higher than in 2010 and 95 per cent higher 
				than in 2005. Gross electricity and desalinated water production 
				increased by 10.4 per cent and 9.4 per cent in 2011, 
				respectively.<br>
				<br>
				The structure of electricity demand in Oman is changing as 
				supply to industrial and commercial customers exceeds that of 
				other customer categories. Industrial and commercial customers 
				accounted for 34 per cent of total supply in 2011, up from 23 
				per cent in 2005.<br>
				<br>
				A growing population, increased per capita income and unchanged 
				subsidised electricity tariffs have contributed to a higher 
				demand for electricity. A part of the increase in intensity may 
				also be explained by higher national and personal incomes which 
				have led to more electricity intensive homes with more air 
				conditioning loads and higher electrical appliance usage. Says 
				Qais Saud Al-Zakwani, deputy executive director, Authority for 
				Electricity Regulation (AER), “There are a number of factors 
				that are leading to a growth of electricity demand in the 
				country and these include the growth of the Sultanate’s economy, 
				which mean a growing demand from various free zones and the 
				increase in large industrial customers. Changes in behavioural 
				patterns are also leading to the consumption of more power by 
				customers per account.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Structural change</b><br>
				The passing of the Sector Law and restructuring of the 
				electricity sector as per the directives of Royal Decree No. 
				78/2004 has brought about a sea change in the sector’s 
				functioning. The Royal Decree isolated various activities 
				related to the sector and entrusted them to individual companies 
				operating on a commercial basis, as a precursor to the planned 
				privatisation in future. “The Sector Law ensured a clear 
				allocation of responsibility and accountability, for example 
				there are clear procedures for dealing with customer complaints 
				and the authority as the statutory regulator has a 
				responsibility to protect the interests of customers,” says 
				Zakwani.<br>
				<br>
				The Royal Decree entrusted the AER with the responsibility to 
				govern the water and electricity sector and all the activities 
				related to it like generation, distribution, transmission, 
				purchase and sale of electricity and water. The authority 
				assesses the appropriateness of a company and issues them 
				licenses to carry out designated activities in accordance with 
				certain legal and technical standards. Says Navneet Kasbekar, 
				CEO, Al Kamil Power Company, “The power sector is one of the 
				best managed sectors of the economy as it is well regulated and 
				each of the organisations carry out their roles correctly.”<br>
				<br>
				Similarly, The Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) 
				has been given the statutory responsibility to forecast 
				electricity demand and set out plans to meet forecast demand 
				while maintaining an agreed standard of system security. OPWP is 
				obliged to publish its forecasts and plans, on an annual basis, 
				for the forthcoming seven-year period. OPWP is also responsible 
				for maintaining contracts for enough committed capacity to meet 
				all the power needs of the country. Says Ahmed bin Saleh Al 
				Jahdhami, chief operating officer, OPWP, “We are the single 
				procurer of power and related desalinated water. While 
				laisioning with distribution and supply companies, we do demand 
				forecasting, generation planning and decide on the timing and 
				capacity of new power plants required to develop the forecasted 
				demands. Once the suggested plan gets approved by the AER we 
				liaise with the Tender Board and other agencies to implement the 
				project.” All new power projects in the country are developed by 
				private companies on a build, own and operate model (BOO). While 
				the investment for power plants comes from Independent power 
				producers (IPP’s) or independent water and power project (IWPP) 
				companies, OPWP commits to procure the capacity based on 
				guaranteed availability and efficiency criteria for the tenure 
				of the power procurement contract. These contracts are typically 
				for a period of 15 years. OPWP buys power from I(W)PPs and sells 
				it to supply companies at bulk supply tariffs approved by the 
				AER. OPWP’s forecasts have been very close to the actual demand, 
				which has seen an average growth of 8-10 per cent in recent 
				years. In the summers of 2011 and 2012, the peak demand was 
				forecast to exceed firm contracted capacity through existing 
				power purchase agreements and as such OPWP ensured that this 
				difference was bridged by contracting for temporary diesel 
				generation. Jahdhami adds, “We have never fallen short in 
				fulfilling customer demand. When we plan the power needs of the 
				country, we are obliged to plan for full capacity and this 
				includes reserve margins that need to be maintained at all 
				times.”<br>
				<br>
				The power purchased by OPWP is transmitted to the distribution 
				companies by Oman Electricity Transmission Company (OETC). Saif 
				Abdullah Rashid Al Sumry, chairman of the Board of Directors 
				says, “OETC is the backbone of the transportation of power. We 
				sit in the middle of the electricity value chain, between OPWP 
				and distribution companies. We ensure that there is enough 
				redundancy and backup in the system. For example, if a system 
				needs 100MW then we maintain 200MW of capacity, so if line one 
				goes out due to some contingency, then line 2 can take care of 
				the demand. The effort is to ensure that customers do not 
				experience a loss of power.” OETC has put in place best-in-class 
				systems and has been benchmarking itself against international 
				standards since 2010. OETC looked after transmission in Northern 
				Oman till now, but a decision has been made to integrate the 
				Salalah system with the MIS and work has begun on this process.<br>
				<br>
				Another favourable development helping the stability of the 
				supply is the commencement of the regional grid integration. 
				OETC has done the phase one of the grid integration between Oman 
				and UAE, so that the excess power can flow both ways. Says 
				Sumry, “This is very helpful during peak demand periods 
				especially during the summer months. This became operational in 
				2012 and we have already established a 220KV line for 
				transmitting upto 400MW of power. All the GCC countries will be 
				linked in various phases.”<br>
				<br>
				With Sohar 2, Barka 3 and Sur IPP coming up OETC is gearing up 
				for a step change in the sector by building infrastructure like 
				overhead lines and associated cables, SCADA lines and better 
				insulation. “Topography is a huge challenge especially due to 
				Oman’s mountainous geographical terrain, but we learn as we go 
				along. Moreover we work with some of the best EPC contractors 
				like BEC, L&amp;T, Galfar, Civilco and National Saudi Company,” says 
				Sumry. Johan Van Kerrebroeck, CEO, SMN Power Holding adds, “The 
				power infrastructure in Oman has developed very well. OPWP and 
				OETC have a clear vision and a well structured approach.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Growing customer base</b><br>
				There are three distribution companies – Majan Electricity 
				Company, Mazoon Electricity Company and Muscat Electricity 
				Distribution Company (MEDC) that take care of the distribution 
				of electricity to various parts of the Sultanate. Says Ahmed bin 
				Saif Khamis Al-Mazrouy, general manager, Majan Electricity, “We 
				are licensed for two roles: buy electricity and sell it to 
				customers. We have a customer base of 150,000 customers which is 
				growing by 7,000-8,000 each year.” The company covers an area of 
				50,000 sq kms and is licensed to supply electricity to North 
				Batinah, Barka and Buraimi. Commercial and industrial customers 
				accounted for 50 per cent of Majan Electricity’s total power 
				supply in 2011 supply, compared to just 21 per cent in 2005 and 
				40 per cent in 2010 – a reflection of the growing 
				industrialisation of its operational area.<br>
				<br>
				Mazoon Electricity Company supplies electricity in Dakiliya, 
				Sharqiya and South Al Batinah regions. Says Zahir Abdullah Al 
				Abri, general manager, Mazoon Electricity Company, “The company 
				has 280,000 customers and we have been witnessing double digit 
				growth in electricity demand in our licensed areas. In 2012-14, 
				Mazoon Electricity will invest RO200mn in network upgradation to 
				ensure that its infrastructure and services are in line with 
				customer expectations.”<br>
				<br>
				MEDC is licensed by AER for the distribution and supply of 
				electricity in the Muscat governorate, covering an authorised 
				area of 3,900 sq kms. The company has unveiled a five year 
				business strategy for the 2012-17 period. The strategy dovetails 
				five key areas – customer service, asset management, HR, HSE and 
				communication. As a part of this strategy MEDC is expanding its 
				customer service outlets. The company opened an outlet in Muscat 
				Grand Mall recently, and there are plans to open more shops in 
				the near future. These outlets will be open till 10pm adding to 
				customer convenience. Says Abdullah bin Said Al Badri, CEO, 
				MEDC, “The company has also introduced pre-paid metres for the 
				first time in the GCC region. These metres will give customers 
				real time feedback on their power usage and help in saving 
				electricity.” These metres have passed the trial stage and 
				customers will be given a choice to install such metres once the 
				trial period is over. Applicants for temporary connection can 
				now avail of these type of metres. These metres can be reused at 
				different sites and will come in handy for EPC companies having 
				multiple construction sites. MEDC has also commissioned a remote 
				metre reading initiative. This is being rolled out in 2,000 high 
				consumption metres initially. Self service and bill paying 
				machines for customers are also under consideration. The company 
				has allocated RO155mn for its current three year budget 
				(2012-2014) for reinforcement and expansion of its distribution 
				network to meet rising demand for supply in the governorate of 
				Muscat. According to MEDC’s 2011 annual report, the customer 
				base of the company has been increasing by eight per cent per 
				annum reaching 221,500 customers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>T&amp;D losses</b><br>
				Transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses have been an area of 
				concern for the sector in the past, but AER’s penalties and 
				incentive scheme has brought about significant improvements in 
				this direction. Says Zakwani, “We set losses targets for 
				distribution and supply licensees in the Main Interconnected 
				System along with an incentive mechanism wherein they are able 
				to retain a portion of the savings from achieving the losses 
				target. This started in 2008 and we set ourselves a benchmark 
				against international standards. We still think that the T&amp;D 
				losses are high but they have come down substantially from 24.6 
				per cent in 2004 to 13.7 per cent in 2011 and we are aiming to 
				reach 10 per cent in 2014.”<br>
				<br>
				Distribution companies have been playing their part in bringing 
				down distribution losses. In the last four years Majan 
				Electricity’s losses have come down from 18 to 11.9 per cent. 
				Says Mazrouy, “A majority of these losses are commercial losses, 
				while the technical losses are four per cent, far less than the 
				permissible seven per cent.” The company has set itself a target 
				of bringing down commercial losses to seven per cent and 
				technical losses down to 0.5 per cent. Mazoon Electricity has 
				similarly brought down T&amp;D losses from the mid 20s in 2005 to 14 
				per cent in 2011. As commercial losses are due to faulty metres 
				or people tampering with the metres, these companies have 
				stepped up the supervision and inspection of metres.<br>
				The other area that distribution are working relentlessly is the 
				Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI). This 
				represents the average outage duration that any given customer 
				would experience. For instance, in the case of Majan Electricity 
				this figure is 52 minutes per customer per year. “Our CAIDI used 
				to be 200 minutes; we have brought it down substantially and are 
				looking at bringing it down to 10 minutes by strengthening our 
				network and by deploying an asset management system for planned 
				shutdowns,” says Mazrouy.<br>
				<br>
				CAIDI for Mazoon Electricity is 65 minutes and it is targeting 
				to bring this down to 60 minutes. Says Abri “We have been 
				sending our people to schools and community groups like Omani 
				Women’s Association to educate them about the need to conserve 
				electricity. The Public Authority for Electricity and Water 
				(PAEW) is undertaking a study with JICA of Japan to come up with 
				a conservation policy and we expect new guidelines to come up 
				soon.” OETC has been lending a hand in reducing losses by 
				increasing the transmission voltage. Says Sumry, “We are trying 
				to increase the transmission voltage from 132MW to 220KW and 
				then to 400 KW, and this will help in bringing down T&amp;D losses 
				as a certain amount of electricity gets wasted while 
				transmitting it over long distances.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Alternative Energy </b><br>
				Rural Areas Electricity Company (RAECO) primarily undertakes 
				electricity generation, transmission, distribution, supply and 
				desalination activities in the rural areas of Oman. The company 
				commenced operations on May 1, 2005. RAECO operates power plants 
				for the generation and supply of electricity to the Dhofar, 
				Musandam and Al-Wusta governorates. The power generated from 
				RAECO’s plants in these regions is supplied directly to 
				customers. It also operates desalination plants in Abu Mudhaibi, 
				Sowgrah (Al Wusta), Kumzer (Musandam), Masirah (Al Sharqiyah)and 
				Al Hallaniyat (Dhofar). The desalinated water is sold on bulk to 
				PAEW at an approved water sales tariff.<br>
				<br>
				RAECO has also been assigned the responsibility of undertaking 
				pilot projects for exploring the potential of alternative 
				sources of energy in the Sultanate. Says Ahmed Said Al Harthy, 
				senior manager, Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Services, 
				head of Renewable Energy Team, “RAECO was assigned the 
				responsibility of undertaking pilot projects to explore the 
				potential of solar power and wind energy sources as these are 
				considered to be the most feasible for Oman.” RAECO has formed a 
				renewable energy team to cooperate with the AER. The team is 
				studying the available technology and has zeroed in on some 
				locations that seem to be well suited for setting up alternative 
				energy projects in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				The studies and presentations have shown that there is good 
				potential for solar and wind energy in Oman and there has been a 
				huge interest from investors. “RAECO received 12 investor 
				proposals to set up plants at 33 locations. This shows the huge 
				interest of investors in Oman’s renewable energy space,” says 
				Harthy.<br>
				<br>
				The initial shortlisting included six plants with 8.6MW 
				installed capacity. Says Harthy, “Implementing such projects 
				will serve different objectives including testing the technology 
				under local climatic conditions like dust, humidity, assessment 
				of fuel savings using renewable technology, assessment of 
				carbon-di-oxide emission reduction as compared to using fossil 
				fuel and studying the impact of using renewable energy 
				technologies on the security of power supply etc.” The solar 
				power plants will be in Al Wusta and Dhofar and some of them are 
				expected to be executed within the coming few months. Two of 
				these projects based in Masirah and Thumrait will be based on 
				wind energy.<br>
				<br>
				AER appointed a consultant to evaluate these proposals from a 
				technical point of view, and based on its report five projects 
				were shortlisted. RAECO along with AER is developing a power 
				purchase agreement on a BOO model with the shortlisted 
				companies. RAECO is also looking at ways to synchronise these 
				alternative energy plants with its existing diesel power plants.<br>
				<br>
				AER’s Renewable Energy Resources Report in May 2008 created a 
				lot of interest but despite the obvious potential of solar 
				energy there seems to have been tardy progress in this 
				direction. Jahdhami explains, “The AER study considered the 
				potential of alternative energy sources in Oman and made clear 
				recommendations for further detailed studies in this regard. 
				PAEW conducted a more detailed feasibility study for developing 
				a large scale solar power plants of upto 200MW in the country. 
				The study has been completed and is under consideration by the 
				government but the decision on it is still pending. Two sites 
				were selected as optimum sites for large scale solar plants and 
				ground monitoring stations were erected, from which data is 
				being monitored by OPWP. Zakwani adds, “The Public Authority for 
				Electricity and Water (PAEW) is working on a renewable energy 
				policy and we will pursue renewable energy projects based on the 
				policy formulated by the PAEW.”<br>
				<br>
				Says Kasbekar, “Alternative energy projects are taking time and 
				the tenders for solar power plants should have come out by now. 
				The cost of solar panels are coming down every two-three years 
				and I am sure that it will become quite competitive in 
				comparison to gas fired plants soon, though for now it is still 
				an expensive option.” In 2008 the cost of per megawatt of power 
				generated by solar power plants was eight times more than the 
				cost of per megawatt generated by conventional gas based plants, 
				but the gap between the two is being bridged fast. However, 
				putting up solar projects has its own set of challenges such as 
				dust formation on solar panels in desert conditions and the high 
				manual or mechanical costs for cleaning and maintaining them.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Bottleneck concerns</b><br>
				Most power plants in the country are fuelled by natural gas, and 
				with Oman using gas for industrial clusters apart from its long 
				term LNG commitments there have been some concerns about the 
				availability of gas as a feedstock for electricity plants in the 
				country. The electricity and related water sector consumed 5.3 
				per cent more gas in 2011 than in 2010, to support increased 
				electricity and water production of 10.6 per cent and 9.1 per 
				cent, respectively. Says Kerrebroeck, “Once in a while there 
				have been hiccups in gas supply but nothing major that worries 
				us. We do not think that the gas supply is decreasing. Gas was 
				discovered by accident while looking for oil, but now companies 
				are looking directly for gas and with better drilling 
				technology, the prospects for gas look good.”<br>
				<br>
				Though the government has made it clear that electricity and 
				desalination plants are its topmost priority and that there will 
				be no shortfall in the availability of gas for such plants, the 
				AER is aware of the opportunity cost of using natural gas to 
				generate electricity and this is a prime driver of its drive to 
				tap renewable energy sources. AER’s 2011 annual report states, 
				“Natural gas is one of the Sultanate’s most important and 
				valuable natural resources that has supported economic 
				development for over 30 years and will continue to do so for the 
				foreseeable future…The gas used to produce 7.2TWh of electricity 
				and 52 million m3 of desalinated water in 2000 accounted for 
				19.1 per cent of total Oman gas use. By 2011, following 
				increases in electricity and desalinated water production of 180 
				per cent and 190 per cent, respectively, total gas use had 
				increased by 124 per cent but the electricity sector’s share of 
				gas use was 19.5 per cent, similar to its 2000 share and 
				indicating significant improvement in gas use efficiency.<br>
				<br>
				The structure of domestic gas use changed considerably between 
				2000 and 2011. While the electricity sector’s share remained 
				close to 19 per cent, gas use by industrial areas and projects 
				increased from 27.4 per cent in 2000 to 58.1 per cent in 2011. 
				Gas use at oil fields, flared gas and other uses accounted for 
				22.4 per cent of total gas use in 2011, significantly less than 
				the 53.5 per cent share in 2000. As many as 97.5 per cent of 
				total electricity production in 2011 was fuelled by natural gas, 
				with diesel generation accounting for just 2.5 per cent of total 
				electricity production.<br>
				<br>
				The AER believes that gas used at electricity and water 
				facilities has a high opportunity cost. Aside from the fact that 
				the international price of gas is substantially above the price 
				at which gas is sold for domestic use, any increase in the 
				volume of gas used at electricity and water facilities reduces 
				gas available for industrial areas and projects that may 
				generate significant national economic benefits. The Authority 
				believes it would be sensible (in terms of fuel 
				diversification), timely (as 3,500 MW of new MIS gas fired 
				capacity will be commissioned by 2015) and economically 
				beneficial to initiate the competitive deployment of renewable 
				energy, starting with the large solar project proposed by PAEW. 
				This would reduce the electricity sector’s reliance on natural 
				gas, make more gas available for alternative and possibly higher 
				value added activities, and help Oman prepare to meet future 
				obligations arising from the successor to the Kyoto Protocol to 
				which Oman is a Non-Annex 1 country. The authority’s renewable 
				energy initiatives were in response to His Majesty’s direction 
				to identify ways in which Oman can benefit from its abundant 
				renewable energy resources and reduce its energy deficit. 
				Despite the limited progress made to date, the Authority remains 
				committed to working towards this goal.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Small is beautiful</b><br>
				Neighbouring countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have put up 
				large capacity power plants while Oman has usually gone for 
				comparatively smaller plants. A question often raised is why did 
				Oman not set up large power plants in the past? Says Jahdhami, 
				“Firstly, compared to some other countries in the region, the 
				overall installed capacity in Oman has not been as huge. 
				Secondly, when you look at the whole system, sizing and location 
				of new power plants are done through generation expansion 
				modelling and in coordination with the system operator. 
				Proximity to demand centres and system constraints are also 
				considered in addition to economical as well as security of 
				supply aspects. Nadeem Rizwi, CEO, ACWA Power Barka adds, “Oman 
				has been a pioneer in the electricity sector in privatisation. 
				The water and power sector have been managed well and they have 
				done it at their own pace, by optimising their capacity. Too 
				much extra capacity in the system could potentially be a waste 
				and a financial burden.” Moreover, Oman is working on installing 
				plants of upto 2,000MW now. Says Zakwani, “There seems to be 
				over reliance on ensuring enough generation capacity is 
				available on the system. Capacity is not everything; we must 
				focus on investing in a robust network to bring that capacity to 
				the doorsteps of customers, so there needs to be investment in 
				the electricity infrastructure as a whole and that is happening 
				as OETC takes steps to upgrade the transmission network and the 
				distribution and supply licensees are working hard to upgrade 
				their networks.”<br>
				<br>
				The power sector in Oman has always had the ability to attract 
				interest from the best of international companies and financing 
				from local and international banks and ECAs reflecting the 
				strength of the sector. Says Jahdhami, “Even during the global 
				financial crisis we have been able to attract financing of 
				planned projects because the investors’ perception of the risk 
				of Oman is low due to a robust legal framework in the country 
				and high confidence in the independent regulator for the 
				electricity sector. We have been able to achieve financial 
				closure in a challenging environment and despite the fact that 
				the government has stopped giving guarantees to IPPs.” OPWP is 
				rated A by two rating agencies, Moody’s and S&amp;P.<br>
				<br>
				Stock market investors and institutions have always exhibited a 
				lot of faith in power companies, reflecting the strength of the 
				sector. In 2004, the then AES Barka offloaded 35 per cent of its 
				stake to the public and the IPO was oversubscribed 17 times, 
				showing the strength and faith of investors. An Initial Public 
				Offering (IPO) of 35 per cent of the shares of Al Rusail Power 
				Company and SMN Barka through the listing of SMN Power Holding 
				on the MSM was floated in September-October 2011. The IPO was 
				oversubscribed 1.7 times.<br>
				<br>
				Says Kerrebroeck, “In volatile times or uncertain times people 
				invest in products that offer a high level of reliability and we 
				have strong assets and a stable cash flow. Secondly we buy fuel 
				from the government and sell electricity and water to the 
				government, so the risk is very low. Finally, in Oman government 
				bodies respect contracts and things are done in a professional 
				and legal way.”<br>
				<b><br>
				Future prospects</b><br>
				Looking ahead, the electricity sector seems to be poised for 
				promising growth. Says Jahdhami, “We are comfortable with Sur 
				and Barka 2 power plants, but we are not relaxing. We are 
				considering another project in Salalah IPP II, which will have a 
				200-400 MW capacity and have appointed advisors for this. We are 
				also studying the power needs of Duqm and are seeing the best 
				way to cater for the demand.” Sumri adds, “The intent of 
				restructuring the sector has been achieved. But it’s about time 
				to look at a review of the business, as in any large 
				organisational change there may be areas that are overlooked. 
				This does not mean that we are moving in the wrong direction, 
				but just that there is an opportunity to revisit the 2004 
				initiative and find the areas of improvement.” The electricity 
				sector has come a long way since the promulgation of the Sector 
				Law of 2004, with better efficiencies, transparency and 
				accountability, and the Sultanate is poised to build on this 
				strong foundation now.</td>

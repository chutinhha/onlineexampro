                		The hospitality industry cannot escape the fact that 
				there is an ever increasing need to provide medical care to its 
				best market, ageing baby boomers. If planned correctly this need 
				not be a burden but a great opportunity. Part of that planning 
				process will be to develop the appropriate legal strategies that 
				will protect hoteliers from the array of potential liabilities 
				that come with providing medical care. In addition to being a 
				member of a law firm with a global reputation in both 
				hospitality and health care law I am one of those ageing baby 
				boomers who loves to travel. <br>
				<br>
				My own parents looked forward to a retirement in which they 
				could see more of the world and get away from the miserable and 
				cold New England winters. The time share and warm weather resort 
				brochures were always present in the house. A series of medical 
				problems for my father put a halt to these plans. None of them 
				were that serious or life threatening but enough that he needed 
				a home health aide and physical therapy. While to medical 
				professionals, his problems were minor, just easily treated 
				rehabilitative care, to my father and his primary caregiver, my 
				mother, these were life changing and serious enough that travel 
				plans were cancelled. For the hotels and resorts they planned on 
				visiting it was one more empty room and as you look at the 
				hundreds of thousands of families like them across the US, 
				Europe and the Middle East that loss of revenue multiplies into 
				millions of dollars.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Medical Tourism Versus Medical Care<br>
				</b>There has been a lot of attention given to the new field of 
				medical tourism and the significant benefits and risks it 
				presents to hotels and resorts. There is a significant 
				difference in legal risk depending on how one defines “medical 
				tourism”, and how it varies from “medical care” while being a 
				tourist. Wikipedia defines medical tourism as “… a term 
				initially coined by travel agencies and the mass media to 
				describe the rapidly-growing practice of travelling across 
				international borders to obtain health care.” It goes on to 
				state, “Services typically sought by travellers include elective 
				procedures as well as complex specialised surgeries such as 
				joint replacement (knee/hip), cardiac surgery, dental surgery, 
				and cosmetic surgeries.” This describes some very complex, 
				invasive and, from a liability lawyers point of few, some very 
				risky activities. We will look at how to quantify, predict and 
				minimise those risks later in this article.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Potential Market<br>
				</b>There is a much larger universe of clients and potential 
				clients that need some medical care but are not travelling 
				because of medical reasons but despite medical needs. The ageing 
				baby boomer population creates an ever-growing market of 
				potential clients. Many will stay at home because they think 
				travel will deny them the simple medical care to treat diabetes, 
				colostomies, strokes and a long list of other ailments, readily 
				available by relatively lower paid semi-skilled health care 
				aides and therapists. However, for more involved procedures, it 
				is far more likely that they will want to travel not for the 
				surgery touted by the medical tourism industry but to recuperate 
				and get simple rehabilitative care from surgery done at their 
				local hospital. Targeting this market is especially attractive 
				in place like Oman which has undertaken a major effort to train 
				health care workers and to become a center of destination 
				resorts<br>
				<br>
				<b>Facilitators<br>
				</b>Medical tourism has become highly reliant on “facilitators”. 
				These middlemen perform a variety of functions: arranging for 
				medical and travel related services, advising in the selection 
				of the destination provider, arranging for the forwarding of 
				medical records and information, facilitating the payment of 
				fees, setting up aftercare facilities and functions, liaising 
				with insurance companies and other relevant participants. 
				Hoteliers may wish to utilise some type of facilitator to assist 
				with some of the medical tourism arrangements listed above, but 
				for most medical maintenance care, even for rehabilitative 
				services, a paid liaison is not necessary.<br>
				<br>
				From a liability aspect working without a facilitator arguably 
				makes things much more straight forward as there is a great deal 
				of legal uncertainty regarding which parties are exposed to 
				risk. However having a written contract with a facilitator that 
				is experienced, well qualified, fully insured and financially 
				solid will significantly reduce but not eliminate the hotel’s 
				risk. Because this is a new industry and multiple jurisdictions 
				are involved with any transaction as well as the numerous 
				opportunities for miscommunication of medical information, 
				eliminating risk is an impossible dream. The key task in medical 
				tourism is to reduce and manage the risk. Key principles to 
				consider when choosing a facilitator would include:<br>
				Medical tourism facilitators are not travel agents, they need to 
				understand health care.<br>
				They will be able to clearly in all needed languages communicate 
				to the client; they must be transmitting medical information but 
				have to understand that they are making no medical decisions.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Do they have the client and client’s family play an active 
				role in communicating with care givers at home and in the 
				visited country?<br>
				</b><br>
				<b>Do they make it clear who they represent as an agent and what 
				risks they assume? </b><br>
				What are the language differences, written and spoken, among all 
				the parties and what is the plan and back up plan to be sure 
				these terms, often medical and scientific and fraught with 
				emotion, are truly understood by the parties.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is their system for maintaining, updating and backing up 
				records and communications?<br>
				Are they using a legal counsel in the home and visiting country 
				and are they giving the client an opportunity to do the same?</b><br>
				Do they recognise the “Murphy’s Law” (If anything can go wrong 
				it will and at the worse time”) factors? Is there cancellation 
				insurance? Avenues for a second opinion? Emergency trauma and 
				evacuation plans? Back up lists of caregiver? Health care 
				workers get sick too.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Minimising Risk</b><br>
				I am sure there are many additional points of caution that can 
				be added to this list in merely having a role in the medical 
				tourism venture. An area of concern in some destination 
				countries are the medical procedures that are banned in many 
				jurisdictions and therefore force patients to travel for stem 
				cell treatment, experimental drug use, invitro-fertilisation 
				etc. These areas may have criminal risks and merely being a 
				participant, if another is offering these treatments or 
				procedures, could open a Pandora’s box of risk. The MENA region 
				has seen very little of this activity but caution is advised 
				before proceeding. <br>
				<br>
				One of the purposes of this article is to have hospitality 
				professionals consider the benefits of offering some basic 
				medical care and rehabilitation without undertaking the risks 
				and activities accompanying what we’ve defined as “medical 
				tourism”. <br>
				<br>
				The legal principles needed to assist consumers with their 
				health needs are far fewer than in medical tourism. Here are 
				some points to keep in mind:<br>
				Work with governmental health regulatory agencies to develop 
				lists of licensed health care entities or individuals and keep 
				this list up to date. Have the governmental tourism agency 
				liaise with their health colleagues if possible. <br>
				<br>
				Retain an international law firm that will understand the laws 
				in the customer’s country and host country and that can draft 
				agreements with local health providers and disclaimers of 
				liability.<br>
				<br>
				Make it clear to all parties that these health care providers 
				are not the hotel’s agents, employees or have any relationship 
				in which you guarantee their work. Provide license number of the 
				provider and the contact information of the licensing agency. 
				Have the customer agree that they understand this disclaimer.<br>
				<br>
				If the hotel has a health care concierge be sure that all print 
				materials have a disclaimer and there is a sign posting at his 
				desk. Hotels are not responsible for the non affiliated 
				restaurants and recreation services they arrange and be sure the 
				customer know this and where he can contact with inquiries or 
				complaints.<br>
				<br>
				If health care providers have an office on hotel property, be 
				sure it is distinct from hotel offices &amp; facilities and there 
				are similar disclaimers. Rental car companies may be using or 
				leasing space from the hotel but it is clear the hotel is not a 
				party to the rental relationship.<br>
				<br>
				If caregivers are providing nursing, personal or physical 
				therapy at the hotel facility, they require a picture 
				identification badge distinct from hotel IDs. <br>
				<br>
				The hotel should not be the keeper of records however it should 
				have an emergency care plan and note specific medical issues 
				such diabetics. Many jurisdictions have significant and complex 
				patient privacy laws and hotels should avoid receiving 
				information and have steps in place to safeguard any information 
				they do receive. Notice should be given that this information is 
				being kept as a courtesy and not a requirement. It would be a 
				good idea to have a place in the room where medical records 
				could be kept and easily found by caregivers or EMTs, but hotel 
				staff be instructed that it is not for their eyes.<br>
				<br>
				Recommend to customers that all medications should be kept in 
				the room safe and the individual using them know how to access 
				the safe.<br>
				<br>
				Determine with food services what special diets you can 
				accommodate low sugar, salt etc., but give the appropriate 
				disclaimers for that as well as for food allergies. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Conclusion</b><br>
				The courts in Europe, the US and the MENA region have seen few 
				of these cases, but most judges surveyed indicated that full 
				disclosure to the consumer is paramount. The more information 
				provided in plain language, with frequent, specific 
				acknowledgements, the more likely the judge will shift the risk 
				to the consumer and away from the hotel. Be aware that one 
				jurist noted a particular dislike of the lengthy, complex small 
				print web site disclaimer with the check off box at the end.<br>
				<br>
				The GCC countries are well suited to attract visitors with 
				medical care needs. The region has been largely unaffected by 
				the political problems of North Africa and the Levant. The 
				quality of health care has been vastly improved by the 
				investments made by the oil rich governments and the thoughtful 
				joint ventures being done with premier hospitals in the United 
				States, England and Central Europe.<br>
				<br>
				Countries like Oman have developed turnkey operations for 
				ambulance services /emergency care with George Washington 
				Hospital. Nursing, physical therapy and rehabilitative care are 
				key specialties at area universities and private companies like 
				Rochester Wellness in the UAE and Oman offer world class 
				aftercare capabilities. Families from the MENA region are well 
				known to travel together as a group, and destinations that are 
				welcoming to all members of the family especially the highly 
				respected elders will be rewarded with frequent and long stays.<br>
				<br>
				The well financed Gulf region races to meet global medical 
				standards which will give patients confidence that they will be 
				safe and well cared for even if their condition worsens or they 
				have an emergency. Weather plays a role in making the area 
				attractive. Who wants to be cooped up inside during a cold 
				dreary winter in England or New England when they can settle in 
				at a sunny destination resort with golf courses, palm trees, 
				great food and quality services? Recuperation in a Gulf hotel or 
				resort may be just what the doctor orders and the industry can 
				benefit by taking the right legal prescriptions.&#8194;</font></td>

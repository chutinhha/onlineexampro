				Oman’s geography seems to be created with an “A-Z” of four wheel 
				driving experiences in mind, and SUVs make up an enormous part 
				of the automotive sales market in the country<br>
				</b><br>
				It When it comes to drawing up a template of a nation that 
				delivers the most extensive range of off-road terrain and 
				driving excitement, it is hard to look much further than the 
				Sultanate of Oman. As you drive around the nation it seems as if 
				the nation’s geography was created with an “A-Z” of four wheel 
				driving experiences in mind. Today the only major difference 
				from 1970 in a country celebrating over four decades of 
				successful national development and success is simply the speed 
				with which the adventurous Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) owner 
				can reach some of the most outstanding areas of natural beauty 
				in the country.<br>
				<br>
				Off-road enthusiasts are spoiled for choice with fantastic 
				desert driving in the Sharqiya Sands or the edge of the Empty 
				Quarter competing with remote Wadis, exhilarating steep mountain 
				driving terrain in the Hajar Mountains, remote beaches and salt 
				flats as just some of the highlights this extraordinary country 
				has to offer.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The Oman Off-Road Story<br>
				</b>At the time of the Renaissance in 1970 the only effective 
				way to get around the country in any kind of comfort or safety 
				was an off-road four wheel drive vehicle. It was the essential 
				workhorse for accessing Oman’s oilfields, remote towns and 
				villages, vital for farmers and for people who simply wanted to 
				be able to move pretty much anything from point A to point B.<br>
				In a country with less than 20 kilometres of paved highway – 
				there was little choice but to look for rugged vehicles that 
				could handle the most demanding terrain. And over the past 41 
				years the appetite of commercial operators in Oman and 
				increasingly individual owners for SUVs has been phenomenal and 
				has grown side by side with the nation’s extraordinary economic 
				growth during this period.<br>
				<br>
				In any village, town or city in Oman you will find SUVs anywhere 
				you look – and of varying vintages as well. We were not 
				surprised to have discovered that a huge number of Pajeros still 
				being driven date back to just a few years after its first 
				introduction in 1982 and many have hundreds of thousands of 
				kilometres on the clock but are still going strong. The 
				four-wheel drive off-road vehicle was naturally the most 
				practical transportation of choice many years ago. And even 
				today, manufacturers like Mitsubishi remain loyal to their roots 
				by providing a modern SUV that has become a true lifestyle 
				balance, enabling the owner to combine comfort and performance 
				with the ability to drive across the most challenging driving 
				conditions the Sultanate can offer. In a country such as Oman it 
				is ideal to have an SUV that has this ability to satisfy the 
				customer in every kind of driving environment.<br>

				<font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				One recent trend in the market has also been the development of 
				smaller SUVs such as the Outlander and ASX that offer a great 
				safe driving experience with a number of off-road capabilities 
				to give the owner the best of both worlds. Meanwhile many of the 
				latest SUVs on offer in the market today do not all fit this 
				heritage, with many compromising on their predecessors off-road 
				driving credentials in favour of appearance and style, a trend 
				that has been imported from other countries where a lot of SUVs 
				have never left the tarmac. SUVs make up an enormous part of the 
				automotive sales market here in Oman. For example at Mitsubishi 
				49 per cent of our sales across the country in 2011 were 
				four-wheel drive vehicles with SUV sales in the capital a little 
				higher at 52 per cent, with all of these vehicles combining 
				excellent on-road driving performance with superb off-road 
				capabilities. And from the inquiries we get at our showrooms 
				across the nation – the appetite for the SUV and “go anywhere, 
				do anything” style of vehicles looks set to stay with us for 
				many years to come.<br>
				<br>
				<b>SUVs – From Workhorse to Lifestyle Favourite<br>
				</b>In a country like Oman and indeed across the Gulf – the 
				Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) has become one of the most common 
				sights on the highways of the region. The region has one of the 
				highest percentages of SUV ownership in the world – reflecting 
				the challenging terrain that dominates so much of this area. But 
				the biggest change in four decades has been the move away from 
				what was always a workhorse for commercial operators, farmers 
				and those living in remote communities to much more of a 
				lifestyle choice.<br>
				<br>
				In many ways the engineering and off-road capabilities have not 
				changed significantly – although they are constantly upgraded 
				and enhanced. It is inside the vehicle that the changes have 
				been most significant – attracting every kind of driver and 
				their family to consider purchasing a SUV. Modern SUVs – of 
				which the Mitsubishi Pajero and Outlander are typical - have all 
				the comforts, sophistication and great road handling of a 
				regular car, providing fantastic family safety, space and 
				practicality for any kind of use without compromising on its 
				off-road abilities. And unlike those you might find in the heart 
				of European or American capitals – individual owners here who 
				purchase their SUV as a lifestyle vehicle have an unrivalled 
				opportunity to use it in just the kind of off-road terrain they 
				are built to handle. In a nation like Oman we are unlikely to 
				see the phenomenon of the “Chelsea Tractor” where families buy 
				large SUVs almost as a status symbol in some European capitals – 
				with no intention of ever taking the vehicle off-road or 
				“getting it dirty.”<br>
				<br>
				A quick check of many office car parks on a Saturday morning in 
				Muscat or other major centres and the number of dust and 
				sand-covered vehicles is a testament to the enduring ability of 
				the SUV in the Sultanate to put a smile on its owner’s face on a 
				weekend.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Three Decades of the Pajero<br>
				</b>There is no doubt that one of the most common SUV sights on 
				the roads of Oman – wherever you may be – is that of the 
				Mitsubishi Pajero. First introduced to the Sultanate in 1982, 
				the Pajero this year is celebrating 30 enormously successful 
				years since its initial launch. An off-road thoroughbred – the 
				modern Pajero is as comfortable taking families around the 
				capital or major cities, on long highway trips across the 
				Sultanate or to neighbouring countries as it is getting out into 
				its original natural habitat off-road in the desert, mountain or 
				wadi. It was also 30 years ago that the Pajero made its debut in 
				the Dakar Rally and it remains the most successful vehicle to 
				ever participate in the Dakar Rally winning its class 7 out of 
				the last 10 races, and 15 of the full 32 races. Major commercial 
				operations continue to use the Pajero as the base of their 
				fleets for working on remote oil projects in the desert, major 
				infrastructure projects in the Muscat area and for the widest 
				use of applications all over the Sultanate. Its reliability and 
				durability, added to its comfort and excellent value for money 
				means the Pajero is set to maintain its position as a leader in 
				the SUV section in Oman over the next 30 years as well.<br>
				<br>
				And it can offer the driver and their family friends a 
				guaranteed way to put an enormous smile on everyone’s face with 
				its ability to get to some of the most remote and outstandingly 
				beautiful parts of this wonderful nation.&#8194;<br>

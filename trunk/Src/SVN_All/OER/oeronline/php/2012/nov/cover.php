				<br>
				Yuthar al Rawahi<br>
				Founder and Chairperson<br>
				National Association for Cancer Awareness<br>
				<br>
				The idea of offering support and comfort to cancer patients 
				turned into afternoons in Yuthar’s living room with like minded 
				people, both men and women, who felt that something needed to be 
				done about the lack of information available about cancer in 
				Oman, especially with the growing numbers of Omanis affected by 
				the disease. Thus was born National Association for Cancer 
				Awareness (NACA) and since then, Yuthar, a three times cancer 
				survivor has been leading the battle against cancer by spreading 
				awareness about the deadly disease and ways to prevent it. Her 
				chairperson’s message on NACA site states – “I am not a doctor, 
				I am not a psychiatrist – I am just a woman who went through an 
				experience”.<br>

				Finacle, the banking software products division of India’s 
				Information Technology giant Infosys, has teamed up with 
				International Information Technology Company (IITC) of OHI group 
				to offer cutting-edge next generation banking solutions, 
				including self-contained Islamic banking software, in the 
				Sultanate. Fiancle which serves 150 banks in 75 countries world 
				over has a significant presence in the Middle East, especially 
				in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan. Apart from Oman where it 
				currently provides two leading banks with its advanced core 
				banking solution, Fiancle is looking to strengthen in presence 
				in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar.<br>
				“Oman is a very interesting market for us for multiple reasons,” 
				says Haragopal Mangipudi, senior vice president and global head, 
				Finacle, who recently visited Oman. “The economy is robust and 
				growing; the banks are able to demonstrate excellent appetite 
				both in terms of retail as well as the corporate banking. There 
				is tremendous amount of opportunities for them to make a 
				difference by bringing in a differentiated customer experience 
				in retail segment and offering multiple product line in the 
				corporate segment.”<br>
				Highlighting the importance Fiancle accords to Islamic banking 
				services, Haragopal adds, “Islamic finance is a key thrust area 
				for us. Unlike various other players in the market, when Islamic 
				finance emerged we went in with full focus and vigour in terms 
				of investing rather than just tweaking our conventional banking 
				products. Therefore Oman is a key market for us in the region.”<br>
				Finacle Islamic banking solution offers an integrated and 
				comprehensive approach for banks to define and present Shariah-compliant 
				products to customers. Strong product definition features, 
				support for Islamic accounting and complete traceability for 
				audit differentiate the solution. Completely self-contained, it 
				is replete with the accounting backbone to support back office 
				functionalities and provides Straight Through Processing (STP) 
				capabilities on a SOA platform.<br>

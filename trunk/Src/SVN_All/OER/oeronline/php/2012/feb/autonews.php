				The new 2012 version of Rosa bus, one of the world’s most 
				popular mid-size buses, was introduced to the Omani market by 
				FUSO, recently. Its powerful engine, reliable performance and 
				exceptional comfort have in recent years made the Rosa bus from 
				FUSO one of the most popular and well liked buses of its kind. 
				It is available in three body sizes – with the 30 and 34-seater 
				versions especially popular in addition to the option to 
				purchase the smaller 26-seater edition. Commenting on the new 
				2012 model, Mark Tomlinson, general manger of Mitsubishi of FUSO 
				in Oman says, “Already a market leader in some parts of the 
				world, the Rosa’s popularity in Oman has grown steadily in 
				recent years and we are confident that the arrival of the 2012 
				edition of the bus will only help to increase that popularity 
				and demand among a very wide customer base here across the 
				Sultanate.”</font><p style="margin: 10px; " class="style3">

				After posting the best sales month of the year in December, GM’s 
				dealers in the Middle East reported total sales of 139,431 
				vehicles for 2011 - up 13 percent compared to 2010. The 
				impressive sales performance was the result of robust sales 
				throughout the region for the company’s line-up of passenger 
				cars, crossovers, sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickups 
				across the Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands. In 2011, sales of 
				GM’s passenger cars increased by 8 percent, crossovers recorded 
				23 percent sales growth, sales of SUVs were up 21 percent, while 
				GM’s pickups registered a 14 percent sales gain. Newly launched 
				vehicles contributed to GM’s sales growth. Combined sales of the 
				Chevrolet Captiva, Camaro, Cruze and Traverse; the GMC Terrain; 
				and the Cadillac SRX and CTS Coupe increased by 23 per cent in 
				2011. Sales of GM Middle East’s three brands all recorded strong

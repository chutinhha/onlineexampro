				<br>
                		Low private sector penetration in tertiary health care 
						constitutes one of the biggest challenges facing the 
						healthcare sector in the Sultanate. There is no dearth 
						of polyclinics or medical centers in the country; but as 
						the population increases and ages, the public sector 
						hospitals are under pressure to deal with an increasing 
						number of more complex cases. Having to wait a long time 
						to access good quality care and some specialty 
						treatments in the Sultanate, an increasing number of 
						people are forced to seek them in India, Thailand and 
						Western countries. The solution to this pressing problem 
						lies in setting up multispecialty hospitals equipped 
						with internationally experienced and trusted doctors 
						working in world-class facilities, and capable of 
						offering all sorts of care under one umbrella.<br>
						<br>
						UK-based Starcare Health Systems which opened Starcare 
						Hospital, a 50-bed premium facility located in Seeb, in 
						2011 has taken a giant stride towards this direction. 
						Looking to set new bench marks in the private Healthcare 
						sector, the hospital aims to reduce the dependence of 
						Omanis and expats on hospitals abroad for high quality 
						treatment. “If you are capable of providing quality 
						service with impressive infrastructure, there is a huge 
						potential in the private sector,” says K Jayan, general 
						manager, Starcare Hospital. “Considering this, we now 
						plan to set up a 200-bed hospital offering tertiary care 
						in a number of specialties such as cardiac surgery, 
						cancer surgery etc. The facility will be affordable to 
						most Omanis and expats because we will have different 
						schemes catering to people belonging to different 
						financial segments. The discussions are on and the 
						location of this RO20-25mn project will be finalised in 
						the next few months.”<br>
						<br>
						<b>Sophisticated and world-class</b><br>
						The current facility in Seeb reflects well the 
						innovative ideas and ambitious plans Starcare holds in 
						store for transforming the healthcare sector in the 
						country in the future. Having embraced international 
						accreditation standards from the design stage itself, 
						Starcare has invested as many as RO3.5mn for the 
						interior and medical equipment which includes the huge 
						investment for the modern and high-tech modular 
						operating theatre. Citing another record of delivery on 
						promises of the team, Jayan says, “As far as we are 
						aware, nowhere in the GCC was the project of a hospital 
						of this size conceived and completed in just 363 days.”<br>
						Being the first private hospital in Seeb, Starcare 
						boasts of a dedicated 24-hour emergency department, 35 
						medical specialties, ICUs, day care units, maternity 
						ward, 24-hour pharmacy, and 24-hour diagnostic services. 
						Other facilities and services at Starcare Hospital 
						include well designed and well equipped trauma and 
						emergency department, multi slice CT Scan, 4D 
						ultrasound, TMT,ECHO and PACS, spacious VIP suites, 
						labour and delivery suites with world best Hill ROM 
						Infinity four multifunction beds. The hospital also has 
						neonatal ICU with German and Dutch technology, three 
						advanced operating rooms with HEPA filters and Laminar 
						Flow systems, comprehensive central sterilisation unit 
						conforming to HTM 2020 (UK) guidelines and advanced 
						laboratory and blood bank. “Although we do have a few 
						private hospitals now in Oman, the typical hospital 
						level service which we call secondary or tertiary level 
						is still in infancy. Some of the private hospitals are 
						large polyclinics with very limited inpatient care 
						facilities. This causes confusion among the public who 
						might lose confidence in the private sector. Starcare is 
						looking to lead a change in this mindset by providing 
						quality secondary and tertiary surgical services,” says 
						Dr Askar Kukkadi, senior consultant paediatrician and 
						medical director. <br>
						<br>
						Designed, and operating from day one, according to the 
						US based Joint Commission International (JCI) 
						accreditation standards, the hospital is currently 
						undergoing rigorous inspection from the accreditation 
						body. “Right now we don’t have any public or private 
						hospital in the Sultanate accredited by the JCI. The 
						accreditation is all about improving the quality of 
						patient care in the hospital. It hinges on more than 
						1000 standards ranging from how you design the operation 
						theatre to how do you prevent mistakes in blood tests. 
						Even though it is a huge challenge to train a lot of 
						people within a short span of time, it is satisfying to 
						see the improvement in quality as we prepare ourselves 
						for the accreditation survey. If successful, Starcare 
						will be one of a few hospitals in the world getting JCI 
						accreditation within the first year of opening,” says 
						Jayan.<br>
						<br>
						<b>A competent team</b> <br>
						Starcare enjoys the services of several fulltime senior 
						in-house consultants including western experienced 
						surgeons, pediatricians, gastroenterologists and 
						cardiologists. In addition, the hospital avails the 
						services of a number of senior visiting consultants from 
						various government hospitals in the country and 
						international visiting consultants. The hospital now 
						offers 35 different specialties handled by a combination 
						of fulltime and visiting consultants. Joint replacement 
						surgery, major reconstructive plastic surgery, Surgery 
						on blood vessels, advanced ENT surgery and laparoscopic 
						surgery are some of the tertiary specialties offered. 
						“We will be shortly launching Bariatric surgery (for 
						obesity), Sports medicine and spine surgery services,” 
						says Dr Kukkadi.<br>
						Referring to the overwhelming response the Starcare 
						gets, Jayan says, “The response was beyond our 
						expectation. Within six months of opening, we have 
						started treating every day such a large number of 
						patients that most of the hospitals could get only after 
						two years. The location in Seeb which has a high 
						population density also helped. But we seem to be 
						getting patients from all over Muscat and even from 
						Sohar, Salalah, Sur and Nizwa. Except for cardiac and 
						cranial surgery the hospital has the facilities to 
						handle most of the medical conditions. Gynecology 
						department is already one of the most successful in the 
						country. We are handling a number of deliveries, 
						caesarean and laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. Our 
						ENT and gastroenterology departments are very strong 
						with senior consultants. We also did a number of knee 
						replacement surgeries.”<br>
						<br>
						“Being accepted by the patients early is very satisfying 
						for us. It is even sweeter now that we are profitable 
						too. Financial viability is very important while trying 
						to offer high quality service at affordable prices” says 
						Dr Kukkadi. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Hospitality par excellence</b> <br>
						The Starcare also seeks to create a warm 
						customer-friendly ambience to ensure that patients get 
						personalised customer service from the moment they reach 
						the hospital. “People coming here are happy because of 
						the hygienic, warm and fresh ambience. Our doctors are 
						encouraged not to consult more than 25 to 30 patients a 
						day. Patients will feel more confident if doctors can 
						give adequate time to listen to their concerns. 
						Unfortunately many hospitals force doctors to treat 60 – 
						80 patients or even more a day, which is really sad,” 
						avers Jayan.<br>
						<br>
						Western or equivalent trained nurses with exceptional 
						bedside manners and high level competence provide 
						quality nursing care for the patients. “We will be 
						committed to provide the best quality medical care and 
						services to our patients through our focus on 
						uncompromising patient safety culture and emphasis on 
						human values”, says Marianna Kotze, chief nursing 
						officer. “ Ours is a holistic approach to nursing 
						combining high quality customer care and high safety for 
						our patients. We have qualified and western experienced 
						professionals of diverse nationalities who are picked up 
						through a meticulous, three-tier recruiting process. We 
						give them continuous in-house training which enables 
						them to adapt to the quality level we aspire to 
						maintain, and support our vision and mission. It is the 
						nursing care that distinguishes between a good hospital 
						and a great hospital.” <br>
						<br>
						Apart from its various upcoming projects in the 
						Sultanate including clinics and a chain of pharmacies, 
						Starcare Health Systems plans to enter the healthcare 
						sector in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE in the near 
						future. It also seeks to expand the operation to India 
						where it is looking to set up various hospitals and 
						pharmacies.&#8194;<br>

				<b>Dr What has the impact of the Eurozone crisis been on the 
				MENA region? </b><br>
				The impact of the Eurozone crisis has been limited on the MENA 
				region. We have had our own difficulties in 2011 like the 
				political unrest during the first months of the year and this 
				had a major bearing on the private sector’s confidence. Overall, 
				the sentiment is getting more risk averse, so when the Eurozone 
				crisis came about we were already coming off a muted base. When 
				I compare the Eurozone crisis of 2008 and 2011, I am more 
				confident this time around, because the region feels less 
				vulnerable. There were a lot of bubbles in 2008, but now there 
				are few excesses and that gives me a lot of confidence; 
				governments understand the necessity of spending aggressively 
				where they can in the changed environment and that is a healthy 
				sign. Nonetheless, the slowdown in the West is having an impact 
				as they are our trade partners; the demand for oil and non oil 
				goods has weakened and I am particularly concerned about access 
				to capital, because we depend upon international capital, 
				whether it is from the international bond market, loan market or 
				funding from European banks, and such funding is going to get 
				more difficult and costly in future. <br>
				<br>
				<b>You spoke about the higher cost of funding in the wake of the 
				Eurozone crisis. Have interest rates started moving up?</b><br>
				Not really. Policy rates are almost zero, though I do not think 
				that anyone can borrow at zero interest rates. There is a degree 
				of risk aversion running across the banking sector. In Oman the 
				banking sector has performed reasonably well and there has been 
				some growth in the volume of credit; the same is true for Saudi 
				Arabia and Qatar. I am more anxious about places like the UAE, 
				where there has always been a higher dependence on foreign 
				funding in the banking sector. This comes on the back of a 
				scenario where liquidity looks stretched and rates are under 
				pressure and this may rise further in 2012. <br>
				<br>
				<b>The global economic slowdown predicates the fact that the 
				demand for oil may go down in these parts of the world. Is that 
				a real threat or will the enhanced demand from emerging 
				countries offset that threat?</b><br>
				When I look around I am a bit confused as to why the prices of 
				every other commodity such as copper, food etc have fallen but 
				oil prices have remained rock solid at $105-$110 per barrel. I 
				can see these prices weakening in 2012. If oil prices have 
				remained high despite Europe and the US being in trouble, it 
				makes it abundantly clear that it’s Asia and the emerging 
				markets that have kept energy prices high. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What has been the economic fallout of the events that have 
				taken place in the MENA region?</b><br>
				The impact varies in different parts of the region. In Egypt and 
				Libya the consequences have been severe and we are quite some 
				way from a return to normal economic activity. In the GCC the 
				impact has been less marked because the unrest has been 
				contained, institutions have held up better, but even here the 
				private sector has looked nervous. International investors that 
				are not committed to the region have been deterred by the 
				problems that they have seen elsewhere. My real worry is the 
				impact of the unrest in deterring governments from economic 
				reforms; there is much less appetite for economic change now 
				than what I saw five or 10 years ago. The decision to increase 
				public spending and salaries run contrary to the goal of 
				increasing the national participation of the private sector, 
				encouraging diversification and that troubles me. This is 
				particularly disturbing because the experience of the last one 
				year shows that the economic models being practiced in the 
				region are simply not delivering the growth, employment 
				opportunities or welfare to meet the demographic pressures that 
				the region faces. The case for economic change is much more 
				stronger than it has ever been. <br>
				<br>
				<b>If you were to do a country wise analysis where do you they 
				stand in terms of economic challenges? Are countries in the GCC 
				region not in the same boat as the other in the MENA region?</b><br>
				The wealth at their disposal makes it easier for countries in 
				the GCC to keep their economic models going on for longer, but 
				even in the GCC smaller oil producers like Oman and Bahrain 
				there are strains that are showing. There is strong unemployment 
				despite a good run of three digit oil prices, which clearly 
				shows that there is something that is clearly not working. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What are the changes in economic policy that you would like 
				to see in these countries?</b><br>
				I have a long shopping list of changes to recommend. There needs 
				to be capital market reforms across the region as there is an 
				over dependence on banking credit. Our equity markets are 
				limited and there is no credit market, there is no domestic debt 
				market and we have a very limited dollar market. So when bank 
				credit is difficult to get as now, then it is very difficult for 
				the private sector to access funding. In many cases we have the 
				laws that are needed but transparency is very limited; 
				confidence in the legal and judicial system (not here in Oman) 
				across the region is limited and there are concerns around 
				implementation, adherence and transparency issues. In the labour 
				market there is talk about developing the private sector as a 
				source of employment, about nationalising the work forces; but 
				then we increase public sector salaries dramatically, making it 
				difficult for the private sector to attract people and creating 
				a disincentive for nationals to acquire the skills that they 
				need to work successfully in the private sector. We say we want 
				to encourage entrepreneurialism but then we make it a criminal 
				offence to go bankrupt. If you bounce a cheque and go to jail 
				then you may not go out and take the kind of risks as you may in 
				the US or Europe, because the consequences are too severe. In 
				fiscal reforms we are reliant on oil revenues, and we need to 
				diversify from oil revenues to encourage more stable public 
				finances and probably we need to introduce more accountable 
				public spending. Our monetary policy is tied to the US. The US 
				is broken, but we are letting Washington set interest rates and 
				the list goes on, but none of these issues are new and policy 
				makers are aware of this, but the experience of the past year 
				makes it imperative to focus on these areas of structural 
				reforms. <br>
				<br>
				<b>You believe that the economic structures created in the 1970s 
				are not capable of taking on the challenges of the 21st century. 
				This is quite a admonition, what makes you so critical of these 
				institutions and structures?</b><br>
				The growth in the GCC in the last 10 years has averaged 4-4.5 
				per cent even though the price of our core commodity – oil has 
				increased five-fold. The region has been the biggest beneficiary 
				of the revaluation of commodities but our growth rates are 
				running 2.5 per cent below emerging markets average. Why is this 
				so? Why do we have substantial youth employment? Big commodity 
				states which should have been beneficiaries of high oil prices 
				and their failure to generate rapid economic growth clearly 
				reflects a need for structural changes in economic structures of 
				the past. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Can you do some crystal gazing on 2012 and what it holds in 
				store for the region and businesses? </b><br>
				My growth rates for most of the region hover between 3.5-4.5 per 
				cent. That is a good number, if one were sitting in the US or UK 
				one would be delighted by these statistics, but this is below 
				potential for the GCC as a whole including Oman. These economies 
				are six to seven percentage growth stories and there is massive 
				catch up growth potential that needs to be realised. My big 
				worry is that the primary driver of growth continues to be 
				public sector spending and the private sectors activity is far 
				more muted.<br>

				<br>
                		It is not often that the prime minister of any country 
						starts choking back tears during a press conference. But 
						on 9 August 1965, Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister of 
						Singapore was doing just that. What was getting Lee so 
						down? A concept that economics professors explain on the 
						first day of class: scarcity.<br>
						<br>
						Singapore, an island slightly smaller than Bahrain, had 
						just been expelled from its union with Malaysia. The 
						newly declared Republic of Singapore, severed from the 
						rest of Malaysia, had virtually zero natural resources, 
						yet it needed to house, educate and employ its 1.9 
						million people, all while defending its fragile 
						sovereignty in a changing region. <br>
						<br>
						One could hardly blame the leader for getting emotional.<br>
						The scarcity that Singapore faced, however, turned out 
						to be a blessing of sorts. In the absence of 
						conventional natural resources, the country developed 
						its human resources. Over the past 55 years, the 
						city-state moulded an educated workforce that could 
						handle increasingly complex downstream industries and 
						eventually knowledge-based industries. Within one 
						generation, the young republic became one of the richest 
						countries in the world. <br>
						<br>
						When speaking of the GCC, an area well-endowed with 
						hydrocarbons, scarcity is not typically a buzzword. In 
						Oman, however, oil and gas reserves – though plentiful 
						now – are set to deplete more quickly than those of its 
						neighbours. The authorities have long acknowledged this 
						and are looking for ways to diversify the Sultanate’s 
						economy by investing in other sectors. Although these 
						efforts have helped drive growth in a number of 
						industries, many of them, like metallurgy and 
						petrochemicals, indirectly rely on hydrocarbons for 
						low-cost energy and feedstock: foundries need gas to 
						fuel their operations and petrochemicals require oil for 
						primary production.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Mature fields</b><br>
						Lately, a combination of steadily growing consumer 
						demand and an expanding industrial sector have put more 
						pressure on the Sultanate’s maturing gas fields. This 
						consumption in recent years has necessitated imports 
						from Qatar via the Dolphin pipeline. In response, 
						authorities have been investigating ways to decrease 
						demand. Last November, Muscat mulled price increases on 
						gas for industrial customers to better reflect 
						international markets. For industries, however, higher 
						energy prices could shrink profit margins and ultimately 
						slow growth.<br>
						<br>
						One relatively untapped source of energy savings, 
						recycling, might hold some solutions. A number of 
						industries in the Sultanate could benefit from 
						increasing use of recycled materials, which is often 
						less energy-intensive than primary production. In the 
						long run, incorporating more recycled materials in 
						supply lines could lead to cheaper, greener production 
						that preserves increasingly valuable hydrocarbons.<br>
						<br>
						The aluminium industry demonstrates this potential. 
						Primary production has risen steadily in the Sultanate 
						and is set to continue doing so. Last May Sohar 
						Aluminium announced a $3bn investment in a bid to double 
						its output. Since the metal is extremely versatile, 
						downstream industries have been developing in tandem 
						with primary production to serve specific sectors like 
						transport, retail and construction. Oman Aluminium 
						Processing Industries (OAPIL) locally sources its 
						feedstock to make rods and overhead conductors. The firm 
						has plans to double its annual capacity in coming years, 
						Vice-chairman and Managing Director Hussain Salman Al 
						Lawati said at the Arabal conference last November. The 
						company currently produces 48,000 tpa but would like to 
						see that top 100,0000 tpa.<br>
						<br>
						These expansion plans will depend on availability of 
						feedstock, he added. “It depends on how much aluminium 
						Sohar Aluminium can supply. Our expansion will depend on 
						commitments from Sohar and the government for natural 
						gas.” Enter recycling. Oman’s aluminium producers rely 
						on natural gas to fuel the primary production which is 
						highly energy intensive. Creating aluminium from 
						recycled products, on the other hand, requires 95 per 
						cent less energy. Even better, aluminium can also 
						undergo multiple lifecycles without quality loss.<br>
						Although incorporating more recycled aluminium in 
						production lines may require significant upfront 
						investments, industry players see potential for 
						incorporating more recycled materials in the Sultanate. 
						“Recycling has huge benefits for future generations by 
						preserving energy and natural resources,” OAPIL CEO 
						Frederic Rouyer said in a speech at the Arabal 
						conference. “[T]here is clearly a case for looking to 
						develop a sophisticated aluminium recycling industry 
						here in Oman that could benefit all of the GCC 
						smelters.” Indeed, with a few critical shifts, the 
						industry could begin producing at lower costs, 
						preserving energy and, as an added bonus, cutting waste 
						and greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Plastic recyling</b><br>
						Another downstream industry on the up in Oman, PET 
						plastic production, could benefit from recycling as 
						well. PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic is a 
						synthetic material popular for beverage bottles, food 
						containers and product packaging. Although some 
						companies have started finding ways to create the 
						plastic from plant materials, the majority of the 
						plastic is produced from petroleum. Given the GCC’s rich 
						oil reserves, the region has been quick to develop the 
						industry as part of a wider push to increase 
						petrochemicals output. <br>
						<br>
						“The Gulf region’s share of petrochemical and chemical 
						total output is currently 16 per cent, and this will 
						grow to 20 per cent by the year 2015,” Abdualwahab al 
						Sadoun, secretary of the Gulf Petrochemicals &amp; Chemicals 
						Association (GPCA), said at the GPCA’s Supply Conference 
						Chain in June 2011. As part of the diversification plans 
						outlined by the government in Oman Vision 2020, PET 
						production has also grown in Oman. The Salalah-based 
						company OCTAL, for example, produces PET plastic and 
						resin. Founded in 2006, OCTAL has built itself into the 
						region’s largest PET resin manufacturer and the world’ 
						largest integrated PET sheet manufacturer. The company 
						reported $500mn in sales in 2010, the majority of which 
						were shipped overseas, making PET a significant portion 
						Oman’s non-oil exports.<br>
						<br>
						Still, the industry relies on petroleum feedstock for 
						primary production. Since recycling uses post-consumer 
						products as feedstock, using recycled PET does not 
						require the petroleum that would be needed to create new 
						plastic, leaving more oil saved for other purposes. 
						Additionally, creating recycled PET uses 50-70 per cent 
						less energy than primary production. Since virtually all 
						of Oman’s electricity is generated by burning gas, that 
						energy savings translates to gas savings as well.<br>
						<br>
						Of course, Oman’s current resource situation is a far 
						cry from that of Singapore in 1965. By most metrics, its 
						hydrocarbons are still plentiful. However, successful 
						integration of post-consumer production lines could save 
						those energy resources for overseas export, where they 
						can fetch high prices. In the long term, using more 
						recycled materials in industries like aluminium and PET 
						could also allow downstream industries to further wean 
						themselves off their oil and gas dependence. That way, 
						Oman will still be able to capitalise on the industrial 
						expertise and infrastructure it is developing now 
						through conventional production, even if hydrocarbons do 
						become scarcer. Moving forward, these sorts of 
						industries hold untold potential, both to grow the Omani 
						economy and to enlarge the scope of its downstream 
						services.&#8194;<br>

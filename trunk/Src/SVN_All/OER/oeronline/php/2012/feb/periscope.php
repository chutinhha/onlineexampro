				<br>
				The world financial markets were at an inflection point on the 
				eve of 2012. The Eurozone debt crisis threatens a credit crunch 
				as banks are forced to shrink balance sheets even while fiscal 
				austerity rages in Ireland, Britain and the Club Med. The latest 
				EU fiscal discipline pact threatens a split as Britain and 
				Hungary vetoed any treaty change. Meanwhile, ECB President Mario 
				Draghi has initiated a rate cut cycle that does not augur well 
				for the Euro in 2012. The slowdown in China is unmistakable as 
				export orders decline, property prices plunge, GDP growth rates, 
				PMI and retail/auto sales all decelerate. As Chinese growth 
				falls, the Politburo shifted to a soft money bias with Premier 
				Wen’s “need to fine tune policy” edict and the PBOC’s subsequent 
				banking system reserve ration cuts.<br>
				<br>
				Industrial commodities are the natural victims of a Eurozone 
				credit crunch and a China slowdown. This is the reason why 
				product premiums on aluminium, lead, nickel and copper on the 
				London Metal Exchange have plummeted since October. The US 
				economic supertanker, expected to hit an iceberg, has meanwhile 
				accelerated on payroll growth, with the US unemployment rate now 
				down to 8.6 per cent. Economics is not the only macro sword of 
				Damocles on the currency markets. Politics also unsettles Wall 
				Street. The Arab spring has led to the overthrow of four regimes 
				in the Middle East. Violence in Syria continues to escalate. EU 
				and US sanctions against Iran tighten and raise supply 
				shock/geopolitical risk in the crude oil markets.<br>
				<br>
				As I read the macro tea leaves (or coffee beans, since we live 
				in the Gulf!), it is clear to me that 2012 will be the year the 
				US dollar makes a major move higher. Why? One, the Bernanke Fed 
				has no reason to ease policy any more while the ECB has begun 
				its rate cycle. Two, private sector deleveraging in Western 
				Europe has only just begun. This is negative for global 
				liquidity and asset volatility will creep higher. These trends 
				are hugely dollar positive. Three, the European banking system 
				faces systemic credit issues (e.g. Commerzbank, the Greek 
				banking system , French bank derivatives exposure) while the US 
				money centre banks have largely recovered from the Wall Street 
				Armageddon of 2008.<br>
				<br>
				Four, international politics in the Middle East could well take 
				an ugly turn in Israel, the Gulf or Syria. This will lead to a 
				spike in the Chicago Volatility Index (VIX) and safe haven flows 
				into the US dollar. The SNB has devalued the Swiss franc’s safe 
				haven role with is Euro-Swiss franc FX peg. The Japanese yen is 
				also a dubious safe haven because the Bank of Japan intervenes 
				to protect Japan Inc exporters, the public sector debt is a 
				shocking 200 per cent of GDP and the post-Fukushima current 
				account surplus has shrink. Five, a credit crunch in 
				international interbank markets has begun. Several European 
				money centre banks have slashed country credit line in the GCC.<br>
				<br>
				This means a rise in bank funding costs and tighter, even 
				sluggish loan growth. Three month dollar LIBOR rates have 
				doubled since July. This is an augury of a higher dollar as many 
				European banks, desperate for dollar funding, will be forced to 
				buy greenbacks in the spot FX market.<br>
				<br>
				Six, the Euro will remain weak all year as the ECB abandons 
				monetary policy and embraces QE. The Euro, after all, 
				constitutes 57 per cent of the Dollar Index. Seven, as banks 
				retreat from cross-border trading, globalization of finance will 
				decline. This will make financial markets illiquid and volatile. 
				This means risk appetite will remain low and the VIX will remain 
				higher. Carry trades will be punished, particularly in the 
				emerging markets. Long Indian rupee trades financed by dollar 
				borrowing were a disaster in 2011, after all. These market 
				trends all suggest a higher dollar. Eight, by most valuation 
				metrics, the US dollar is grossly undervalued. This was not the 
				case in the 1970’s inflation malaise or in the late 1990’s 
				Silicon Valley tech bubble. Yet the dollar is now the natural 
				safe haven for macro stresses in global finance.<br>
				<br>
				Specific strategic shorts? I believe the Australian dollar will 
				plummet in 2012 as the RBA slashes interest rates. Australian 
				households are hugely leveraged at 160 per cent debt to income 
				ratios at a time when property prices Down Under have begun to 
				drop.<br>
				<br>
				Moreover, the fall in Chinese GDP demand is a disaster for 
				Aussie mining capex and metals exports. The Aussie/yen trade is 
				an accident waiting to happen as its catalysts are retail 
				leveraged Japanese investors, the proverbial Watanabe-san. I 
				believe the Aussie dollar will fall below its current 1.03 
				levels to 0.88 against the dollar in the first six months of 
				2012. Bottom fishing in emerging markets is also as dangerous as 
				disco dancing on minefields if King Dollar makes its big move, 
				as I am convinced it will in 2012.&#8194;<br>

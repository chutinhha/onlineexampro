					Professor 
					Abdallah S Daar, ex-professor and head of the department of 
					surgery at Sultan Qaboos University, is now on a global 
					mission to transform lives in the developing world using 
					advances made in global health. In a revelatory book, called 
					The Grandest Challenge, co-authored with Peter Singer, 
					another distinguished scientist, Prof Daar writes that every 
					person’s life is of equal value, regardless of where he or 
					she is born or lives in this world. The book argues that the 
					revolution in biotechnology can save millions of lives but 
					only if we find a way to bring knowledge and treatments out 
					of state-of-the-art labs and into the world’s most remote 
					villages.<br>

					International Institute for Global Health. He was the 
					founding chair of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases.

					Excerpts from an interview with Visvas Paul D Karra:<br>
					<br>
					<b>What was the inspiration behind writing the book The 
					Grandest Challenge?</b><br>
					The world does not know how unequal it is and the 
					disparities that exist, particularly in health. And there is 
					a link between health and income - they reinforce each 
					other. How is it possible to improve the situation using 
					modern science and technology? My colleague Dr Peter Singer 
					and I have worked very closely and over the past 10-12 years 
					have developed a programme in Toronto which has been very 
					successful both in terms of coming up with new ideas and 
					support to get research funding. This is the first book I 
					have written that is aimed at the public rather than 
					professionals. It aims, among others, to inspire young 
					people to be more aware of what they could do to change the 
					world and make a difference both by advocacy and also 
					finding their own entry points into wide area of global 
					health.<br>
					<br>
					<b>What is the best way for an Omani individual to enter 
					into this innovative field?</b><br>
					In Oman, we should have better global public health 
					education. We have good medical schools but they are not yet 
					connected to the larger world and none of them are focused 
					on how to make a serious contribution to the health and 
					welfare of the rest of the world, and especially the poor. 
					But they can make a difference. There is a beautiful example 
					of His Excellency Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, the minister 
					responsible for foreign affairs, investing $1mn in a 
					bio-tech company known as Shantha Biotechnics in Hyderabad, 
					India. That biotech company developed a vaccine against 
					Hepatitis B bringing down the cost by a huge margin – from 
					$20-25 per shot to less than $1 initially and later to about 
					35 cents. That company is among the largest suppliers of 
					this vaccine to UNICEF and millions of children are now 
					getting the benefit out of it from the initial investment of 
					1mn. The company was valued at $600mn a few years ago. The 
					Hepatitis B vaccine has been in existence since 1969 but 
					wasn’t available to the developing countries until Shantha 
					developed it and made it affordable. The challenge isn’t 
					just about developing such vaccines but also to reach out to 
					the needy. We need health insurance schemes for the poor 
					that would be more affordable.<br>
					<br>
					Talent, ingenuity and the ability to innovate do not know 
					any borders. What is important is to identify them, and 
					provide an environment for their productive expression. 
					There is a proposal to build a science city here in Oman. 
					This is a great opportunity to harness and unleash Oman’s 
					creative potential, in addition to help build public 
					awareness of the value of ethical science to society.<br>
					<br>
					The book also talks about frugal low-cost, efficient health 
					care delivery systems that we, and even the wealthy 
					countries, can all learn from. Take for example the Aravind 
					eye-care system in Madurai, India. They have a few clinics 
					around and they do as many eye care surgeries in one year as 
					the whole of Canada and their results are better than that 
					of the National Health Service of the UK. Yet remarkably 
					Aravind does all this at one hundredth of the cost of the UK 
					while treating half of all their patients for free because 
					they are poor; and at the end of the year they get a profit 
					which they plough back into the system since it is a 
					non-profit organisation. So in the book we highlight the 
					importance of not only north-south flow of knowledge but 
					also south-north and south-south learning. <br>
					<br>
					<b>What makes your book different from others on the same 
					subject?</b><br>
					In our centre in Toronto we have developed a niche which is 
					at the intersection between global health, life sciences 
					(biotechnology) and entrepreneurship. The book is informed 
					by this approach and also by what we call integrated 
					innovation i.e innovation in science/technology but coupled 
					with social and business innovation. Our book covers these 
					issues in a narrative form, with many intriguing stories and 
					events. To our knowledge this is the first book to do this. 
					We also narrate stories of how we came to work with funding 
					organisations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and 
					the work we still do with them. We have also now evolved 
					into being a research funding organisation, Grand Challenges 
					Canada, which focuses on funding great researchers in low 
					income countries who have great ideas.<br>
					<br>
					<b>You have brought out different ideas in your book, but 
					what exactly is the road map? Who will benefit from the 
					ideas you have discussed and how?</b><br>
					First of all, people like reading about exciting new 
					developments. A few years ago a book similar to ours, Thomas 
					Friedman’s bestseller’s The World is Flat talked about 
					information and communication technology (ICT). Today India 
					is just as good as the US – very connected. We argue that 
					the world has also become flat in terms of innovation, 
					creating wealth and making an impact on society through life 
					sciences and global health innovation. But interestingly, 
					ICT and life sciences are now converging. We also aim to get 
					students interested in global health, identify their own 
					entry points in this wide field, and make them compassionate 
					agents of change who are aware of the rationale for mutual 
					caring. The book might also help investors think beyond the 
					obvious. <br>
					<br>
					The book is also full of stories that take place in many 
					countries and this might inspire people to travel more and 
					more purposefully. A person could say, “I haven’t travelled 
					to this particular place and I don’t know how a particular 
					concept works so let me go there and see it myself”. They 
					could visit, for example, a hugely successful company in 
					Arusha, Tanzania, called “A to Z”. This company, which 
					employs about 7000 people, mostly women, manufactures about 
					30 million insecticide impregnated bed nets. These bed nets 
					have dramatically reduced the mortality rate of children 
					from malaria. They might thus become better global citizens, 
					in addition to being Omani citizens.<br>
					<br>
					We don’t realise how much innovation exists in the 
					developing world. In wealthy countries we cannot survive on 
					less than a dollar a day, because even a cup of coffee costs 
					more. But there are about a billion people who survive on a 
					dollar less than a day and about 2.7 billion who survive on 
					less than 2 dollars. To do so that you really need to be 
					innovative, creative and ingenious. In The Grandest 
					Challenge we discuss the ways and mechanisms of harnessing 
					and unleashing these ideas to bridge knowledge, health and 
					power gaps.<br>
					<br>
					You have talked about taking labs to the villages and 
					‘flattening’ the world in its true sense. Can you give us a 
					real life experience of success in this drive?<br>
					Let me start with a story of a failure. A professor called 
					Moses Musaazi from Uganda developed an ingenious incinerator 
					for burning medical waste that doesn’t require any fuel 
					other than the medical waste itself. He has got a prototype. 
					But unfortunately he has got no way of taking his idea 
					forward. There is no efficient system for him to protect his 
					innovation. He has no mentors to help him with 
					commercialisation. There is no venture funding. So his 
					technology is stagnant.<br>
					<br>
					A success story is ‘A to Z’ that I spoke about earlier. A 
					textile company in Tanzania that used to be a tiny factory 
					producing t-shirts and hats. One day someone from the World 
					Health Organisation (WHO) and a Tanzanian scientist called 
					Hassan Mshinde visited them and another company and said 
					they had some evidence that impregnating insecticide into 
					bed nets would stop kids dying from malaria, and asked 
					whether these companies are interested. The other company 
					declined but ‘A to Z’ agreed and the rest is history.<br>
					<br>
					The book describes the real ethical, regulatory and 
					political challenges facing researchers and companies as 
					they develop ideas, do research and develop and 
					commercialise their products. Yet it is a profoundly 
					optimistic book, full of examples of how these challenges 
					are and can be overcome. A great example of this is the 
					story we tell of HE Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah and Shantha 
					Biotechnics. There are many others we talk about in the 
					book. <br>
					<br>
					That kind of smart learning, collaboration and investing can 
					happen in any direction. Look what’s happening in India, 
					which is transforming itself from a ‘copycat’ nation in 
					terms of innovation to a truly innovating nation. It 
					initially started with ICT and now moved on to biotech and 
					pharmaceuticals. So if it’s possible in India, it could be 
					possible in Pakistan, Nigeria or Ghana. Most of the oil for 
					US comes from Africa rather than the Middle East. Africa is 
					a rising star. Countries there are beginning to invest 
					seriously in science and technology and training of human 
					resources. The opportunities of the future lie in Africa, 
					Latin America, India and China.<br>
					<br>
					<b>As the ex-Professor and Head of Dept of Surgery at Sultan 
					Qaboos University, can you give us your outlook on Oman’s 
					health system?</b><br>
					Oman has actually got a relatively good health care system, 
					although of course it can always get better. Oman is a long 
					way away from investing in health to the same extent as, 
					say, the UK or Canada in terms of percentage of GDP. 
					Nevertheless, a few years ago Oman was ranked by the World 
					Health Organisation as No.1 in the world in terms of how 
					much health value you get on a dollar spent on health. Since 
					then there has been huge improvements in the healthcare 
					system at the tertiary end, mainly in the Muscat region. We 
					now have not only high powered care like kidney and 
					bone-marrow transplants, but also open heart surgery. We 
					performed the first kidney transplant nearly 20 years ago. 
					Oman holds two world records for performing the youngest 
					kidney transplant in history. Furthermore, private sector 
					healthcare is also growing. However, talking to young Omani 
					doctors recently I was told that away from Muscat the 
					situation is not so rosy. So there is work to be done there 
					to improve things. Investing in health is investing in 
					wealth. Some economically developed countries spend in 
					excess of $5000 per capita per annum on health, constituting 
					more than 10 per cent of GDP (the US spends 17-18 per cent, 
					but a lot of that is wasted). But poor countries in 
					sub-Saharan Africa spend as little as 15 to 20 dollars per 
					capita. <br>
					<br>
					<b>What are the major discoveries in biotechnology?</b><br>
					Genomics in the long term would make our approach to medical 
					care more personalised and preventive. It has also allowed 
					us to look at the genetic make-up of viruses, bacteria and 
					parasites so we can intelligently develop drugs and vaccines 
					against them. It has also enabled us to understand 
					mosquitoes that carry those parasites like malaria and 
					develop ways to stop them from transmitting those diseases. 
					A major breakthrough is that until now we haven’t had a 
					malaria vaccine but there is now going to be one in 2016 and 
					others will follow. I believe that in 10 to 15 years, 
					malaria will not be such a big killer of children.<br>

				authorities have at their disposal a notable $30bn for 
				investment purposes in 2012 alone<br>
				<br>
				By Dr Jasim Husain Ali</b><br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Qatar is a rising global star in numerous aspects including its 
				investment strategy. One proof of that is the selection of Qatar 
				as the host of the World Cup 2022, for the first time ever in 
				the Middle East and North African region.It is possibly fair to 
				link this achievement, at least partially, to the country’s 
				active and visible investment drive on the world scene.<br>
				<br>
				The country’s foreign investment portfolio is sizable on the one 
				hand and diversified enough on the other, and continues to 
				expand into new ventures. It emerged recently that Qatari 
				authorities have at their disposal a notable $30bn for 
				investment purposes in 2012 alone. The figure became known in 
				April when the country played host to the annual meeting of the 
				UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad).<br>
				<br>
				It is understandable why some countries eye a share of the pie. 
				Among other things, foreign direct investments (FDI) have the 
				ability to sustain economic growth and create jobs for locals, 
				something in demand the world over.<br>
				<br>
				By one account the accumulated size of the country’s state 
				wealth fund (SWF) stands at a staggering $100bn. As such, the 
				magnitude of Qatar’s investments worldwide is sizable in 
				relation to other hard facts pertaining to the country. For 
				instance, Qatar’s gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to 
				amount to $197bn in 2012 in nominal terms, not adjusted for 
				inflation, the third largest in the Gulf Cooperation Council 
				(GCC) after Saudi Arabia and the UAE.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Fastest growing economy<br>
				</b>Accordingly, this makes Qatar stand out in the world with 
				regard to foreign investment on a per capita basis. Yet reports 
				issued by the IMF and other credible sources consider Qatar the 
				fastest growing economy among the six-nation entity, suggesting 
				continued strength in the years ahead.<br>
				<br>
				Ever since the inception of the Qatar Investment Authority in 
				2005 as a state wealth fund entity, the country has already 
				created a positive impression in numerous parts of the world. 
				Choices of the diverse investment portfolio entail stakes in 
				banks in Brazil and agricultural development in several 
				countries in Southeast Asia.<br>
				<br>
				Also, Qatar is a major investor in the UK’s retail sector 
				including owning the giant Harrods. Still, Qatar has committed 
				to investing heavily in debt-ridden Greece.<br>
				<br>
				To be sure, the international tendencies of Qatar are an 
				established fact including being a major player in the 
				dissemination of international news via Al Jazeera. It seems 
				Qatar is racing against time to possibly make up for lost 
				potential in past years. Happily, foreign investment is a 
				two-way street phenomenon, a reference to FDI attracted to 
				Qatar.<br>
				<br>
				In fact, the Unctad World Investment Report 2011 regards Qatar 
				as the second largest recipient of FDI among GCC countries. 
				According to the report, Qatar attracted some $5.5bn worth of 
				FDI, second though to $28.5bn invested in Saudi Arabia.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Largest exporter of LNG<br>
				</b>Qatar opened up its energy sector to international firms in 
				the past two decades, thereby promising phenomenal results. In 
				2011, Qatar hit a new milestone by celebrating the achievement 
				of 77 million tonnes per year of liquefied natural gas. 
				Comparatively, production capacity only amounted to 54 million 
				tonnes in 2010. But for a self-imposed moratorium to help 
				maintain prices, output could be further boosted. This explains 
				why Qatar has emerged as the largest exporter of LNG, a position 
				previously held by Indonesia.<br>
				<br>
				In return, the country is using proceeds from the petroleum 
				sector including gas and oil to carry out its investment 
				drive.Qatar presents itself as an exemplary country when it 
				comes to tapping its potential. Clearly, it pays to be an 
				internationally-oriented country.&#8194;<br>

				<b>What are the big trends in a changing world order that 
				investors need to be aware of while making their choices?</b><br>
				The biggest theme for our investors is that a new world order is 
				emerging. Many people simplify it by describing it as the rise 
				of the East and the decline of the West; that might be 
				happening, but this is not what is driving it. What is driving 
				it is a combination of demographic, technological and 
				scientific, economic, ecological and social change. When you put 
				these five factors together then the real story about this 
				emerging world order becomes clear. It has never been so 
				important to understand the real idea of sustainable development 
				and when I say sustainable development it means preparing your 
				society at a national level, business level and at the 
				individual level for the next 1,000 years and that implies that 
				you just cannot cut corners. That means you cannot turn a blind 
				eye on factors that have an adverse impact on nature and other 
				social stakeholders. Countries and companies need to run in a 
				first class sustainable way and that is what is going to 
				determine whether the next decade is going to belong to India or 
				to China or to Brazil or Oman. Taking this a step further also 
				means that a new investment paradigm is emerging, because as an 
				investor you need to embrace the future and not run behind it, 
				you need to pick companies and states on the basis of the 
				sustainability criteria – does a company run a sustainable 
				business model while also factorising other fundamentals like 
				whether it is attractively valued etc. That’s the difference 
				between today and ten years ago. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Investors are told to choose from companies spreading across 
				countries and the same holds true for various asset classes. 
				Does this make investing more difficult for a lay investor?</b>
				<br>
				This is one area that we have invested in for the last 20 years 
				providing research, advice and investment solutions for the long 
				term. We invest in companies that invest for the long term and 
				run sustainable businesses. You are right, investing was always 
				difficult and it was always advisable to have a good trustworthy 
				investment advisor; in a new order one requires a different sort 
				of advice. As the investment paradigm changes it is also 
				important that one challenges ones investment advisor on whether 
				he understands this paradigm and whether he can provide the 
				depth and breath for it. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Where should one invest in a new order as there are a lot of 
				contradictory views emanating. Some say that the US is 
				recovering slowly, Eurozone seems to be in crisis, China is 
				slowing down and India has its own set of problems?</b><br>
				The world economy is in a better shape than what people claim 
				that it is. The US is clearly turning around and there is no 
				question about that, China is not in free fall as it is just 
				shifting its growth model from being export-led to being 
				domestic driven. Foxconn has recently had to double salaries for 
				its 500,000 employees; now that will cause some sort of a growth 
				slowdown in the short term, but these 500,000 employees will 
				also go out and buy the iPods that they produce in the medium 
				term. So there are two sides to every story. Europe is following 
				and there is nothing new about that as that has always been the 
				case. When I look at the world I think that all the analysts 
				have been extremely bearish in the beginning of this year, but 
				what I see is that the world economy has never been a perfect 
				place. This year will be a Goldilocks year for investors because 
				of a combination of factors – an improvement in the economic 
				picture, no increase in interest rates plus you have an enormous 
				wall of liquidity which represents investors’ scepticism, as 
				they say on Wall Street every bull market has to climb the high 
				wall of worry. The wall of worry is the wall of money. So you 
				really have an ideal year in 2012 that favours risk takers and 
				equity investors. The year will end in solid double digit 
				returns for equity investors. In terms of regions, emerging 
				markets are cheaper than the US and they have better growth 
				momentum. Europe is very unloved and that makes it cheaper and 
				also quite attractive. Add to that the sustainability factor 
				when you come down to stock selection and you get a world class 
				portfolio.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is your take on emerging markets and where do you think 
				countries in the GCC, China, Brazil and India are headed 
				towards? </b><br>
				Oman and the Gulf states are an attractive buying opportunity 
				for both domestic and international investors. The catalysts for 
				strong performance that I anticipate will be high oil prices and 
				a global recovery that translates nicely into the GCC economies 
				and my strong conviction is that the bottom of the real estate 
				market is behind us and that the supply demand imbalances are 
				narrowing. GCC markets have been underperformers compared to 
				other emerging countries but that is one of the reasons why I 
				find them to be attractive; they are at very cheap valuations 
				and the companies which are being traded are very solid, so 
				there are strong growth opportunities. If one were to talk about 
				sectors then I would pick banks across the GCC region, as they 
				have been the most unloved in the past year and they will 
				benefit most from the turnaround. Apart from this one should be 
				close to the oil and gas sector.<br>
				<br>
				China is not in free fall; the government explained this last 
				year when they put out their five year plan. They are seeking to 
				move towards a new economic model, which has been modelled after 
				Scandinavian countries – one that is very inclusive, a social, 
				free market economy, driven by innovation rather than cheap 
				labour and one that will be based on domestic rather than 
				external demand. It should be clear to everyone that such a 
				shift does not come without friction. As China is facing a 
				period of solid political tension and as it has one of the most 
				powerful Central Banks in the world, the latter will use its 
				full authority to see that the Chinese economy does not tank. It 
				will slow and there will be some collateral damage, but you will 
				see domestic demand picking up.<br>
				<br>
				Brazil is as good as it has ever been; the great potential that 
				Latin America enjoys is that as and when they open up their 
				region to intra-market trade they can multiply their 
				productivity. India is the most promising economy in the world 
				as it has the most entrepreneurial genes, if only it did not 
				have a government that keeps shooting itself in its foot. India 
				is the biggest democracy in the world but it also has more red 
				tape and regulation. When it can firmly deal with them, when it 
				gets there, India will overtake China in terms of growth and 
				GDP. <br>
				<br>
				<b>A lot has been written about commodities and their continuing 
				good run. How should investors approach this market? </b><br>
				Commodities have only one way to go – higher for longer and it 
				is driven by arguments both on the supply and the demand side. 
				Let’s start on the supply side. The great narrative that oil 
				countries like Saudi Arabia and other have put out is that the 
				more you invest in your upstream exploration production 
				infrastructure, the more oil you produce. This has been more of 
				fiction rather than fact, because despite huge investments these 
				countries are producing, not more than what was being produced 
				10 years ago. The supply side suffers from a number of 
				bottlenecks in terms of availability or access and the demand 
				side continues to grow and it will continue to grow 
				exponentially, because of demographic and economic growth. Oil 
				prices will go to $150 and above in the next 12 months. 
				Investors are advised to remain invested (at least 10 per cent 
				of their portfolio) in a diversified commodity fund at all 
				times. Gold will go to $2,500 in the next two years as it has 
				become cheaper and thereby more attractive. Gold is not a 
				reflection on inflation but a reflection on fiscal 
				irresponsibility and that is something that will remain with us 
				for the next couple of years as governments in the West muddle 
				their way through the mess that they have got themselves into.</td>

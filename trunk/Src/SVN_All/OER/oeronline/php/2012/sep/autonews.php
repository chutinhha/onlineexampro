				The original Golf GTI was planned as a limited series of 5,000 
				cars. Since then – and five generations of GTI later – more than 
				1.7 million have been sold worldwide. The sharp dynamics, a 
				responsive four-cylinder engine and driver involvement are still 
				at the core of the Mark VI GTI. Yet it has evolved – the Mk VI 
				is faster and more powerful than any standard GTI before it. 
				However, the day-to-day usability of the GTI has not been 
				forgotten and it is cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever 
				before. An advanced 2.0-litre TSI engine producing 210hp, linked 
				to a six-speed DSG gearbox, is at the heart of the GTI. Despite 
				the immense power output, the GTI is assured of greater grip in 
				all conditions thanks to the standard XDS electronic control of 
				front wheel traction.<br>

				The 2012 Dodge Durango is one of the best family-oriented SUVs 
				on the market today and Dhofar Automotive’s Ramadan promotion 
				has raised the bar once again for its value in the seven-seat 
				SUV segment. With its four-wheel independent suspension, near 
				50:50 weight distribution and responsive steering and handling, 
				Durango has driving dynamics unlike what you typically find in a 
				sport-utility vehicle (SUV). The new Dodge Durango’s distinctive 
				bold Dodge design craftily houses a spacious three-row seating 
				arrangement for seven-passengers. Passengers will also feel 
				materials that are soft to the touch and an interior that is 
				refined with a functionality that gives owners a first-class 
				experience. The Durango’s interior is also extremely comfortable 
				for all three rows of passengers making it perfect for a long 
				drives with the entire family. And with more than 30 storage 
				areas, 28 seating configurations and a rear cargo area of nearly 
				85 cubic feet; there’s a surprising amount of interior 
				flexibility. The Durango also features more than 45 safety 
				features.</font><p align="center" style="margin: 10px; ">

                With the new CLS Shooting Brake, Mercedes-Benz is once again 
				setting an example when it comes to creativity of design, and as 
				such highlighting its leading role in this area: in terms of its 
				proportions, the new CLS is quite clearly a coupé, but with five 
				doors and a roof which continues through to the rear, it 
				promises some remarkable new possibilities encapsulated in a 
				stunning form. The idea of the four-door coupé – successfully 
				introduced in 2004 with the first CLS and long imitated in the 
				meantime – has now been taken to new heights and to innovative 
				effect. The result is automotive independence at its most 
				beautiful. The proportions of the CLS Shooting Brake are 
				surprising but clearly those of a coupé, and create a basic 
				stance which makes it look ready for the off: the long bonnet, 
				narrow-look windows with frameless side windows, and dynamic 
				roof sloping back towards the rear. It is only when taking a 
				second look that it becomes clear that the Shooting Break 
				actually has five doors and offers “more” in terms of function. 
				In essence it represents an unprecedented version of a sports 
				car with five seats and a large tailgate. It is a special 
				proposition for people looking to differentiate themselves from 
				the mainstream.</font></td>

				As the countdown to the BizPro Awards 2012, to be held on May 
				20, 2012, gets underway OER catches up with a couple of winners 
				of yesteryears to get a ring side view on the awards and its 
				salience in promoting and encouraging young Omani’s. A report<p align="center" class="style13">

				Abdulnasir N Al Raisi, Assistant General Manager, Corporate 
				Credit &amp; Marketing, BankMuscat and the recipient of the Young 
				Achiever Award in 2009, shares his thoughts on winning the 
				Award. Excerpts from an interview with Mayank Singh.<br>
				<br>
				You were one of the winners in the Young Achievers category at 
				BizPro Awards in 2009, and since then you have gone onto excel 
				in your job and related areas. Looking back, what were the 
				attributes that enabled you to win this coveted recognition? <br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/education-may-12-2.jpg" width="150" height="225" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="3">I 
				have always believed in doing the best that one can. A person 
				should look around to see what others are doing and then try to 
				better that, because if you are not doing anything differently 
				then it is difficult to stand out in a crowd. I am lucky to be 
				associated with a bank which stresses on local talent, but going 
				up the corporate ladder requires hard work. Success is also the 
				combination of a number of other things like good colleagues, 
				encouraging superiors etc. But it is important to get your 
				priorities straight. Winning the BizPro Young Achiever Award was 
				an achievement for me and a step in the right direction. The 
				testing that you go through makes you aware and think about 
				things differently. The process is pretty intense as there is a 
				written exam and a series of presentations and going through the 
				process opens your eyes to things that you take for granted. It 
				is a good confidence booster and encouragement for people to try 
				and achieve more.<br>
				<br>
				For a young person it is a part of one’s development process. As 
				a recipient of the BizPro Award, NTI funds a training course for 
				you and I used it go to the Creative Learning Centre in 
				Singapore, which was a great opportunity as they put you through 
				an extensive leadership course over a week’s time.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tell us something about your educational and professional 
				background?<br>
				</b>After graduating from high school I went to the US for a 
				Bachelor’s degree in accounting and management from the 
				University of South Carolina. On coming back to Oman I joined 
				BankMuscat in September 1999. I started off as a management 
				trainee in the bank and was put on rotation in various 
				departments. After this I was given a choice to join any 
				department and I choose corporate banking. I have enjoyed 
				working at the bank and have worked in different positions. I 
				have a lot of respect and gratitude for my superiors from whom I 
				have learnt so many things. BankMuscat has grown tremendously in 
				these last 12 years and I along with some of my colleagues have 
				grown with the bank. In between, I also went for a few higher 
				education courses which were supported by the bank. I got a 
				Chevening Scholarship and did a Master’s in banking, which 
				helped broaden my knowledge and horizons regarding the banking 
				industry. <br>
				<br>
				At the end of the day one’s career is not just about titles or 
				economic gain but it is also about self satisfaction, if you are 
				happy and feel that you are contributing to your organisation, 
				family and country then you are leading a good career.<br>
				<br>
				<b>There is a lot of stress on building local national talent in 
				Oman. What would your advice be to young Omanis who are 
				embarking on a career?<br>
				</b>My advice to young Omanis is that you should not expect a 
				lot before giving all you can. If you can do your best, think 
				out of the box, be creative and contribute to the organisation 
				that you work for with all your force then rewards and 
				recognition is bound to follow. Most people can do much more 
				than what they think they are capable of. If you can push the 
				envelope then things will look bright automatically for you, but 
				if you sit and wait for things to happen or if you want the 
				company, government or the organisation that you work for to 
				give you everything without reciprocation then you will not be 
				achieving much. First be valuable to the organisation and then 
				value will come to you. Education is very important but it is 
				just a qualification, it only proves your ability to learn, once 
				you are at a work place then you learn everyday and this 
				translates into real experience and value. If you work hard and 
				try to give more than the person next to you, then only will you 
				be appreciated.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Apart from education and intellect, there is a lot of stress 
				on soft skills in today’s management studies. How important is 
				the softer side of business?<br>
				</b>Soft skills are extremely important as working in teams and 
				meeting and interacting with customers, suppliers, superiors, 
				peers and colleagues are part of the job. How you use these 
				networks and people in your day to day work is very important. A 
				lot of people think that your job finishes once you reach home 
				at five, but in my view it continues till your day finishes, 
				because after work you network and socialise and at the end of 
				the day it all counts.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Looking at Oman do you feel that there are a lot of 
				opportunities for youngsters who have the right education and 
				are ready to work hard?<br>
				</b>Sky is the limit in places like the Gulf, as ours are new 
				economies and there are a lot of opportunities. Our 
				infrastructure is new and there is much more to be built by 
				Omanis and the locals. We need expatriates and appreciate the 
				knowledge and skills that they bring to the table as these are 
				not present locally, but it is the nationals and Omanis who will 
				be taking things forward, by leading and building. No city or 
				country was built overnight, it takes hundreds of years, as a 
				country we are relatively a young nation and there are 
				tremendous opportunities for young Omanis as they are the people 
				who will be building our future.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What do you think about the BizPro Awards and in what ways is 
				it beneficial in promoting national talent?</b><br>
				BizPro Awards is a very good initiative and being a part of it I 
				appreciate the efforts that goes into putting up such an 
				initiative. There is a need for more such initiatives; it is 
				also a friendly competition amongst the young and it encourages 
				them to push and do more. It’s a recognition for people, who 
				need to be recognised in different ways. There is probably a 
				need to grow such an initiative by adding different categories, 
				or different things and probably it is time that other 
				organisations started doing something on similar lines. I also 
				feel that BizPro Awards should not be limited just to the 
				private sector but should also include the government and semi 
				government companies. I think some public sector companies like 
				PDO, Oman LNG etc are participating but I am not sure about the 
				participation of the ministry staff which is important. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Push yourself to the limits<br>
				</b><br>
				<img border="0" src="images/education-may-12-3.jpg" width="150" height="225" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="3">Khalid 
				M Al Barwani, Team Leader –General Trading, Corporate Banking, 
				ahlibank and one of the winner of BizPro Awards Young Achiever 
				Award in 2011, speaks to OER.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You were one of the winners in the Young Achievers category 
				at BizPro Awards 2011. What were the factors that helped you win 
				this award?<br>
				</b>It is nothing magical, but the result of hard work, 
				commitment and endeavouring to do my best. Education helps us 
				having a good foundation and academic background sets you off on 
				a sound footing. At the end of the day, you are as good as the 
				work that you put in.<br>
				<br>
				<b>You have done very well at a young age, what would you 
				suggest or advise young Omanis who are looking at embarking on a 
				career? <br>
				</b>It’s more or less the same as I have done in the beginning 
				of my career. Apart from that try and push yourself to the 
				limits and do not be afraid of taking risks. Never stop learning 
				and educating yourself as this is very important.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What do you think about the BizPro Awards and in what ways is 
				it beneficial in promoting national talent?<br>
				</b>Definitely the BizPro Awards is a good programme to promote 
				young Omani talent. NTI should continue and expand BizPro Awards 
				and there should be more such initiatives in Oman. There are a 
				lot of talented Omani youth who should be recognised and 
				highlighted, sometimes by their own organisations but BizPro is 
				one step above and it provides motivation and encouragement for 
				recipients to do more and similarly it encourages other 
				youngsters to strive harder and to get recognised. I used the 
				scholarship given by BizPro to attend an Executive Development 
				Programme in Dubai and it has helped me. The process of 
				selecting the BizPro winners is quite enriching itself as it 
				gives you a chance to challenge yourself, as one competes 
				against many talented people. One is taken through various 
				assessments like a written test where your language and 
				quantitative skills are tested followed by a check of one’s 
				logical reasoning. After this you are put through various 
				scenarios where your leadership skills and ability to work in 
				teams is analysed. Finally, there is an interview and a 
				presentation on a given topic in front of a KPMG panel and based 
				on these tests the winners are chosen.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What do organisations or companies expect from fresh 
				graduates in today’s working environment and how can youngsters 
				equip themselves with the requisite skillsets?<br>
				</b>Organisations expect people to have a lot of soft skills 
				like an ability to work in a team, attitude, willingness to 
				learn and develop. Constant learning is crucial and this can be 
				done in various ways like keeping oneself upto date with your 
				area of expertise and global events and happenings. Part of this 
				is also based on an organisation’s willingness to support its 
				staff by providing them with training and development 
				opportunities, but the willingness and initiative needs to come 
				from the individual.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How important is training for someone to get acquainted with 
				global cross currents and to grow, and are there enough training 
				opportunities in Oman?<br>
				</b>It depends on the industry, in banking there are enough 
				opportunities as the College of Banking and Financial Studies (CBFS) 
				setup a few years ago provides a range of courses and training 
				related to the sector at various levels. CBFS also has tie-ups 
				with external universities and third parties who come in and 
				conduct training. There are a lot of conferences and seminars 
				that happen, but more can be done as there is always room for 
				improvement and programmes like BizPro can help in highlighting 
				such needs and giving it more significance. <br>
				<br>
				<b>In today’s demanding corporate culture how can executives 
				strike a work-life balance?<br>
				</b>Time management is extremely important. At the end of the 
				day we work to live and do not live to work. So striking a 
				balance and getting the right support from one’s family members 
				is important as there are times when you may have to stay back 
				late at work or not get that intended leave. But at the end of 
				the day one needs to devote time and attention to one’s family.&#8194;</td>

				Bukha, Musandam. Muhammed Nafie reports</span></strong><p class="style15" style="text-align: center">

				Musandam, Oman’s strategically important exclave overlooking the 
				Strait of Hormuz, is all set to host a major $600mn oil and gas 
				processing plant with huge potential to spur economic growth in 
				the peninsula. Operated by Oman Oil Company Exploration and 
				Production (OOCEP), the upstream subsidiary of Oman Oil Company, 
				and situated in the Wilayat of Bukha, the Musandam Gas plant (MGP) 
				will be part of a major integrated development project 
				comprising the West Bukha field development, an offshore 
				production pipeline, and crude storage and export facilities.<br>
				<br>
				Expected to start operation in the fourth quarter of 2013, the 
				plant will produce the natural gas to feed Oman’s first 
				gas-based Independent Power Project coming up in Bukha. The 
				plant is also expected to help the Sultanate set up a new oil 
				export terminal on its north coast. The formal construction of 
				the green field plant started recently with a foundation-laying 
				ceremony in Bukha, organised by OOCEP and Hyundai Engineering 
				Company, the prime contractor to build the project. Sayyid 
				Khalifa bin Almurdas bin Ahmed al Busaidi, Governor of Musandam, 
				presided over the ceremony which was attended by Ahmed al 
				Wahaibi, CEO of Oman Oil Company, and Salim al Sibani, CEO of 
				OOCEP, Sang-Rok Sung, Senior Executive Vice-President, Hyundai 
				Engineering Co Ltd and South Korean Ambassador Choe Jong-hyun 
				among other dignitaries.<br>
				<br>
				Says Salim bin Zaher Al Sibani, CEO of OOCEP, “This is a very 
				significant project for Oman and Musandam Governorate. The 
				Musandam Gas Plant is part of a major integrated development 
				comprising the West Bukha field development, offshore production 
				pipeline, crude storage, and export facilities. The gas will be 
				used to feed a future power plant to provide reliable 
				electricity for Musandam. Further, the project will act as a 
				foundation for additional oil and gas developments in the 
				region.”<br>
				<br>
				According to Sang-Rok Sung, senior executive vice-president of 
				Hyundai Engineering Co, “This is an important deal for Hyundai 
				Engineering, as it returns to Musandam province with local 
				supporting services and spreads the reputation of HEC’s oil and 
				gas project in the Sultanate.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Integrated project<br>
				<br>
				</b>The total capacity of the gas plant will be 20,000 barrels 
				of oil per day and 45 million cubic feet of treated gas. This 
				project will also entail construction of 23km of subsea pipeline 
				to bring products from West Bukha field to the plant, storage 
				facilities for oil, a jetty for exporting oil and eventually, 
				another four kilometers of export pipeline for the crude oil.<br>
				The plant will get its feed stock from Bukha and West Bukha oil 
				fields operated by RAK Petroleum. At present, the Sultanate has 
				two offshore fields adjacent to the Musandam peninsula. These 
				fields, Bukha and West Bukha, are operated by RAK petroleum. The 
				Bukha field has been operating since 1994 and West Bukha since 
				2008. The production is currently commingled on the Bukha 
				platform and transported via subsea pipeline to the Khor Khawair 
				Processing Plant in Ras Al Khaimah in the UAE.<br>
				<br>
				Salim also noted the initial production of gas from the plant 
				will be earmarked for power generation and the additional supply 
				will be used for industries. “In the event of gas being 
				available more than Musandam’s requirements, we are 
				interconnecting between the Oman gas grid, the new Musandam grid 
				and the UAE grid via Ras al Khaimah. So there will be a gas 
				interlink between Oman and the UAE via this project.”He also 
				said that the development of blocks 17 and 40, which are part of 
				Musandam governorate, would help in additional supply of natural 
				gas for the processing plant. PetroTel is expected to execute 
				appraisal and exploration activities at block 17 by 2012, <br>
				Salim informed.<br>

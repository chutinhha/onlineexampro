				<b>Tim:</b> Ahmed Al Dheeb, the accusation is, there is no clear vision 
				and the government doesn’t do anything.<b><br>
				Ahmed: </b>Well, I can say that the government has a vision 
				but how clear it is…<br>
				<b><br>
				Tim: </b>It is not clear enough to the lady (points out at 
				Lubna).<br>
				HE Ahmed: If I were to ask the minister of education whether we 
				have a vision, she will say yes we have vision. But if we ask 
				whether this vision satisfies others, then that is another 
				issue.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Tim: </b>It may be there but it’s not being clearly 
				articulated.<br>
				<b>HE Ahmed: </b>Of course, people’s aspirations are more than 
				what we have as of now. Do we need education only education’s 
				sake or for employment? We say we have to educate our people for 
				the future so that they get jobs in Oman. Why should they get 
				jobs only in Oman, they can get jobs outside Oman as well. Every 
				year the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher 
				Education coordinates with the government and the private sector 
				asking about the workforce that is needed, what sort of demand 
				will arise in the next five years so that opportunities can be 
				created for school leavers and graduates.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: </b>Hani Al Zubair, is it a fair accusation that there 
				is no clear vision?<br>
				<b>Hani:</b> I totally agree. I think if the people creating 
				these visions were in the private sector instead of being in the 
				government sector, they probably will be out of their jobs. We 
				have a plan, a vision and there are clear timelines, clear goals 
				that are measurable. Everybody in the company knows where we are 
				going. It has to be clear for everybody to know. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: </b>Do you think government needs more discipline<br>
				<b>Hani:</b> I am not sure whether they need more discipline. I 
				think I have go back to my earlier point, which is dialogue. 
				There may be some great plans somewhere but nobody knows about 
				them. We just know that the government is looking at tourism. Is 
				there a clear line as to where we want to be, how do we want to 
				get there, how do we encourage the private sector because this 
				is what the government says – the private sector has to play its 
				role. We want to play our role but is it crystal clear, where we 
				want to go, so that we actually know how to navigate in order to 
				get there? Before you move on, I just want to make a comment on 
				job creation. A great percentage of expatriates are in very low 
				paid jobs and unfortunately, you cannot find Omanis that are 
				willing to take up those jobs. So there has to be a way for us 
				to limit that expectation of the people and say, look it’s a job 
				and it earns a living and it’s a way of feeding your family.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience: </b>My name is Eihab Al Hajj, I have a private 
				company and in this, 30 per cent of my staff is busy handling 
				the bureaucracy. What kind of message does that send to the 
				investor in the market? That’s an extra burden you have to take 
				on board when you want to set up a business.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Adil:</b> I think employability is an important point, if you look 
				at the gross numbers. We have 40,000-50,000 thousand people 
				coming on to the job market every year. I think there is a 
				consensus that employability is our biggest challenge. We have 
				to recognise that with the 220,000 people in the private sector 
				and the 140,000 in the public sector, the required rate of job 
				creation cannot be sustained with our current way of thinking. 
				We have to look at entrepreneurship as being important and we 
				need to look at how many entrepreneurs we have created in the 
				last 20 years. Fifty years ago, just about everybody was an 
				entrepreneur. The government has to see itself as an enabler of 
				the business environment and do what its customers requires it 
				to do. And this is a two-way street, private businesses have 
				thrived and made money in the last 40 years in this country. 
				They also got to listen and do what the government expects them 
				to do. But the dialogue has to be facilitated and managed. 
				Hussain and I were talking before we came in and we were saying 
				what we need in the government is a department of simplicity and 
				this department has to issue reports, be accountable and 
				transparent. Trust me, the cost of doing business in Oman could 
				drop considerably by just doing that one simple thing.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Hussain:</b> Simplicity and less bureaucracy will automatically lead 
				to many things. And when we come to the point of planning, I 
				think we really plan well. But today’s world doesn’t need 
				complicated planning. Over the years we have been to different 
				countries, we go to Singapore and take really good ideas and 
				say, yes, Oman is small, like Singapore and why can’t we do 
				this? It is very easy. But when we come to the implementation 
				part, and to get the ball rolling it gets difficult. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Dr Salem, Adil Taqi’s point on the department of 
				simplicity. How much more simple can you get?<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> What I wanted to say is that it is very important 
				for people, when they are not happy with what they see from the 
				government, to be able to change through peaceful means. And the 
				government has to react to those demands. Otherwise if we do not 
				allow them to change through peaceful means, they will use other 
				means. But let me ask you one question (pointing to the audience 
				and addressing them). How many of you, this year, voted for Majlis A’Shura? Can you raise your hands… (Very few hands go up 
				among the audience) And you are asking for change. You don’t 
				even practice your basic right to vote. How can you have change. 
				HE Darwish cannot approve the budget before it is discussed and 
				challenged by Majlis A’Shura and these are your elected 
				representatives. You should sit with your elected 
				representatives and place all of your concerns with them because 
				now they have been empowered based on the demands of the people. 
				And you know very well a few ministers who were elected by the 
				people directly were appointed as ministers. They should be 
				accountable for their actions. Do you think it is a free ride? 
				And you have that instrument, that <br>
				institution, use it. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> I would like to take one more vote. How many people didn’t 
				vote because they didn’t think it would make any difference? 
				(Some hands are raised). OK. Quite a few people. Which is a 
				different problem isn’t it?<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> Yes it is<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> If they felt their vote wouldn’t change anything<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> They have to change their paradigm of thinking<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> They don’t believe that it is going to change anything, 
				that it s going to work<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> When people spoke, 15 ministers lost their jobs, 
				what else do you want? (audience claps)<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience:</b> I am Sana Al Balushi, from the ministry of education. 
				Regarding the earlier question of whether the government has the 
				will to change things, I want to say that the government has the 
				will and we have seen that since 1970 the concentration has been 
				on the spread of education. Initially, the focus was on the 
				quantity side, but from 1995, our focus has been on the quality, 
				but it takes time. Besides, there are a lot of reforms underway 
				right now. One of them is the establishment of the National 
				Career Guidance Centre. We are also working on a panel to 
				promote entrepreneurial skills. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Dr Hatem:</b> I know they are doing a very hard in trying to move 
				the process forward improving the quality of education. They are 
				just at the beginning. They have a long way to go. There can 
				never be enough dialogue. We just started this, we need to do 
				more of this. The government is disciplined but they have not 
				been inclusive and the way they were doing things in the past 
				will not be relevant and they have to think about new ways. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience:</b> I am a student at the British School Muscat. And my 
				question is — Has the expatriate community been engaged enough 
				in the long term solution and debate. Especially because they 
				are the key stakeholders and occupy many of the high skilled 
				jobs in Oman?<br>
				HE Ahmed: First of all we would like to thank the expatriate 
				community. They have done a lot for the development of the 
				country. I think yes we do, really the government considers 
				expatriates’ experience in different sectors. We at the ministry 
				of commerce and industry have committees which have expatriates 
				from the private sector as members and we take their advise. We 
				cannot ignore the role they are playing and we cannot replace 
				the whole expatriate community. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> You don’t want to replace a lot of them…<br>
				<b>HE Ahmed: </b>We would like to replace them with Omanis and create 
				jobs. This is the aim and objective of any country in the world, 
				to create jobs for your own citizens. This is not something 
				unique to Oman but a lot of countries around the world do it.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Isn’t there a danger that in the process of Omanisation 
				that the expatriates will feel unwanted and undervalued<br>
				<b>HE Ahmed:</b> I don’t think so. When we started Omanisation, the 
				number of expatriates kept on increasing because of the 
				increasing development programmes. We don’t say that we are 
				going to have 100 per cent Omanis in all sectors. It cannot be 
				and it will not be. Five years ago, we had about 500,000 
				expatriates, now we have close to a million. We don’t think 
				there is a threat of replacing all expatriates. But there is a 
				demand and request from our citizens. And I hope that the 
				government will be able to satisfy the request of its citizens 
				by creating jobs for them. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Adil:</b> I Just want to make a small point about Omanis and 
				expatriates. I think in terms of employment, Omanisation is a 
				percentage of total employment, so in a sense the more 
				expatriates we have, the more jobs we have for Omanis if you 
				look at it another way. But I’ll come to the Omanisation point I 
				made earlier. The SMEs is the one sector that is forgotten. <br>
				<b><br>
				Tim:</b> SMEs?<br>
				<b>Adil:</b> Eihab (from the audience) was talking about bureaucracy 
				and Omanisation as an added cost for a start-up business. But If 
				you are relaxed with them by way of regulation, I think you 
				possibly allow more businesses to set up and therefore more 
				chances for greater number of businesses in the future that then 
				will take a larger number of Omanis. But if you increase the 
				cost of doing business right from the word go, chances are that 
				a lot of money that would have gone to setting up businesses 
				would sit in banks. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience:</b> As a small part of the private sector, I think that 
				the point of dialogue with the youth is very important. But the 
				dialogue has to be two-way. Yes we have to listen to their 
				aspirations but we have to make sure that the aspirations are 
				realistic. My customers demand of me professional competence and 
				experience. Experience does not come with a piece of paper. 
				Experience comes with starting at the bottom and working your 
				way up through the system. The young Omanis I interview on a 
				regular basis do not want to start at the bottom. <br>
				<b><br>
				Tim:</b> Ahmed Al Dheeb, what would you say to that?<br>
				<b>HE Ahmed:</b> Omanis don’t want to start at the bottom and this was 
				true maybe 5, 7 or 10 years ago. But now you will find Omanis in 
				all the sectors and at all levels. You will now find a demand 
				for all kinds of the jobs. But there are some complaints about 
				the way they are treated and the salary levels they are getting 
				from the private sector. I have seen an old lady working in the 
				private sector for 25 years and she has been getting only RO250. 
				This is not fair and people would not be willing to do this kind 
				of a job. And that is why we saw people from the private sector 
				getting onto the streets. <br>
				<br>
				On the other hand we have companies who have achieved 70-80 per 
				cent Omanisation and the workers are very happy with those 
				companies, because they are treated well, there are growth 
				plans, and training opportunities. So we have companies who 
				complain about Omanisation, and we have companies who say 
				Omanisation is good and Omanis are hardworking. So there are 
				sides, everyone is not excellent nor is everyone bad. Just to 
				talk about bureaucracy, this issue has cropped up many times 
				here in this debate. Things have changed in the last three to 
				four years ago. For example, at the Ministry of Commerce and 
				Industry’s one stop shop, 85 per cent of applications received 
				are processed on the same day. And these numbers are documented 
				with us. There are some things which have a long process but as 
				I said we are improving. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Hani:</b> I want to go back to the lady who is working for RO250 for 
				such a long time. I think there has been failure on two parts 
				for that lady. The organisation, not helping her to develop; and 
				the woman not developing herself. We have had similar issues 
				within our organisation. If we have drivers, I can’t potentially 
				see that I am ever going to pay a driver RO1,000 or RO2,000, no 
				matter how long he works for me. But what I would like to 
				actually do is to develop the person to be able to take the next 
				tier job, so that he can move into a different bracket. And I 
				agree that the private sector doesn’t play its role in 
				developing its own internal people as much as possible but also 
				I think there is also a lot of resistance, with some people who 
				just want to do the same job. They are comfortable and they are 
				happy where they are. I don’t think salary is a factor of how 
				long you have been with a company, but it should be productivity 
				and quality and the level of job being actually done by the 
				person.<br>
				Hussain: Well, I want to comment on the question that the Omanis 
				don’t want to start from the bottom. Culturally, our forefathers 
				worked outside Oman in the neighbouring countries in all kinds 
				of jobs. Of course, in this new generation, we have a generation 
				gap. The generation that came out after the 1970s, opened their 
				eyes to the modern things and there is a cultural problem. 
				Omanis are reluctant to work in the construction sector or in 
				other sectors that require working in harsh conditions and this 
				will take time to change. I think the private sector needs to 
				bear a responsibility to train such youngsters, even at a cost.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Is it also the case in the society that the expectations 
				from young people are too high, professor Shanfari?<br>
				<b>Dr Hatem:</b> It is understood that the expectations will always be 
				high from the young ones. The people are always aspiring to a 
				better position, to a better life, and if they are not able to 
				get what they wanted, they get very disappointed and express 
				their disappointment in many ways, sometimes in unpleasant ways. 
				But I think the young Omanis and the community in general is 
				very reasonable and the events that have taken place in February 
				and March despite its negative aspects showed that there is a 
				lot of maturity and understanding. People are not insane in 
				their expectations, people are aspiring for a better future; the 
				fact is that they have been excluded from the benefit of the 
				wealth that has been created and the economic growth plus the 
				jobs that have been created in the past. Even though it has been 
				growing at a very fast rate, it was not the right types of jobs 
				that Omanis are aspiring for. It’s the not the jobs that can 
				create sustainability. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Dr Salem, you wanted to add something. There is also the 
				point that people are not taking responsibility for themselves 
				which is Hani’s point.<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> Indeed and this is not an attack or an accusation 
				that Omanis do not want to take jobs at the bottom but what I 
				want to say to the Omanis is that they have to start from the 
				bottom. I started with the British Bank of the Middle East with 
				the salary of RO25, and then I moved to Cable and Wireless, 
				laying cables in the ground and believe me the terrain over here 
				is not that easy to dig channels and lay the cable; then I got 
				an increase of RO25 so I got RO50 . I have done other jobs like 
				a table waiter for Mc Donalds, then a truck driver etc. I wish I 
				had started as a minister, but my overnight success to become a 
				minister took me 28 years. . (audience claps).<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience:</b> My name is Nutayla Al Kindy. If we go to the 
				government sector, and you go into their offices, the mood is 
				completely different from a private company. People are very 
				lazy, laid back and nobody is willing to work. On the contrary 
				if you go to the private sector you see people working long 
				hours, they are probably paid better but at the end of the day 
				they are efficient. If we want our children to understand that 
				they have to start small and then grow, then we need to train 
				them. We have a large expatriate community, because they are 
				willing to work harder. So, how are you going to tackle this 
				element?<br>
				<b>Adil:</b> I just want to pick up on the topic, Omanis don’t want to 
				start at the lowest level. I think, as a desire, that is not a 
				crime. We all want a little better. It’s how that expectation is 
				managed and addressed through the education system. I think 
				attitude is the big part of the education system that has often 
				been overlooked. I just want to pick up on the Omanis in the 
				construction industry. We have three fantastic sites where we’ve 
				got 550 Omanis based on site. And they do work up to 12 hours a 
				day. They have dug our marinas, they have moved the earth, 
				constructed villas and done a lot of other things. So I think 
				there are two sides, there is awareness and there is a need to 
				engage people to shoulder the challenge. And I think people will 
				respond, people do respond.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Let me go back to the questioner here. You raised a lot of 
				questions. How would you answer some of them?<br>
				<b>Nutayla:</b> How would I answer? I have to become a minister first. 
				It goes back to the education. I don’t think that education 
				system is up to par. We only have about four really good schools 
				and if you can’t afford to put your children there, then they 
				don’t have a good base. So it has to start there. That’s one. 
				Secondly, why can’t the public sector start establishing 
				training institutes? <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Ahmed Al Dheeb. Why can’t the public sector do them? <br>
				<b>HE Ahmed:</b> We are organising trainings. At the same time, we have 
				over 50 private training centres providing courses and the 
				government subsidises the training of Omanis. These private 
				training centres are supposed to have good quality trainers so 
				that they can create qualified Omanis. Well I would agree that 
				we have to put a lot of money and quality human resources and 
				trainers for training. One of the reasons why we have 90 per 
				cent Omanisation in the banks is because we have very high 
				quality financial colleges with the graduates that can go to the 
				banks and do the jobs. I do agree totally that in our industrial 
				estates we should have very good training institutes that can 
				train Omanis who can be absorbed into industries. But this is 
				not only the government’s job, it is also the job of the private 
				sector.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The government is spending millions of rials on
				the initiative. </b><br>
				<br>
				<b>Hani:</b> May I just add that the comments I think are absolutely 
				spot on. The private sector also needs to play its role in this 
				area. The biggest worry that I have in Oman is that every 
				company fears that it is competing with everyone else and nobody 
				wants to help anyone else out. Finally after many years of 
				arguing, fighting and deliberations, I think the automotive 
				sector has finally managed through the efforts of a single 
				person to sit down together and agree that we all pool our 
				resources together and create a big institution that we can 
				actually deliver the kind of people that we need for our organisations. I think that if the other sectors can do a 
				similar kind of thing that’s the best way to really start up the 
				SMEs. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim: </b>Dr Salem, you want to throw a pebble into these comforting 
				waters, certainly don’t you?<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem: </b>I think if the government were to give subsidies to 
				these institutes for training, you will get institutes but you 
				won’t get training because people will always go after the 
				subsidies. I think what’s important is to have a healthy 
				competition, when you have healthy competition, you will have 
				innovation and creativity. If the government were to provide 
				subsidies they should give them to the people and allow the 
				people the freedom to choose which training institute they want 
				to go to and allow the market to decide in terms of which one 
				would meet their requirement. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> We have one question from Twitter. What is being done to 
				bridge the gap between education and employment in terms of 
				skills beyond the seminars? <br>
				<b>Dr Hatem:</b> I believe in education for the sake of education to 
				start with. In countries where the education programme is good 
				like UK for example, a graduate in history is able to take a 
				very challenging job in the banking industry or investment 
				banking. So it’s not the issue of education. Do you have the 
				right education and if you have the right education, the right 
				attitude? These skills can be transferable and through on job 
				training you can change through the challenges that are ahead of 
				you. So I say that still the quality of education is a real 
				issue. Without having the right skills it is very difficult to 
				progress and very difficult to have the employability as others 
				who have a
				good education.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience:</b> I am Saad Al Jenaibi. What happened back in February 
				was something that I would call a wake-up call. A wake-up call 
				for both the private and the public sectors. Because both of us 
				are losers if we don’t work together. I think the government has 
				done enough, but the private sector has to do a lot more and 
				they have to work together. I also think we need to scrap our 
				vision of 2020 and go to 2040, realising that the past education 
				system was not up to the standards that everybody expects. <br>
				<b>Audience:</b> (Dr Amer Rawas, CEO, Omantel). I would like to build 
				on Dr Hatem’s latest comment on education that a graduate in 
				history in UK will find a good job in a bank. I think for us to 
				achieve that we need a paradigm shift in the way we deliver 
				education. Right now our education is predominantly a teaching 
				paradigm. I think we need to move to a learning paradigm. We 
				should equip our students with the capacity to learn 
				independently. I think this is a role that can only be driven by 
				the government and the government should lead this paradigm 
				shift. But once these graduates move onto a job, then the 
				private sector has a greater role to play by accommodating these 
				graduates, not expecting them to deliver on the same day; but do 
				some on the job training and equip them with specific skills 
				required for the specific function for them to deliver the 
				expected results. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience:</b> My name is Mohammed Al Kharusi. I am from the MB Group 
				of Companies. What we need is a radical rethink in terms of the 
				vision, strategy, training and what Oman wants to have in terms 
				of employment. The sort of industries we are creating are 
				probably capital intensive needing very high level of skills 
				which takes a long time to actually develop. What we need are 
				industries or individuals who can be trained very quickly say 
				within three or four weeks and they can be up and running. 
				Industries which can take Omani products and add value to them, 
				so that we can employ the 50, the 60 or the 70 thousand people 
				who will be coming out in the next five years. I would suggest 
				some sort of a think tank consisting of technocrats, government 
				and investment authorities and entrepreneurs to look at all the 
				issues that are hindering us from moving forward. <br>
				<b>Tim:</b> OK. Thank you very much. There is one more question.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audience:</b> My name is Mohammed Al Harthy. I am the CEO of OPAL. 
				There are two comments which I want to make. One is about 
				expatriates versus Omanis. Expatriates needs to be respected and 
				they are respected. With respect to salary differences, let’s 
				not only talk about low level salaries, but as a CEO, I would 
				love to have an expatriate salary as well. Second is about 
				education. Education is important and a paradigm shift is 
				needed, however I think, we need to start from the basics – we 
				need to study the supply and demand properly to understand what 
				needed and then gear our education system to provide those 
				needs. <br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Thank you. We are running out of time. I would like to take 
				one more vote from you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Question:</b> Do you fear a repeat of the 
				protests that took place in February? Here we are. 71 per cent 
				fear a repeat of the protests, 29 per cent do not. Dr Salem, 
				before you go back to some of the other questions, your reaction 
				to this vote. This is quite alarming, isn’t it?<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> But its natural.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Why?<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> Because we have to work on improving, we cannot 
				stop… <br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Under the threat of continuing protests?<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> Indeed, we have to be very much proactive. We have 
				to…<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Is that going to bring out the best in you?<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> I hope it will.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tim:</b> Ahmed Al Dheeb. Are you alarmed by that?<br>
				<b>HE Ahmed:</b> Well if we didn’t improve our services and we don’t 
				create jobs for Omanis yes will find that. I think from most of 
				the questions that we heard today we can make out that most 
				people are not satisfied about the bureaucracy, the government’s 
				speed of decision making. But what I can say is that the 
				government is working, we will have to increase our speed, I 
				think. Some decisions have to be made faster. A lot of people 
				have been talking about the vision and the right vision. A 
				vision is usually an indicator, a guideline for the government. 
				We have had a vision from 1995, which is the Vision 2020. It has 
				targets and numbers and tools to those goals. In fact in certain 
				sectors, we are already way ahead of what is enumerated in 
				Vision 2020 document.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Hani:</b> I think this is scary. If we have a room full of business 
				leaders, government officials, people who have more capability 
				to change policies and discussion topics in the country, if they 
				feel that anything that they do is not going to have the right 
				result or in a quick time as possible, that this is going to 
				happen, I think it is worrying.<br>
				Hussain: I voted for no because as the road is going on, I feel 
				we have learned the lessons and we are all going to change. If 
				we are not going to change, of course, then the 70 per cent are 
				right.<br>
				<b>Dr Hatem:</b> If you were to ask the same question to the young 
				people in Oman, the percentage would be very high, close to 100 
				per cent. And I am more happy to see this because this is 
				reflective of the people’s feelings. It’s not scary, because 
				it’s the reality that we have to face. If we were going to be 
				reactive, it is going to cause more problems. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Adil:</b> I think the statistics are useful and healthy. One, it is 
				reflective of how people feel and also it is going to keep 
				complacency at bay. I think it is going to keep us focused and 
				raise the level of urgency. But I think what this highlights is 
				that we believe and know that the issues are never going to go 
				away fully. People evolve, their aspirations evolve and grow, 
				and they will always have issues and this goes back to the point 
				made earlier by Hani about the dialogue. We need to find ways to 
				engage the street in the policy making. And then only will it be 
				a much better place.<br>
				<b>HE Dr Salem:</b> We started with education and we ended up with 
				education and in the middle job creation. I hope we don’t 
				confuse between job creation and job substitution because Omanisation at the end of the day is nothing but job 
				substitution. We don’t create anything by replacing one person 
				with another person. Again, we have to change the basic meaning 
				of education. It should not be teaching students of what to 
				believe but it should be teaching students how to think. When 
				they are creative then other things will follow. <br>
				Tim: Thanks to panelists and the audience.

				<br>
				What Smart, elegant looking offices have become part of our 
				corporate culture. A swanky office impresses everyone. Two 
				decades ago, technology at its best meant a fax machine and an 
				electronic typewriter; today it’s an iPad connected to your 
				enterprise cloud solution. The modern office is a smart office 
				which makes use of things designed and made in such a way that 
				these are practical and aesthetically appealing. Smart 
				technology at the office place is revolutionising the way 
				people, process and technology integrate. Conference calling, 
				web conferencing, unified messaging, voice mail, replay line, 
				fax-on-demand, virtual office, software solutions are some areas 
				where cutting-edge technology is required to make an office look 
				smart.<br>
				<br>
				Today, research on smart environments represents some of the 
				most innovative work being done in computer science, electrical 
				engineering, and information systems. The interdisciplinary 
				scope of the field integrates aspects of machine learning, 
				human-machine interfacing, wireless networking, mobile 
				communications, sensor networks, and pervasive computing. As 
				research efforts devise intelligent environments for use in 
				homes, offices, classrooms, hospitals, and automobiles, 
				far-reaching applications – from design and architecture to 
				health care issues and software engineering–become increasingly 
				evident.<br>
				Electronic systems used in an office environment are comprised 
				of hardware and software components. When used together, these 
				components are capable of storing, retrieving, manipulating, 
				transferring, computing, and printing information. Hardware 
				components include, but are not limited to, electronic 
				typewriters, word processors, personal computers, work stations 
				(keyboards and visual displays) linked to a computer, and 
				associated equipment such as printers, optical scanners, and 
				modems. Typical types of software used in office automation work 
				include word processing, electronic mail, calendar, project 
				management, database management, desk-top publishing, graphics 
				and spreadsheet.<br>
				<br>
				Nowadays, office interiors are being renovated to accommodate 
				the demands of such communication, keeping aesthetics and space 
				management as top priority. Overhead projectors, plasma screens, 
				surround sound systems, sleek microphones, video cameras and 
				other gizmos find discreet space.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Modern Office Automation</b><br>
				Office automation refers to the varied computer machinery and 
				software used to digitally create, collect, store, manipulate 
				and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic 
				tasks and goals. The history of modern office automation began 
				with the typewriter and the copy machine, which mechanised 
				previously manual tasks. Today, however, office automation is 
				increasingly understood as a term that refers not just to the 
				mechanisation of tasks but to the conversion of information to 
				electronic form as well. The advent of the personal computer 
				revolutionised office automation, and today, popular operating 
				systems and user interfaces dominate office computer systems. 
				This revolution has been so complete, and has infiltrated so 
				many areas of business, that almost all businesses use at least 
				one commercial computer business application in the course of 
				daily activity. Even the smallest companies commonly utilise 
				computer technology to maintain financial records, inventory 
				information, payroll records, and other pertinent business 
				information. <br>
				<br>
				Office automation helps in optimising or automating existing 
				office procedures. The backbone of office automation is a Local 
				Area Network (LAN), which allows users to transmit data, mail 
				and even voice across the network. All office functions, 
				including dictation, typing, filing, copying, fax, telex, 
				microfilm and records management, telephone and telephone 
				switchboard operations, fall into this category. Office 
				automation was a popular term in the 1970s and 1980s as the 
				desktop computer exploded onto the scene. A universal truth is 
				dawning on the multinational brand names the world over that 
				brands are incidental and the solution is the driver.<br>
				<br>
				Decision makers today treat information technology (IT) as their 
				basic need for any business. Recovery cost depends on the 
				customer. The earlier the customer decides to put implement IT 
				solutions, the faster the returns. Spiralling costs can be 
				handled in many ways. And one of them is to optimise on the 
				functions of the gadgets like printers, fax machines, printers, 
				notebooks and laptops, scanners etc.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Effective communication</b><br>
				It has been found that when employers give employees an 
				environment they feel comfortable and good in, they become more 
				productive and satisfied in the workplace. Staying connected is 
				also critical in a company’s ability to respond to a customer’s 
				changing needs, with the latest technology to work around. The 
				Smart Office equipments now come in portable sizes too, so that 
				the user may even cart it along to another part of the continent 
				– and never have to miss out on an important meeting.<br>
				<br>
				Researchers who studied teams of software programmers working on 
				a project and huddled in one room for four months revealed that 
				they (software developers) spent less than half their time at 
				tasks like programming and coding; the remainder of their day 
				was spent on meetings, problem resolution with team members or 
				clients, product testing, etc.<br>
				<br>
				Isolated in cubicles, communication between programmers was 
				impaired; researchers found that the further apart team members 
				were, the less they talked to each other. The net effect of 
				ineffective communication was that projects habitually came in 
				overtime and exceeded their budgets. This research confirmed the 
				positive effect of locating employees in a more flexible, open 
				space. Time-to-market, or cycle time for the software programmes 
				developed by the teams dropped by one-third as compared to a 
				company baseline. Communication and problem resolution were 
				enhanced by close proximity to others on the team. Once upon a 
				time, every employee was housed in a cubicle or individual 
				office. These days, there are fewer permanent addresses; not 
				every employee needs a personal work station in a digital 
				workplace.<br>
				<br>
				The average office space used to be 70 per cent cubicles and 30 
				per cent collaborative or shared space. Today, that equation is 
				55 per cent cubicles and 45 per cent shared space. In the agile 
				office, a hybrid solution often works best: small private rooms 
				for concentrated work, personal work stations in open office 
				settings for team work, and a variety of formal and informal 
				meeting spaces. Work spaces are simultaneously shrinking: from a 
				standard unit of 8 by 10 feet to one as small as 6 by 6 feet in 
				an open office plan. Work station walls are coming down, to open 
				up views and allow occupants to enjoy natural light.<br>
				<br>
				<b>A friendly ambience<br>
				</b>Further, as health and safety of employees becomes paramount 
				for companies, most corporate offices are switching to ergonomic 
				and functional furniture. These areas are designed to break the 
				monotony of workplaces and create a healthy working atmosphere 
				where employees feel relaxed. The trend is to create a friendly 
				ambience for both management and employees like a community, 
				where everyone is familiar with another, a place where all needs 
				are met, physical as well as psychological. Therefore a smart 
				office will strive to create an environment that has a smart, 
				attractive, friendly design and can form an office ambience 
				which is flexible, effective and welcoming for employees, which 
				makes them feel like coming to work, and motivates them to 
				increase productivity. Creating a non- or low-toxic workplace 
				would be a plus point for a smart office. For example: Use 
				low-VOC paints along with 100 per cent virgin wool carpets made 
				without chemicals or dyes (wool carpet lasts much longer than 
				does synthetic carpet, so the carpeting will not need to be 
				replaced as quickly).<br>
				<br>
				Natural carpet padding (made of jute fibres encased in recycled 
				paper) when tacked to the floor help avoid the chemical 
				offgassing that would have occurred had they been glued. Several 
				practical steps can help you to create a healthier workplace. 
				The key to a healthier office is prevention – in other words, 
				use healthy and efficient building, lighting, and HVAC design, 
				and use nontoxic building materials, furnishings, and office 
				supplies. The best way to create a green and healthy environment 
				is to begin by carrying out an environmental audit to study the 
				duct system, building and lighting design, and office 
				furnishings and to survey employees. The company can create 
				corporate policies that encourage healthier purchasing decisions 
				and production methods and support employee health.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Investing in design<br>
				</b>Utilities such as mobile phones, computers or laptops, 
				telephone network, printers, scanners, fax machines and 
				photocopiers use or share computer based data and software 
				applications for higher productivity, saving on time. Creative 
				and insightful planning and refurnishing of work environments 
				are essential to remaining in the race. Design is no longer an 
				expense; it is an investment. This means investing heavily at 
				the front end to ensure productivity and higher staff retention. 
				Innovative design trends are becoming prevalent and attention is 
				being paid to creative and strategic thinking and interactive 
				idea exchanges.<br>
				<br>
				Some of the facets of new work environments include: attractive 
				and inviting private and group work spaces; tree-lined interiors 
				and an emphasis on views; creative thinking areas with drawable 
				walls and surfaces; and even whimsical props such as stuffed 
				animals for inspiration. Traditionally conservative firms are 
				moving away from the old-fashioned look and designing in terms 
				of flexibility, technology and service to create smart office 
				environments for their employees. Cardinal zones in different 
				colours, diffuse, luminous lighting, and an atmosphere that 
				feels more like home as well as systems that include retractable 
				drawable surfaces, spatial dividers of wire mesh, luminescent 
				plastic panels for privacy, and trees.<br>

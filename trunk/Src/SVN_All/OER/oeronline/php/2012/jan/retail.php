				<b>What 
				is the idea behind the acquisition of Al Ahlia’s factory in 
				Sohar?<br>
				</b>This is something that we had been looking around for and we 
				had our own plans for expanding our capacity. For the last few 
				years we were constantly growing and we were in need of 
				additional capacity. We have been allocated a fairly large tract 
				of land in Sohar Industrial Estate and have plans to shift part 
				of our machinery there over a period of time. When Al Ahlia 
				closed down four years ago we were seriously looking at buying 
				the company in a running situation, but we were not able to 
				determine the financial liability of the company to any great 
				accuracy, so the shareholders decided not to venture into it.<br>
				<br>
				Nevertheless, we made an offer to buy their machinery and they 
				were prepared for it, but we could not arrive at a feasible 
				value. As the company went into liquidation and things were put 
				up for sale, we took the necessary legal clearances and made a 
				bid for the company. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry found 
				our bid of RO2.55mn to be the highest and we got an approval to 
				acquire the plant and machinery. We got physical possession in 
				September 2011.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How much work has taken place on the plant since September to 
				get it up and running?</b><br>
				We have planned to do it in two phases – in the first phase we 
				plan to do some ground work and start commercial production from 
				January 2012. The next phase which will take another six months 
				to one year, we will revamp the entire plant and machinery, 
				increase capacity, correct the process flow. Hopefully by the 
				next year we should have the full plant ready. We will invest 
				around RO1mn over these two phases.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How much will the plant add to your capacity?</b><br>
				The acquisition will double our capacity from 30,000 tonnes per 
				annum to 60,000 tonnes per annum, but we may take a decision to 
				increase our capacity there and reduce our capacity in our 
				existing plant in Ghubra, over a period of time. Eventually we 
				would like to have all our production in one place as that would 
				give us an advantage, but that will take two to three years.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How will the acquisition benefit The National Detergent 
				Company?</b><br>
				We already had a plan to shift our base to a bigger capacity 
				plant and the Al Ahlia factory fits into that. Secondly, being 
				in Sohar there should be certain export advantages in terms of 
				freight and the development of the Sohar Port. Our overseas 
				market accounts for 75 per cent of our sales and being in Sohar 
				should benefit us in exports. Though the freight scenario has 
				changed recently due to the rule of using only vehicles 
				registered in Oman, earlier shipping out goods from Sohar used 
				to give us a saving of 8-10 per cent on freight costs compared 
				to Muscat.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How has the company fared in 2011?</b><br>
				The GCC markets and the Middle East accounts for a bulk of our 
				exports and despite the unrest in the region, these countries 
				have shown good growth helping our sales. NDC’s export volumes 
				grew by 12-15 per cent in 2011. <br>

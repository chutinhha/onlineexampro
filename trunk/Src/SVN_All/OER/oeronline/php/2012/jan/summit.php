				<strong><span class="style14">The 3rd Muscat Youth Summit 
				showcased Oman’s stance on youth entrepreneurship, urban 
				development innovation and creativity. Mayank Singh reports</span></strong><p class="style15">
				The third Muscat Youth Summit (MYS) was held at the Millennium 
				Resort in Al Musannah from December 4 to 7, 2011. Over 200 young 
				people aged 15 – 24 drawn from 21 countries participated in this 
				international residential programme organised by the Brand Oman 
				Management Unit (BOMU). Over the course of the four days, 36 
				presenters delivered 18 workshops on topics that included social 
				entrepreneurship, hybrid cities, urban sustainability, street 
				photography, DIY publishing, graffiti art and social media. 
				Besides Oman, the summit’s participants came from countries such 
				as Belarus, Turkey, Australia, Sweden, Germany, France, the 
				United States, Great Britain, Tunisia, Singapore, Yemen, Iraq, 
				Lebanon, Syria, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, Malaysia, 
				and Brazil. <br>

				“MYS intends to help young people find new opportunities in life 
				with a particular emphasis on entrepreneurship, innovation, 
				creativity and urban development. It’s been designed to 
				strengthen youth-related policies, help government organisations 
				and the private sector address youth concerns and support new 
				information and learning channels for young people. Moreover, 
				MYS blends social interaction with cultural, economic and 
				entrepreneurial components to create an experience that promotes 
				cross-cultural youth dialogue and socially responsible 
				leadership. It’s an outstanding and rewarding four days for 
				everyone involved,” remarked HH Sayyid Faisal Al Said, COO, BOMU. 
				As a nation, Oman actively encourages and welcomes innovators, 
				talent and ideas that add value to the country and increases its 
				national competitiveness and it’s this philosophy that’s at the 
				heart of MYS. The endeavours of the Sultanates youth in 
				enterprise, their energy, enthusiasm and success presents a 
				wonderful image of Oman to the world and is a key part of BOMU 
				branding efforts.<br>
				<br>
				“We’re very excited about this year’s Summit as we’ve attracted 
				some really outstanding international and domestic workshop 
				presenters. And through the 18 workshops we’re looking to 
				promote citizenship and community participation; develop skills, 
				aspirations and talents in order to increase employability; 
				nurture young leaders and provide them with opportunities to 
				develop entrepreneurial and creative skills; and of course 
				increase cultural awareness, diversity and understanding. On 
				reflection, I don’t think there’s an event quite like MYS 
				anywhere in the Gulf. It’s an outstanding advertisement for 
				Oman,” HH Sayyid Faisal added. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Engaging young minds<br>
				</b><br>
				Floor Lieshout, director, Youth for Road Safety (YOURs) and a 
				presenter says, “Our aim is to give young people an 
				understanding of the risk and the importance of road safety. 
				Every year 400,000 young people under the age of 25 years die in 
				road accidents and the youth needs to be a part of the solution. 
				Research shows that young people retain only 10 per cent of what 
				they read about such issues after two weeks, so we take a more 
				interactive approach giving them an overview of issues like the 
				importance of wearing seat belts, avoiding over speeding and 
				distracted driving.”<br>
				<br>
				Speaking about his presentation on Sustainable Cities, Peter 
				Oborn, deputy chairman, Aedas Architects, says “Our presentation 
				to the students focuses on the importance of creating 
				sustainable cities. These are cities which are in harmony with 
				itself and where one can live, work, play and prosper. In 
				addition one can look after the needs of the future generation. 
				The challenge for cities world over is to moderate themselves. 
				As young people are the decision makers of tomorrow, it is 
				important that they are aware of this important issue.”<br>
				In the same vein Maryam Hamad al-Sharji, architect, head of 
				design, Ministry of Housing, Oman says, “We are trying to 
				acquaint youngsters with the concept of hybrid cities involving 
				its various components. Though this is an abstract concept, we 
				were impressed by how students were able to understand the 
				various nuances of the concept in a short time.” <br>
				<br>
				<b>A wide canvas<br>
				</b>&nbsp;<br>
				Says Sarah White, arts advisor and general manager, Bait Al 
				Zubair Foundation, “My presentation is titled – ‘Art and the 
				artists response to the environment’. I am analysing my own 
				works, especially those from my school days, so that I can show 
				the students how the environment has affected my work and the 
				feelings that I want to project in my work. The idea is to get 
				them to start thinking about different types of environments 
				like architectural, global, landscape based or personal 
				environments, and the message that they want to project through 
				their art work.”<br>
				<br>
				Radhika A Hamlai, an artist says, “This is the first time that I 
				am here and it is very interesting. I was very impressed by the 
				way the MYS blends in different cultures and gives students a 
				chance to do something that they have not done before.” <br>
				<br>
				Carlos Chirinos from SOAS Radio says, “Our workshop aims to 
				produce short radio programmes addressing the UN’s Millennium 
				Development Goals like eradication of hunger and poverty, gender 
				equality, maternal health, combating malaria and so on. Today 
				the 18-24 year generation is the same world over because of 
				global connectivity and our effort is to make them think about 
				what will be beneficial to them and the developing world.” <br>

				<br>
				While pointing out that MYS receives high-level local and global 
				support, HH Sayyid Faisal thanked the Sultanate’s Ministry of 
				Education, Oman National Commission for Education, Culture and 
				Science, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNPA and UNESCO. “Not only 
				for their important support of MYS, but also for the shining 
				example these organisations continue to set to the wider 
				community, through their practical and positive commitment to 
				the wellbeing of Oman’s youth,” he said. <br>
				<br>
				Ali Kamal Khadra a grade 11 student participating in the MYS 
				says, “The MYS is a great experience for all of us. It is very 
				well organised. The atmosphere is really nice and one gets to 
				meet students from different countries. Every day we work on a 
				different topic and it is all about team work. We have learnt a 
				lot here.”<br>

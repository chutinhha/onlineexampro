				<br>
				</b>Ajay Ganti, CEO, SARCO has a problem on his hands. 
				Surprisingly, while he is working overtime to resolve the issue 
				he also seems to be quite pleased with the situation. As we 
				settle down for the interview, Ganti shares his predicament – 
				the response to the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S III 
				mobile phone has been so overwhelming that the distributor is 
				running out of stocks to satisfy the market’s insatiable demand. 
				So while he requests Samsung to ship additional supplies, he is 
				rationing the available stocks amongst retailers and corporate 
				clients. <br>
				<br>
				This is not the first time that SARCO, the official distributor 
				of Samsung audio visual, mobile phones and home appliance 
				products in the Sultanate has stuck with a problem of plenty. 
				The company has been on a roll for the last four-five years and 
				the numbers speak for themselves. Samsung is arguably the market 
				leader in televisions, home appliances and mobile phones. It 
				enjoys 38 per cent marketshare in televisions, 40 per cent in 
				smart phones, 30 per cent in mobile phones market and above 40 
				per cent share in certain home appliance categories. SARCO is 
				also a franchisee of other leading brands like Citizen, Casio, 
				American Breeze, Q&amp;Q and Severin. <br>
				<br>
				The company’s success has not gone unnoticed. Microsoft 
				announced a distribution pact covering its Original Equipment 
				Manufacturer (OEM) and commercial business for Oman with SARCO 
				in May 2012. Under the terms of this partnership, SARCO will be 
				responsible for steering the reseller business, increasing 
				Microsoft OEM product revenue and supporting the development of 
				the local channel. <br>
				<br>
				<b>The turnaround <br>
				</b>SARCO’s success though has not been achieved by sudden 
				flight. When Ganti joined the company in 2006, Samsung was not 
				even amongst the top five brands in either the audio visual (AV) 
				or home appliances (HA) categories. The brief given to him was 
				simple – reinvigorate the company. Amongst the first decisions 
				that Ganti took was to get out of the furniture business, as he 
				did not see it synergise with AV and HA business. Says Ganti, 
				“Office furniture used to share showroom space with AV and HA 
				products. We had good products and LCDs were catching up and as 
				Samsung was the world leader in LCDs we could see the potential 
				in the market.” <br>
				<br>
				Then SARCO used to grow at a leisurely rate of 5-10 per cent per 
				annum; but in an effort to scale up the business, Ganti set a 50 
				per cent growth target in the very first year. While this came 
				as a shock to most of his colleagues, they gradually started to 
				believ in his vision. “It was important to scale up the topline, 
				as one can always manage the bottomline with better 
				efficiencies.” To back this vision and to increase visibility 
				SARCO allocated an aggressive advertising budget in 2007. The 
				company took up an annual advertising contract with leading 
				publications like Oman Economic Review, Times of Oman and 
				Thursday magazines for the whole year.<br>
				<br>
				The other priority was to strengthen its distribution channels. 
				Though Samsung was retailing at stores like LuLu, Carrefour and 
				other outlets, there was a feeling that big format retailers 
				were doing Samsung a favour by displaying its wares. “We 
				convinced our retailers that we will add value and increase the 
				overall size of the market,” says Ganti. The company did a 
				market mapping to figure out prime and peripheral areas, its 
				strengths and the scope of growth. “It was all about getting the 
				four P’s -- price, product, promotion, and place right.” <br>
				<br>
				<b>Bulls eye<br>
				</b>The 32 inch LCD TV was identified as a flagship product and 
				the company worked on a calibrated strategy to increase its 
				visibility and presence. In LuLu, SARCO identified unused areas 
				like aisles and convinced the retailer to lease them out to it 
				for product display. “The aisles were active areas and when 
				people walked through them they noticed our products, and these 
				unused areas in turn became a source of rent for LuLu.” The 
				company also used the Samsung branding on the stairs between the 
				two escalators connecting the ground and first floors at LuLu.
				<br>
				<br>
				In another significant move, it started using a cluster display 
				for Samsung products as it helped customers to make an informed 
				choice. In addition the company wanted its products to be 
				displayed at the eye level. This was a mould breaker as TVs used 
				to be sold stacked on shelves from the ground to the ceiling. 
				Says Ganti, “As most people use their TVs at the eye level, it 
				helps customers to get a more realistic feel about how the 
				product would look at home.” SARCO employed dedicated sales 
				staff on the shop floor who gave an informed demonstration of 
				the product. The stress was on highlighting the strengths of 
				Samsung products while not de-selling other brands. <br>
				<br>
				In 2006, AV products in Oman were priced at around 10 per cent 
				higher than the regional market (to compensate for lower 
				volumes). SARCO did away with this disparity by pricing its 
				products at the same level as the other markets. Thus customers 
				got to buy products at never before prices. The efforts paid off 
				in a big way. “From 2008 onwards we became the No 1 in the LCD 
				market and our share has never dropped below 50 per cent. Though 
				our competitors have become aggressive in the last two years, 
				our value share of the market has actually gone up,” says Ganti.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Gap analysis</b><br>
				The company identified gaps in various other product categories 
				to consolidate its presence. For example, in the HA market, 
				SARCO realised that it was weak in the air conditioners, which 
				accounted for 50 per cent of the HA market. It’s Korean rival LG 
				accounted for almost 50 per cent of the market. SARCO started 
				consolidating its presence in the B2B market by tying up with 
				contractors. A big breakthrough came in 2008 when it got a bulk 
				order for supplying 1000 window ACs, and since then there has 
				been no looking back. <br>
				<br>
				In a price sensitive category like refrigerators, where a five 
				to ten rial difference could sway a customer, SARCO found that 
				most of the competition was in the 300 litre segment and it 
				started focussing on the 200-300 litre segment. Secondly, while 
				its competitors were focussed on Carrefour, Samsung started 
				concentrating on LuLu, KM Trading and Safeer hypermarket to 
				diversify its presence. Similarly, in the mobile phone market, 
				which was dominated by Nokia owing to its low-value products 
				(with an average sale price of $50), Samsung started focusing on 
				the mid to the smart phone end of the business, which was priced 
				at RO40 ($100) and above. It also took up exclusive mobile 
				kiosks at LuLu and the phones were priced at as close to the 
				grey market as possible. The company today has 25 standalone 
				mobile kiosks and is planning to increase this to 50 by the end 
				of this year. <br>
				<br>
				The company has invested RO100,000 in a 1,100 square metre 
				state-of-the-art service centre in Ghala. SARCO has opened a 
				service centre in Sohar and its facility in Salalah is being 
				upgraded. All Samsung products come with a five-year warranty 
				and the company is working on providing the best in class after 
				sales service. The company has also invested in training and 
				developing its Omani workforce over the last two years. Says 
				Ganti, “We have more Omanis than expatriates in our sales 
				force.”<br>
				<br>
				SARCO has also rode the wave of Samsung’s global success. Moving 
				ahead the company wants to strengthen its retail presence across 
				the country, decrease its volume dependence, enhance its value 
				share of the market and be a one stop shop for consumer needs in 
				the AV and HA business. If the past success of SARCO is anything 
				to go by, one can rest assured that it will surely deliver on 
				this promise.&#8194;</td>

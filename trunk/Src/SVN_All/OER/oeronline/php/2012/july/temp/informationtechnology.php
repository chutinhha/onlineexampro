						Analysts at the Gartner Enterprise Architecture Summit 
						2012 reiterated the need for Enterprise Architecture to 
						become business outcome-driven. Mayank Singh reports 
						from London<br>

						<font face="Verdana" size="1">Adisconnect remains 
						between the way many organisations pursue Enterprise 
						Architecture (EA) and the impact of EA on the business, 
						which prevents EA from delivering business value, 
						according to Gartner, Inc. EA practitioners need to 
						re-examine old practices and shift their focus to 
						deliverables that direct change and empower business and 
						IT leaders to make better decisions. This was one of the 
						big themes discussed at the Gartner Enterprise 
						Architecture Summit 2012 (EAS) held in London, recently.
						<br>
						<br>
						The summit presented a unique confluence of disruptive 
						trends from the nexus of cloud, social, big data and how 
						mobile technologies are providing an unprecedented 
						opportunity for EA practitioners to deliver business 
						value from EA better than ever before. The summit not 
						only helped organisations to navigate the nexus of 
						change to deliver business value, growth and 
						transformation, but also gave them a roadmap to master 
						their core EA competencies that are essential for EA 
						success. <br>
						<br>
						“Focusing on a standard EA framework doesn’t work,” said 
						Brian Burke, research vice president at Gartner. “In the 
						past EA practitioners focused on deliverables that were 
						useful to enterprise architects but not valuable to 
						senior management and/or did not respond to a specific 
						business or IT need.”<br>
						<br>
						“We’ve witnessed a change in mind-set, execution and 
						delivery of EA. The value of EA is not in simply ‘doing 
						EA’, but rather in how it can help evolve the business 
						and enable senior executives to respond to business 
						threats and opportunities,” said Burke. “EA leaders must 
						shift their focus to create actionable and measurable 
						deliverables that address specific business outcomes and 
						work with other business and IT disciplines such as 
						business process management (BPM), programme and 
						portfolio management (PPM), business information (BI), 
						finance and human resources to leverage their efforts 
						and move to value-driven EA.”<br>
						<br>
						Gartner has categorised five types of deliverables that 
						will help EA practitioners deliver business value from 
						EA efforts. “EA practitioners need to find the right 
						balance of resource investment (time, energy and money) 
						between all of these deliverables, while understanding 
						that stakeholders only value actionable and measurable 
						deliverables,” said Burke.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Measurable Deliverables<br>
						</b>Measurable deliverables specifically measure the 
						direct impact of EA on the business. Currently, less 
						than 44 per cent of EA organisations worldwide have 
						defined metrics and even fewer are focusing metrics on 
						business outcomes. It’s often the case that many of 
						these organisations measure what an EA team is doing, 
						for example how many deliverables created rather than 
						gauging the impact of EA on the business. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Actionable Deliverables<br>
						</b>Actionable deliverables drive change and must have a 
						direct relationship to business outcomes and stakeholder 
						requirements. Actionable deliverables present senior IT 
						or business executives with a decision to be made or a 
						specific action to be taken that moves the business 
						toward a future state. Because actionable deliverables 
						must invoke some change, they are easily measured - did 
						the recommended change occur or not? <br>
						<br>
						<b>Diagnostic Deliverables<br>
						</b>Diagnostic deliverables include models, requirements 
						and analysis tools that are designed to enable IT and 
						business leaders to understand the impact of different 
						decisions made in response to business disruption or 
						business opportunity. Diagnostic deliverables combine 
						different views of a problem or opportunity to address a 
						specific need. For example, for a durable goods 
						manufacturing organisation that is trying to make a 
						business and IT investment decisions on a new 
						market/product opportunity, diagnostic deliverables 
						might include an illustration of the critical affected 
						business capabilities using a business capability model.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Enabling Deliverables<br>
						</b>Enabling deliverables are composed of information 
						that is collected; they provide input to diagnostic 
						deliverables that represent the business, people, 
						processes, information and technology. For years, these 
						have been considered the primary deliverables of EA. 
						Enabling deliverables are collected from existing 
						information sources, such as performance metrics, 
						reports from PPM, or a business process diagram from 
						BPM. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Operational Deliverables<br>
						</b>Operational deliverables are the artefacts that EA 
						practitioners use to help them define, communicate and 
						run their EA programme. These deliverables are largely 
						focused on defining what EA practitioners “do,” and on 
						positioning EA goals and governance structures. Examples 
						of these operational deliverables are in the EA team 
						charter, the EA steering committee and architectural 
						review board charter.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						The other big theme of the summit was how EA 
						practitioners can play a major role in ensuring their 
						organisations maximise the business opportunities posed 
						by big data. Big data makes organisations smarter and 
						more productive by enabling people to harness diverse 
						data types previously unavailable, and to find 
						previously unseen opportunities. However, Gartner 
						analysts said big data poses big challenges as well – 
						and that’s where enterprise architects can help. As 
						navigators of strategic change, the task for EA 
						practitioners is to chart the right course for big data 
						across the most critical dimensions of the organisation: 
						business, culture, talent and technology.<br>
						<br>
						“Traditional approaches to EA are significantly impacted 
						by big data,” said David Newman, research vice president 
						at Gartner. “For the EA practitioner, the balance shifts 
						from a focus on optimisation and standardisation within 
						the organisation, to lightweight approaches that focus 
						on harmonisation and externalisation across the broader 
						enterprise ecosystem. Big data disrupts traditional 
						information architectures – from a focus on data 
						warehousing (data storage and compression) toward data 
						pooling (flows, links, and information shareability). In 
						the age of big data, the task for the EA practitioner is 
						clear: Design business outcomes that exploit big data 
						opportunities inside and outside the organisation.<br>
						<br>
						Big data enables decision makers to spot patterns 
						quickly across different data types, but requires a 
						data-savvy business strategy to achieve competitive 
						advantage. Enterprise architects should educate leaders 
						about potential big data opportunities now readily 
						available through start-small, cost-effective analytics 
						and pattern recognition tools and techniques, but also 
						explain the risk factors (such as data privacy, 
						regulatory and legal challenges). Practitioners should 
						also explore the increasing number of public datasets 
						now available through open APIs, and use these for 
						sentiment analysis (e.g., mining social media feeds), 
						location-based services (using publicly available 
						telemetry data) or to design context-aware applications.

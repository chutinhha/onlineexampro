				<b>Rami Al Lawati and Huda Al Lawati stepped out of their

				years has become one of the leading digital media and creative 
				production companies in Oman. Reports Muhammed Nafie</b><p align="center" class="style13" dir="ltr">

				<br>
				It requires tremendous amount of self-confidence and 
				determination to leave the comfort zone of a rewarding and 
				respectable profession to venture into an own enterprise, 
				especially if it means starting upon a less trodeen path. Only 
				dedicated and passionate self-starters can brace themselves for 
				the vagaries of uncharted territories they step into. For Rami 
				Al Lawati and his wife Huda Al Lawati, it was their 
				entrepreneurial zeal and passion for professional photography 
				and creative designing that prompted them to start Proshots 
				Digital Media and Art Centre, in February 2009. While Rami gave 
				up his job as an accountant with Omantel, Huda joined him 
				forsaking her career as a lecture at Higher College of 
				Technology. Within a short span of three years, the couple 
				managed to expand their venture from a studio to a multifaceted 
				digital media and arts centre with focus on photography, 
				videography, digital production, special effects, 3D animation 
				design, framing etc.<br>
				<br>
				Rami who firmly believes in the adage ‘nothing ventured, nothing 
				gained’, describes his decision to switch over to photography, 
				his lifelong passion, as the most difficult but one of the best 
				choices he has ever taken. “When I decided what I had to do, I 
				proceeded in that direction. I did my Master’s from UK in 
				business administration and completed various short courses and 
				workshops in design, 3D animation, videography to equip myself 
				for it.”<br>
				<br>
				Powered by a Master’s in 3D animation and special effects and a 
				Bachelor’s in IT, Huda had already made up her mind for the 
				transition. “I am more into creative and design, while he is 
				more business oriented. I learned a lot from the university of 
				life through him. The shift from being an employee to become 
				your own boss and to do things that you like is a big 
				challenge.”<br>
				<br>
				Rami adds, “To start and own a business requires more energy, 
				more time, more knowledge and more planning than being an 
				employee for someone.” He says it has been a successful, albeit 
				challenging, journey. “We started as a photography studio but 
				could expand our wing to production, design, print media etc. 
				and emerge as one of the leading companies in Oman both in 
				production and photography. I am looking for more competition in 
				the market so that things will become easier for us.”<br>
				<br>
				ProShots offers a wide range of retail and corporate services 
				such as photography and videography for weddings and birthdays 
				and album making to media coverage, awareness messages, 
				commercial advertisement, documentaries, framing etc. Its fast 
				growing clientele includes various ministries and some of the 
				largest corporates and banks in the country.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Change of perception<br>
				</b>ProShots accords more importance to impeccable 
				professionalism and high-quality services. Huda says though 
				there are commercially very few players in the market people are 
				getting more serious about video production. “Unlike ten years 
				ago when people hardly bothered about the quality of the 
				production and looked for cheaper options, now they have 
				understood the value of quality products. They came to realise 
				that quality matters.”<br>
				<br>
				While Huda attributes the success of their venture to the 
				ability to think out of box and apply more innovative and 
				artistic ideas, Rami highlights the significance of doing 
				researches to understand the requirements and the latest trends 
				of the market.&#8194;<br>

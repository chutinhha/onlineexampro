						by the Gold Fin, an anti-corrosion coating, which makes 
						the heat exchanger more resistant to corrosion.<br>
						<br>
						Unique healthcare features have been added to the Titan 
						series, in order to provide customers with the most 
						comfortable and relaxing home environment. The air 
						projected from the Titan series is purified, thanks to 
						the Auto Cleaning function, which also sterilizes the 
						air conditioner’s interior to prevent the formation of 
						molds and bacteria. Health risks are significantly 
						reduced by the Allergy &amp; Virus Safe filter, which 
						eliminates allergen, apatite and binder, as well as 99.9 
						percent of H1N1 viruses over the course of 24 hours. 
						Meanwhile, the Triple filter reduces allergy symptoms 
						and removes unpleasant odors, and the Plasmaster filter 
						reduces microscopic contaminants and dust, as well as 
						house mites, micro dust and pet fur.<br>
						<br>
						Complementing LG’s product innovations are OTE Group’s 
						efforts in all areas of sales, distribution, service and 
						understanding of the local audience. Caring for 
						customers has been LG &amp; OTE’s top priority, whereby 
						customers are treated with care and issues handled with 
						speed and accuracy. LG &amp; OTE Group have introduced Day 
						And Night Customer Service - first of its kind in Oman 
						where customers can benefit from the service from 8 am – 
						12 midnight, a year back. The initiative is aimed at 
						providing quality service for the excellent value that 
						LG products offer and what homeowners deserve and expect 
						from the comfort of their homes. <br>
						<br>
						OTE Group is a part of the social fabric in Oman and 
						hence customer satisfaction is its top priority. It is 
						this philosophy of team OTE that goes beyond market 
						share and profits to come together and make OTE – A 
						Symbol of Care. OTE Group is the exclusive dealer of LG 
						range of electronics and home appliances in Oman. With a 
						nationwide network of showrooms and service facilities, 
						OTE Group ensures that LG customers are never far from

				<b>Looking at supply chain management from a mathematical 
				perspective throws up some interesting insights<br>
				<br>
				By Ambuj Khare and Anurag Saxena<br>
				</b><br>
				<br>
				In today’s world one has to compete globally and not locally 
				like yesteryears. The world today has become so nimble that it 
				is continuously changing and becoming more complex and 
				competitive. Businesses in the information age must accept these 
				changes and be ready to be more competitive and 
				customer-focused. There is a global competition for labour and 
				trade and operations are now supposed to be performed in 
				real-time. Customers are demanding detailed information about 
				products and services. Companies are facing problems in 
				producing superior products in less resources and information is 
				becoming critical for management decision-making. Owing to these 
				pressures many companies are planning to reap the benefits of 
				alliances with other companies. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is 
				responsible for looking after such alliances and it seeks to 
				make every step in the chain as efficient as possible by 
				ensuring good coordination between the alliances.<br>
				<br>
				The term Supply Chain Management (SCM) came to light in the 
				1980s. The intent of using this term was to express the need to 
				integrate the key business processes, from end user through 
				suppliers. SCM enables companies and corporations to get 
				involved and work in a cohesive manner for the benefit of 
				customer as well as themselves. A supply chain entails raw 
				materials, suppliers, manufacturing, distribution, customers and 
				consumers. Material from supplier to customer moves on in the 
				supply chain and it is believed that a smooth flow of these 
				materials only depicts the health of the supply chain. However 
				in reality a supply chain entails movement from and to many 
				warehouses. There are many steps involved, many inventories 
				maintained and lot of time consumed. SCM is actually so big that 
				it can be difficult to exemplify each and every component of it. 
				On a bigger canvas, the function of supply chain is to plan, 
				organise, coordinate and control almost all the activities of 
				the company.<br>
				<br>
				Let us revisit some of the terms commonly used in the supply 
				chain scenario. See Table 1 to get a brief description of those 
				terms.<br>
				<br>
				Let us take some key terms commonly used in the supply chain and 
				do a little bit of mathematics on them. Let us see what these 
				terms mean for the supply chain from a mathematical perspective. 
				In Table 2 we have added the digit score (the position at which 
				it appears in the English alphabets) of each of these terms and 
				then taken the sum as the percentage of the sum of digit scores 
				of the term “supply chain”. If we take the sum percentage as the 
				relative importance for the supply chain, the results are 
				absolutely attention grabbing. We can see what these terms mean 
				for the supply chain from the “additive” perspective.<br>
				<br>
				So if one wishes to choose 10 commandants of supply chain 
				management they would be inventory, effectiveness, cross 
				docking, information, operations, customers, integration, 
				strategy, performance and logistics. Let us discuss inventory 
				(relative importance 99 per cent) first; inventory is a list of 
				things held in stocks. If a company has high inventory costs and 
				no synchronisation between stocks and demand, its products are 
				bound to have higher costs and thus the business will be in a 
				bad position.<br>
				<br>
				A company could be very efficient but what matters more at the 
				end of the day is effectiveness (relative importance 96 per 
				cent) as effectiveness means doing the right things to create 
				the most value for the company. Eventual goal of any business is 
				to satisfy the customer. Next is cross docking (relative 
				importance 95 per cent), which is often used to maintain low 
				level of inventory. Retailers like Wal-Mart have shown the 
				benefits of using cross docking. Information (relative 
				importance 93 per cent) is the ability to furnish critical data 
				on product performance, process parameters and cost to internal 
				groups and to external customers value of information can never 
				be ignored. It is said that in a supply chain information flow 
				is as important as the product flow. Effective operations 
				(relative importance 92 per cent) are again the core of supply 
				chain as they are the systems that create and deliver the firm’s 
				primary products and services. If operations are the core then 
				customers (relative importance 92 per cent) are the essence as 
				they are the ones that purchase goods and services that are 
				provided through a supply chain. <br>
				<br>
				Further, a supply chain revolves around efficient integration 
				(relative importance 92 per cent) of suppliers, manufacturers, 
				warehouses and stores. Strategy (relative importance 80 per 
				cent) means deliberately choosing a different set of activities 
				to deliver a unique mix of value. It is used to define supply 
				chain objectives. Performance (relative importance 79 per cent) 
				describes the way in which a company performs and is indicative 
				of supply chain health. And finally for logistics (relative 
				importance 78 per cent), we can quote Strahan and Bodegraven 
				(2004), “supply chain management and logistics are part of the 
				same solution set, one filling the gaps, and one closing them. 
				It is possible to have passable logistics without supply chain 
				management. <br>
				<br>
				It is not possible to have a great supply chain without also 
				having terrific logistics”.<br>
				<br>
				If one further probes into the multiplicative effect of the 
				digits of these terms then we find something even more 
				interesting. In Table 3 we can see what these terms mean for the 
				supply chain from the “multiplicative” perspective.It is said 
				that numbers are better tools than words if are making a 
				business decision. We have thus reinforced the words/ terms 
				commonly encountered in a retail supply chain with the help of 
				numbers.&#8194;<br>

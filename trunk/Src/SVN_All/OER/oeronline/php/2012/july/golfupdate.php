					the 100 highest paid athletes</font></b><p align="justify" class="style13">

				<img border="0" src="http://www.oeronline.com/images/golfupdate-logo.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #808080; float: right;">After 
				an 11-year reign, Tiger Woods has been deposed as sport’s 
				highest earner. No longer golf’s world No1, Woods has slipped to 
				third in the world’s 100 highest-paid athletes list conducted by 
				Forbes – behind two boxers, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. 
				The once golden golfer took in over $59mn in earnings and 
				endorsements over the past 12 months. But that’s just half of 
				what he earned in his peak year of 2009 – the annus horribilis 
				that saw a sex scandal start to eat away at his advertising 
				portfolio and once dominant game.<br>
				<br>
				Mayweather, the undefeated US fighter, collected a total of 
				$85mn for his two fights with Victor Ortiz and Miguel Cotto over 
				the survey period. That brought him out on top of fellow boxer 
				Manny Pacquiao. The Filipino fighter collected some $62mn in 
				earnings and endorsements. “There’s a reason they call boxer 
				Floyd Mayweather ‘Money’,” said Forbes’ senior editor Kurt 
				Badenhausen. “He fought twice during the past 12 months, spent 
				less than one hour in the ring to dispatch his two foes – his 
				combined payday for the bouts: $85mn.<br>
				<br>
				Miami Heat star LeBron James came in fourth in the magazine’s 
				rankings with $53mn, the most of any of the 13 basketball 
				players making the cut. Swiss tennis star Roger Federer was 
				fifth at $52.7mn followed by NBA star Kobe Bryant at $52.3mn, US 
				golfer Phil Mickelson at $47.8mn, English soccer star David 
				Beckham of the Los Angeles Galaxy at $46mn and Portuguese soccer 
				star Cristiano Ronaldo at $42.5mn. Golf’s current world No1 Luke 
				Donald is at 48th position.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Inconsistent performance<br>
				</b>The last month also saw Webb Simpson emerge as the golf’s 
				2012 US Open champion at the Olympic Club, surging past the 
				seven players in front of him on the last day, shooting a 
				2-under 68 and claiming a one-stroke victory. Woods’s early good 
				work at the Olympic Club that was to signal a glorious return 
				turned to dust on the final day. “I’m definitely still in the 
				ball game. I’m only five back and that’s certainly do-able on 
				this golf course for sure,” the world No4 said after signing for 
				a five-over-par 75. That dropped him out of the lead, leaving 
				him five shots adrift of the overnight leaders, Graeme McDowell 
				and Jim Furyk. <br>
				<br>
				“It’s all about patience,” said Woods. “It’s just a few birdies 
				here and there. It’s not like where you have to go out there and 
				shoot 62 or 63. This is a US Open. You just need to hang around. 
				First you need to get off to a good start. Get through the first 
				six. Because anything can happen at the last three holes.”<br>
				<br>
				That week was meant to mark the great man’s return to centre 
				stage, a renewal of his assault on Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 
				major championships. Instead, it served only to give succour to 
				those who believe Woods will never climb to the top of that 
				particular mountain. Tiger limped home with closing rounds of 75 
				and 73 to finish T-21, a far cry from the lofty expectations he 
				had created after winning the Memorial Tournament just two weeks 
				prior. Woods has not won a major since the US Open at Torrey 
				Pines in 2008.&#8194;</font></td>

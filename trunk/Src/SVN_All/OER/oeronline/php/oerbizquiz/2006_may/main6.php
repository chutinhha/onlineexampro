a complete change in airline business dynamics, Gulf Air enjoys a very high 
brand awareness and recall among air travelers and trade circles the world over, 
especially in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, South East Asia and West 
Europe. It has faced numerous challenges in its journey but it has always 
managed to bounce back, only to retract again. With another round of change in 
ownership and a new three-year growth strategy in place, the US$1.3 billion 
carrier is striving to build on its recent gains in an age which its President &amp; 
Chief Executive James Hogan calls “times of unfair competition”.<br>
<br>
“Today we are ranked among the world’s top ten airlines in products and 
services. We have been making record gains in revenues and traffic and winning 
industry accolades. Despite that, in 2005, we were back among losses due to very 
high fuel costs. In 2002, fuel accounted for 14 per cent of our cost. Today, it 
is a staggering 31 per cent of our cost,” informs Hogan. <br>
<br>
An industry analyst adds, “Gulf Air is perhaps the best managed airline in the 
region but the high fuel bill will continue to affect its bottom line. A number 
of other leading airlines in the region have the advantage of “fuel hedging” 
which means they are either not required to pay for their fuel bills or they get 
fuel at highly subsidized rates from their respective governments. Fuel hedging 
enables them to invest heavily in building capacity and introducing price cuts 
to drive other carriers out of business.”<br>

As a sequel to Project Falcon (see box ‘Chequered History’ for more on Project 
Falcon), Gulf Air has adopted a new three-year strategic plan “Smart Airline, 
Successful Business”. It entails significant investment for the 
re-capitalization of the airline, re-equipment of the fleet, product upgrades 
and refurbishment of present aircraft, and investment in a range of areas of the 
business.<br>
<br>
Gulf Air, in the advent of Abu Dhabi’s withdrawal, has initiated a two-hub 
policy focusing on Bahrain and Muscat. “The new two-hub strategy will result in 
significant cost reductions and bring about major improvements to our key 
operational indicators, including punctuality, as we will have greater fleet 
flexibility and an even more effective set of connections,” says Hogan.<br>
<br>
On being queried whether he is under pressure to make more use of Muscat as the 
other important hub, Hogan replies, “All our decisions are based on sound 
commercial basis. In my view, Oman is the most exciting tourism destination in 
the entire region. The increased influx of tourists and expansion in hotel 
capacities is a testimony to the tourism potential of Oman.”<br>
<br>
A consortium of lenders, including Commercial Bank of Qatar, First Commercial 
Bank — Singapore, National Bank of Oman, State Bank of India — Bahrain, Persia 
International Bank, and The Arab Investment Company, will extend credit 
facilities valued at US$75 million, repayable over a period of three years, to 
Gulf Air. <br>
<br>
The airline has invested in the US$10 million state-of-the-art simulator center 
at Bahrain recently. The airline has also signed an agreement for the provision 
and installation of new First and Business Class seats in its Airbus A340 
aircraft and the simultaneous refurbishment of the aircraft interiors to match 
the standards of the award-winning A330 fleet. Gulf Air will also install new 
in-flight entertainment systems during the year. In addition, the airline is 
expected to invest at least US$1 billion in acquiring new wide body aircraft 
from either Boeing or Airbus. A decision to this effect is expected by May or 
June this year.</font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Focus on Oman</b><br>
With the withdrawal of Abu Dhabi, Oman now controls 50 per cent of Gulf Air’s 
shareholding. As a result, the airline is focusing on its Oman operations in a 
major way. Gulf Air is already running its call center, with a seating capacity 
of 300 to cater to the global requirements. It is located at Knowledge Oasis 
Muscat (KOM). The airline has also signed an MoU to make Swiss-based SR Technics 
Holding assume total responsibility for the maintenance, repair and operation of 
the airline’s fleet in a five-year contract valued at US$750 million. It 
includes the establishment of an aircraft maintenance facility and training 
centre based in Oman. The Oman based US$50 million three-bay hangar and 
maintenance facility in which Gulf Air will have a 10 per cent shareholding, 
will provide maintenance solutions based on customer requirements, include 
aircraft and component services, technical training, logistics, on-wing and 
light engine services and engineering for Gulf Air and other third party 
customers. <br>
<br>
Talking about the benefits Gulf Air will bring on the table for Oman, HE Shaikh 
Mohammed Al Harthy, the Minister of Transport of Oman, says: “The cumulative 
benefits to the local economy are significant with suggested estimates of at 
least one per cent to the GDP of the Sultanate. When fully operational, the 
joint venture will create jobs for 850 skilled and professional people over the 
initial five-year period. In addition to the enormous employment opportunities, 
the venture presents for Omanis, a subsidiary maintenance training center, which 
will also offer world-class technical training for airline maintenance engineers 
and technicians for the regional industry. It will also create an environment in 
which downstream businesses and industries can develop and flourish, generating 
further revenue and employment opportunities.” </font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Gulf Air has added 69 
more flights from its Muscat hub as part of its summer schedule. Shane O’Hare, 
Head of Marketing, Gulf Air says, “This makes a total of 195 flights per week 
flying out of Muscat from the earlier 126 flights per week. Together with our 
code share partner Oman Air, we now offer more than 330 flights from Muscat per 
week. So Gulf Air takes the travelers to GCC destinations, the Middle East, Far 
East, the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Europe, with a wide range of options.”<br>
<br>
In terms of traffic, Gulf Air flew 1.6 million passengers through Seeb Airport 
in 2005. And this figure is expected to grow to 2.6 million in 2006, accounting 
for 55 per cent of the Seeb Airport activity. <br>
<br>
But from where does the additional traffic to Muscat is expected to come? O’Hare 
responds: “With a wider connectivity, we are expecting a huge spike in traffic 
volume — both local as well as transit. In terms of value, our focus is on 
premium segment, comprising of first class and business class segments, which 
contributes more than 80 per cent of our profits.” <br>
<br>
To strengthen itself as the national carrier of Oman, Gulf Air has embarked on a 
major marketing exercise in the Sultanate. It was the gold sponsor of the Muscat 
Festival 2006. It is sponsoring a number of other local programmes to touch the 
lives of Omanis. For the first time, Gulf Air organised its top management 
conference in Oman recently. The airline is expected to announce a major 
initiative in May to strengthen its bonding with Oman.<br>
<b><br>
Stumbling Blocks</b><br>
Despite scoring highly on the management front, Hogan and his 5,700 plus strong 
team, drawn from 62 different nationalities, face numerous challenges. Like 
Qatar and Abu Dhabi, Oman also has a separate national carrier — Oman Air. What 
is the guarantee that Oman will not pull out from the airline like the other 
two? An industry analyst says, “From the commercial angle, it doesn’t make sense 
for Oman to keep investing in two different airlines simultaneously. Either 
there has to be a clear demarcation in their product offerings or they should 
take the merger route to align their strengths.”<br>
<br>
Hogan refuses to be drawn into this controversial, but important question. He 
comments: “It is up to the shareholders to decide on the future of Gulf Air and 
Oman Air. I cannot comment on this. As of now, we see clear synergy between the 
two airlines. We don’t compete with each other. Rather, we complement each other 
quite well.” <br>
<br>
With other airlines from the region strongly supported by their much stronger 
economies, facing the (unfair) competition will be a tough task for Gulf Air. 
Unlike Gulf Air, a number of other airlines can afford to sink billions of 
dollars in network expansion and aggressive marketing, thanks to fuel hedging 
and support of their respective governments. <br>
<br>
Though Oman holds a great potential as a tourism destination, its infrastructure 
— including airport and hotels — will take a few more years to expand 
substantially. However, Hogan is unfazed. “We have done it before. We are much 
better equipped to meet the challenge than ever before. We will further build on 
our reputation as the leading regional carrier.” </font></p>

    Gulf Aviation Company, the forerunner of Gulf Air, was born in 1950 with the 
    suppor</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">t of the ruler of Bahrain. It was the brainchild of former Royal Air 
    Force (UK) pilot Freddie Bossworth. British Overseas Aircraft Corporation 
    (BOAC) took over the operations management of the company in 1951. For the 
    next two decades, the company continued to grow its network by acquiring new 
    aircraft and extending flights to new destinations to connect the Gulf 
    region with the rest of the world. <br>
    <br>
    In a related development, the British pulled out of the region and the 
    former British Protectorate States of Bahrain and Qatar, and the Trucial 
    States (now part of the United Arab Emirates) declared Independence. 
    Consequently, the governments of Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Abu Dhabi took 
    over the ownership of the company from BOAC. The company was renamed ‘Gulf 
    Air’, the national carrier of the four states in 1974. At the same time, 
    OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) began raising the 
    oil prices, which led to a major economic boom in the Gulf region.<br>
    <br>
    If the ’70s was the great boom time for the airline, the 80s provided a 
    bumpier ride. It suffered losses in 1986 and 1987. The recession in the 90s, 
    which had gripped the international airline industry, had a serious effect 
    on Gulf Air too, despite the airline’s long-term plan to avoid it. 
    Profitability fell and debt kept on mounting. In 1996, a two-year target was 
    worked out to return the airline to profitability. Tough measures were 
    implemented, including the closure of low-yield routes, and disposal of 
    aircraft and some subsidiary shareholdings. The airline returned to 
    operating profit in 1998, aided by a massive reduction in debt. <br>
    <br>
    Gulf Air celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2000. But even before the 
    celebrations could die down, troubles were back. To arrest the downslide and 
    change the fortune of Gulf Air, James Hogan was appointed as the new 
    President and Chief Executive of the airline. <br>
    <b><br>
    Signs of turnaround</b><br>
    Despite his good track record, Hogan, the tough Aussie, had an enormous task 
    on his hand. Gulf Air was pushed to rank 72 among the list of top airlines 
    in the world. To make matters worse, Qatar, predictably, pulled out of the 
    ownership to focus on its own national carrier, Qatar Airways. Gulf Air 
    ended 2002 with losses of US$110 million. <br>
    <br>
    Hogan introduced the three-year restructuring and turnaround programme named 
    ‘Project Falcon’. More than US$238 million was injected into the airline by 
    the three owner states in 2003 and government debt continued to be deferred. 
    “We focused on the pillars of the recovery plan, including brand 
    development, fleet re-construction, network, alliances and customer service 
    etc. There was a strong focus on profitability and improvements to cost 
    structures,” Hogan informs. <br>
    <br>
    In 2003, a new corporate identity, devised in conjunction with leading brand 
    consultancy Landor, was unveiled as part of the progressive change 
    management programme. “The re-styled falcon, which remains the focal point 
    of our new corporate identity, communicates a synthesis of bold, modern 
    entrepreneurial principles and traditional Arabian values, in what we 
    believe is a powerful prominent icon for a new era,” says Hogan.<br>
    <br>
    The rebranding was one of the several initiatives which helped Gulf Air to 
    get back in black again after a gap of six years, recording a profit of US$4 
    million in 2004 against a loss of US$52.8 million in 2003. But just when it 
    seemed the airline was back on track to regain its lost glory, disaster 
    struck again. In 2005, Abu Dhabi gave up the ownership to concentrate on its 
    own national carrier, Etihad Airways. <br>
    <br>
    External factors have continued to make the operating environment more 
    turbulent for Gulf Air. Developments such as the ongoing conflict in Iraq, 
    weak US dollar, spiraling fuel cost, and increased competition from new 
    low-cost airlines and existing regional and global carriers are casting a 
    dark shadow on the financial performance of the airline. However, as the 
    saying goes, “where there is a will, there is way.” And going by its track 
    record, it will be no surprise if Gulf Air manages yet another turnaround.

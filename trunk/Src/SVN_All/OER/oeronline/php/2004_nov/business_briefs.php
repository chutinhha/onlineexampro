Future Event, in association with Omantel and Scanit Middle East, is

The conference (December 11-12) being
held under the patronage of Hamood

be an open forum for discussing the
future banking and financial technology

The meet is expected to moot the
possibilities of establishing a regional
security benchmark to which banks can
subscribe. Bankers, financial sector captains
and IT specialists from all over the
world will attend the conference. The
conference is expected to be a major step
towards arriving at a definition of a security
benchmark for e-banking. It will also
explore the technology that will secure
the e-business strategies for both traditional
commercial banking and investment
deals. The conference is expected
to provide a venue to cement existing
business opportunities as well as develop
new business opportunities for keydecision
makers in both finance and
technology communities. The speaker
panel includes Dr Simon Moores, a leading
e-adviser; Tony Neate, chief executive
of UK’s National Hi-Tech Crime

net profit rises 18 pc

The impact of erstwhile Majan
International Bank’s merger with
BankDhofar has started reflecting in
the books of the latter. BankDhofar
reported nearly 18 per cent jump in net
profit for the first nine months of the
current year ended September 30, 2004.
The net profit rose from RO7.087 million
in September 2003 to RO8.351 million
in September 2004. When most
banks post fall in loan book size,
BankDhofar shows signs of continuous
increase. Loans and advances witnessed
an increase of 6.5 per cent at
RO378.66 million as against RO355.65
million as of September-end 2003. Of
course, fall in loan book size, in the
case of some banks, was because of
cautious lending policies. The increase
in profitability can be attributed to the
9.5 per cent increase in gross interest
income and a 10.8 per cent increase in
net interest income, despite a 5.3 per
cent increase in interest expenses. Total
assets registered an increase of 7.45 per

Famous British adventurer Mark Evans

December and the other, next December.
The journey, entitled ‘Around Oman

the Omani government, who will be marketing
the event to promote the country
as an adventure tourism destination via a
website and targeted media and advertising
initiatives in the Gulf region and the
UK. “The other significance of this sea
adventure is that it will attempt to raise
funds for the Oman Cancer Group, the
only group of its kind in Oman which is
spreading cancer awareness in the country,”
Mark said. The well-known British
adventurer is set to paddle around 1,700
km of coastline to highlight Sultanate’s
great tourism potential and to raise funds
for Oman Cancer Group. This adventure
trip gains great significance, for it is
almost timing with His Majesty Sultan
Qaboos’s recent statement where he had
stressed on raising Oman's tourism
potential. His Majesty the Sultan had
underlined the need to take advantage of
the natural diversity and geographical
location of the Sultanate, by way of
tourism to add to the national revenue.
This journey has all the potential to bring
the Sultanate out into the open as a country
of great tourism potential, Mark and

bill payment and make the process easier

bring in more foreign investments,
more transfer of technology and
result in more and better jobs for Omanis, HE Maqbool bin Ali Sultan,

of this was the loss of jobs in some
sectors, the minister noted. “There
would, of course, be job losses in some
sectors, which are not efficient and not
competitive.” But there were methods
to overcome that. Not only that, an
effective balance would be made by the
emergence of other new jobs in the
horizon, which will rush in to fill in
any vacuum, he promised. The minister
noted that the job losses in some of
the sectors would be “more than compensated
by the additional jobs created
in sectors that, under the WTO
impulse, would become more efficient
and competitive. It is worth mentioning
that there has been a heightened
interest among foreign services suppliers
to invest in Oman, following the
liberalisation of the services sector,
resulting from the accession commitments,
HE Sultan noted.

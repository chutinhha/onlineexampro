            is an activity on rise, with 80 per cent of the browsers being 
            males, according to a recent AC Nielsen survey. The proportion of 
            females accessing the net is highest in Bahrain, the UAE, Kuwait and 
            Lebanon (approx 30 per cent). The 20-29 age groups are the largest 
            segment accessing the Internet, with the average age being 26 years 
            across the region. More than 1.5 million Internet users have shopped 
            online, with penetration highest in the UAE (32 per cent). Egypt, 
            KSA and the UAE have more than one million users who have shopped 
            online. The intention to shop on the web is also respectable, with 
            more than 20 per cent inclined to shop online. Most users currently 
            own a computer. More than 2.5 million people in the region are 
            planning to buy, replace or upgrade their computer in the next year. 
            The main brands for computers and computer accessories are LG, HP,

            transactions and to keep your investments safe. For reasons of

            might be in serious danger of losing important data. An Internet

            targeting bank customers around the world and fooling them into 
            revealing personal account details. “It is the easiest, newest and 
            cheapest way by making use of the electronic mail and the Internet 
            to fool people, especially when Internet banking is widely promoted 
            by every bank”, he said. The scamsters’ modus operandi is to use an 
            electronic e-mail to trick the recipient into revealing his critical 
            information. Customers from four major Australian banks — ANZ, 
            Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac — were fooled 
            by such e-mails. “The e-mails appear and look as though they are 
            coming from the bank and alerts the customer to the fact that a 
            certain amount of money has been transferred out of his account. The 
            e-mail provides a link as well. This link takes the user to a 
            genuine looking bank website where the user is asked to fill in 
            their Internet banking account details. The site is nothing but a 
            fake one although it is designed to look identical.</font></p>

            Have you heard about the human assets in your company? If yes, it’s 
            the time to invest in them. And to make it possible MINA Solutions 
            has partnered with US-based Saba to bring new human development 
            software called Human Capital Development and Manageability (HCDM). 
            This software helps identify the skills and knowledge of employees 
            and helps manage their competency development. Emphasising today’s 
            ‘knowledge economy’, MINA Solutions has been marketing this software 
            from business to business, initially looking at oil and 
            petrochemical companies but moving into the financial, tourism and 
            hospitality sectors. Cisco and Schlumberger have already implemented 
            HCDM in their system networks. The human resources software is 
            internet-based and is focused on employee knowledge management. ERP 
            and CRM gather information. HCDM is attempting to go a step above 
            this function through the customisation and personalisation of the 
            service. After the implementations of the program, MINA Solutions 
            employees will still give continued hands-on assistance in the 
            implementations and management of the software.</font></p>

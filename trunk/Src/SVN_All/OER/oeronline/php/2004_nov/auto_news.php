        The Lexus LS 460 had already bagged the prestigious ‘2007 Japan Car of 
        the Year’ early on. LS460 won this award after a meticulous selection 
        process from an entry list of 28 formidable contenders from all 
        Japanese, European and US luxury makes. Lexus LS 460 shone because the 
        WCOTY jurors considered the car to be “the embodiment of the Lexus 
        brand’s motto – the pursuit of perfection” and “classically luxurious, 
        with modern execution, unquestioned quality and more than ample power”. 
        The jurors also praised the Lexus for including a novel automatic 
        parking system and an 8-speed auto transmission, which helped it pip 
        nearest rivals to claim first place.<br>

        exciting evening extravaganza for all the participants and their

        the new model integrates all of SEAT’s expertise in creating cars with 
        an overtly sporty attitude. The design alterations in the León Pies 
        Descalzos include the exterior colour, which is a unique lilac metallic. 
        This colour can also be found on several details in the interior such as 
        the dashboard and the back of the seats. Furthermore, the standard 
        18-inch wheels are painted black. The standard SEAT León Cupra was 
        transformed to a totally unique car that one lucky person will win in 
        the draw at the end of the fundraising campaign on May15. Its winner 
        will be announced during the Barcelona Motor Show, beginning of June.

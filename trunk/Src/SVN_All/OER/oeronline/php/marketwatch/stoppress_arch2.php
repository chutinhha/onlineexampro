                        Supervisor of the Finance Ministry, who delivered a

                        its debate on the draft development plan. Macki said the 
                        Seventh FYP accorded priority to maintaining the current 
                        level of the average of actual individual income. Thus, 
                        it targeted growth of the national economy by no less

                        population increase during the plan period. He added the 
                        plan came in continuation of the comprehensive 
                        development policy. The initial projections indicated 
                        that the GDP (on current prices) would grow by three per

                        than five per cent during the plan period. The plan’s 
                        financial framework was based on achieving sustainable 
                        levels of expenditure by rationalising it, enhancing 
                        financial reserves by transferring part of the General

                        fresh move to bring more services to the Internet in a 
                        bid to fend off challenges from rivals like Google and 
                        Yahoo that could chip away at the customer base of the 
                        world’s biggest software firm. Microsoft recently 
                        unveiled a strategy for Web services based on its 
                        flagship Windows and Office products. The company will 
                        offer “Office Live” to help small and mid-size 
                        businesses use and maintain the suite of software used 
                        for applications such as e-mail, scheduling, 
                        Spreadsheets and Word Processing. Carmi Levy of the 
                        research firm Info-Tech said Microsoft’s announcement 
                        means “the end of shrink-wrapped software in a box and 
                        the start of the Internet-based services era. It marks a 
                        turning point in the industry.”</font></p>

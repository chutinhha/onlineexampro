            seems to be no end to the run up in the MSM Index in 2005. The Index 
            has already gained around 40 per cent in the first four months 
            itself as against just 30 per cent on an annualised basis, since the 
            Bull Run started from the beginning of 2002. <br>
            <br>
            <b>NBO – the hero for the month</b><br>
            The MSM further rallied by another 2.6 per cent during the month 
            ending May 22, 2005, with the gains largely from the banking sector. 
            In fact, National Bank of Oman could be aptly called the hero for 
            the month as it fluctuated around on huge volumes during the period 
            under review, before hitting the upper end of the circuit breaker 
            twice in the same trading session after the MSM authorities relaxed 
            their rules for the NBO stock. The news that contributed for this 
            sudden jump was the announcement by Commercial Bank of Qatar to take 
            a stake in the bank at a whopping RO4.450 per share. This was 
            against the ruling share price of RO3.500 during that time. Overall, 
            the stock price gained by almost 16 per cent during the period under 
            review to close at RO4.230. <br>
            <br>
            This positive effect percolated down to all the stocks in the 
            different sector as the market suddenly flared from the narrow 
            trading zone of 4550-4650 levels to sail past the 4700-levels with 
            ease. This included both indexed and the non-indexed stocks. 
            However, many stocks went up as the valuations again became 
            attractive on post-dividend scenario. Amongst the indices included 
            Oman Chlorine, Dhofar Cattlefeed, Renaissance Services, Oman Oil 
            Marketing et al while amongst the non-indices included companies 
            like Gulf International Chemicals, National Securities, Al Anwar 
            Holding, Hilton Salalah et al.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Dhofar Power was 
            another stock that was eagerly awaited and saw huge volumes after it 
            got listed on May 8, 2005. With the offer price at RO1.420, the 
            price improved to touch a peak of RO1.900 before closing the period 
            with a 340 baiza gain. Other stocks that shared the limelight 
            included the pre-merger price movements of Renaissance &amp; TEAM. Both 
            of these stocks also witnessed huge volumes amongst their share 
            price fluctuations. TEAM prices rose from RO2.330 to reach a peak of 
            RO2.450 before closing sharply downward to RO2.240, after getting 
            ex-dividend in the process by 100 baiza. Renaissance Services also 
            mapped the same moves as that of TEAM initially before ending 
            strongly even after getting ex-dividend on both cash as well as 
            stock dividend by more than 650 baiza on previous month closing to 
            around the RO9-mark.<br>
            <br>
            The total volumes during the period under review were RO94.9 
            million, which works out to a very good average of RO4.32 million. 
            However, the extent to which NBO and Dhofar Power constituted can be 
            gauged from their figures itself. NBO clocked volumes of more than 
            RO13 million while Dhofar Power clocked in around RO6 million, with 
            both constituting around 20 per cent of the total value traded 
            during the period. While Renaissance and TEAM both constituted close 
            to RO7.8 million to get a share of around 8 per cent of the total 
            market value. <br>
            <br>
            <b>The outlook</b><br>
            The market has fetched abnormal returns in the first four months of 
            2005, and has come very close to its all-time high of 5000-levels, 
            reached way back in 1998. However, the bull run of 1997-98 was 
            different from the current rally because the market at that time was 
            driven by leveraged capital as a result of the margin and trust 
            accounts. This has, however, changed over the last few years, with 
            margin and trust accounts no longer existing. The only leveraged 
            capital existing in the current market is in the form of bank 
            lending, which is also regulated as per the Central Bank of Oman 
            (CBO) norms. Hence, the current market growth appears to be 
            originated from a real source of investible surplus in the market 
            and not buoyed by leveraged funding.<br>
            <br>
            The last few days of the period under review showed that the market 
            could gain a step further and could reach the 5000-mark. The reason 
            for this is not far to seek. If one looks at the last couple of 
            months’ performance amongst the GCC indices, there has been a sharp 
            drop in Bahrain and Qatar markets, both in the process losing by 29 
            per cent and 20.4 per cent respectively. We believe that unlike its 
            regional counterparts, Oman has understated the price of oil prices 
            significantly in the current budget. Hence, the average oil price 
            which ruled at around $42.5/barrel for the first four months of the 
            year is expected to be maintained and average out at around at least 
            at $35+/barrel in the current year. This would indirectly improve 
            the oil revenues on the same production base by more than 50 per 
            cent. <br>
            <br>
            Hence, given the relatively lower valuations and the expectations 
            that the returns from the Omantel issue would not be significant 
            given the lock-in period for the Omantel issue for GCC investors 
            being kept at around 3 months, the secondary market could again 
            become buoyant. Hence investors are advised to maintain their 
            holdings in the short term but remain cautious when making any fresh 
            purchases.</font></p>

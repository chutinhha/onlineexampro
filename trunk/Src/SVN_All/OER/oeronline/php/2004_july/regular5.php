            <br>
            <br>
            <b>By Robert Cooper and Ayman Sawaf </b><br>
            (Paperback) 358pp <br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            Studies have shown that the most intelligent people are often not 
            that successful in their personal lives. As authors Cooper and Sawaf 
            demonstrate, this principle applies in business as well. The authors 
            argue that business accomplishment depends on &quot;emotional 
            intelligence&quot; - an attribute that &quot;enables you to be authentic and 
            true to your best self; to be clear and get along... and to sense 
            opportunities and create the future.&quot; This book is a welcoming 
            variation from other traditional books on motivation or success, in 
            that it lays the groundwork for being sincerely emotionally 
            intelligent as a basis for success rather than a 'how-to' technical 
            book on acting in a business situation. It is an interesting read 
            which summarises research on Emotional Intelligence, why it is 
            important, includes tools to measure EQ with a handy 'EQ test' and 
            apply it to everyday circumstances.<br>
            <br>
            To quote the definition in the book, &quot;Emotional Intelligence is the 
            ability to sense, understand and effectively apply the power and 
            acumen of emotions as a source of human energy, information and 
            influence.&quot; Cooper and Sawaf's book is an original effort to allow 
            our understanding of emotional intelligence to achieve high levels 
            in practical applications/workplace. 
            Executive EQ did address many questions about the <b>
            <img border="0" src="book2.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" width="89" height="110"></b>application of EI 
            in business and integrated it with rational anecdotes leaving me 
            with deeper insights into the practices of leaders using intuition 
            in decision-making. <br>
            <br>
            Overall, I am impressed with this book. It clearly indicates what is 
            wrong with the work culture of today. I would recommend this book as 
            one of the best use of time and money for business executives today.

            All parents are concerned about how their child will turn out to be 
            and work hard to ensure that the child is the best in every aspect 
            at different stages of his/her life. Sometimes, we parents overdo 
            things and force our children to be what we want them to be rather 
            than building on what the best that they have and can do. We tend to 
            forget about the child's own identity, and don't realise that the 
            loss of a child's identity can destroy his/her self esteem in the 
            long run. We create the image of the child from fantasy, to an 
            extent that our children sometimes regard us as 'pushy' parents. <br>
            <br>
            We all want to have a smart, genius, active, well-mannered child 
            with a strong personality. However, there is no a specific or 
            perfect formula in order to construct such a child. What we as 
            parents can do is to learn from real-life stories and examples and 
            try to put that into practice in our own way without causing any 
            negative effect on the child. <br>
            <br>
            One book that illustrates such examples and which I would like to 
            recommend to every parent is Rich Kid Smart Kid. The authors have 
            made a mind-awakening tome. It offers guidelines and you may 
            consider it or call it a reference book to better parenting. The 
            writer talks about the real life experiences based on his own life 
            and that of his closest encounters. The guidelines are very 
            practical to apply in one's day-to-day real-life situations. It 
            makes you wonder about your own skills in bringing up your child.
            <br>
            <br>
            This book is suitable for all parents - both new parents needing to 
            know the best guidelines to raising a child as well as for parents 
            with older children who need to bring the best out of them. I would 
            like to recommend this book to all the parents and the same may be 
            used as a day-to-day reference guide to a better parenting.

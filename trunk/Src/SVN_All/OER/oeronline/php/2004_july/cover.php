            What role do our most important business leaders play today?&nbsp; 
            How do the CEOs of major corporations construe their&nbsp; jobs in 
            this time of extraordinary and rapid change? Vicky Kapur maps the 
            mind of&nbsp; a CEO and finds out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what the 
            country's head-honchos do to rejuvenate their mind and soul when

            with running his corporation 'successfully'? Maybe not. Do the 
            country's chief executives, or, for that matter, the chairmen, 
            managing directors and even group general managers--those at the 
            helm of affairs of corporate Oman--believe so? Or have they lulled 
            themselves into a false sense of well-being by convincing themselves 
            that they're doing a great service to all by running their 
            corporations with clinical precision, not making time for 'larger 
            issues'? <br>
            <br>
            Our quest to unfurl what goes on inside the mind of a CEO and what a 
            powerful corporate executive should stand for, took us to the 
            doorsteps of the leaders of a cross-section of business 
            organisations in Oman. The one overwhelming learning that we 
            acquired was that rapid changes in the business environment are 
            having a profound impact on the man at the top of the organisational 
            hierarchy, and making the jobs of such business barons extremely 
            excruciating. <br>
            <br>
            There is not only a huge change in the roles that a business leader 
            is expected to play today, it has also complicated the challenges 
            that CEOs face by making them more varied and diverse than ever. <br>
            <br>
            The CEOs have their hands full with the central strategic problems 
            of how to make their organisations grow beyond the scope of the 
            ordinary, taking advantage of the Internet and the global economy. 
            Secondly, they face certain everyday dilemmas of leading and 
            managing corporate Goliaths. And to top it, they have roles to play 
            on the local, regional and global socio-economic stage. </font></p>

            <b>Power CEOs wield </b><br>
            <img border="0" src="cover4.jpg" align="left" width="130" height="250">Given 
            the changing nature of business, CEOs need to devote time and energy 
            to social, political and economic causes since they can influence 
            society and spearhead changes. Are CEOs in Oman actually doing that? 
            Fundamentally, how do corporate head-honchos in Oman construe the 
            job of a business leader in this time of extraordinary and rapid 
            change? &quot;Businesses both influence the society as well as are 
            influenced by the society. It is important that the business leader 
            understands these two aspects and the extent to which his/her 
            individual corporate entity relates to the society,'' answers Irshad 
            Lawati, managing director, Shell Oman Marketing Company (SOMC), the 
            Sultanate's largest public listed company. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;In Shell Oman, we strongly believe in both the aspects and pay a 
            lot of attention to the impact of our activities on the society as 
            well as the role that we as corporate citizens should play in the 
            society. We approach it under the broad context of our 'Sustainable 
            Development' strategy which postulates a proactive role to be played 
            in managing the relationship in a way that leads to optimisation of 
            positive impact on our surroundings,'' he claims. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Business leaders should set an example. The higher the profile you 
            have, the higher the responsibility you have to reflect that back on 
            society,'' agrees Colin Hobbs, chief executive, Oman Airports 
            Management Company (OAMC). <br>
            <br>
            &quot;I think anybody who is high profiled--be it a pop star or a 
            business leader or a politician--has an enormous responsibility to 
            set a good example for those around,'' he adds. &quot;Business leaders 
            should LEAD; lead by example and do so decisively and intensely. The 
            world is full of decent, good, qualified managers. There is, 
            however, in my opinion a shortfall of strong, focused, resourceful 
            leadership,'' maintains John Carlough, chief executive officer of 
            Oman International Bank (OIB). </font></td>

                              professional services organisation, conducted its 
                              sixth annual global CEO survey of 1,000 CEOs from 
                              43 countries and published the results in early 
                              2004. The CEOs were asked to step back from their 
                              daily challenges and to provide their thoughts, 
                              their hopes and fears, and their insights into how 
                              to lead through these uncertain times. They were 
                              asked to share their strategies and tactics for

                              ahead, what are the prospects for real growth in 
                              the post-Internet bubble, post-Enron economy? What 
                              are the tools and strategies CEOs can use to 
                              create and sustain real value? What can CEOs do to 
                              increase investor confidence? And beyond a focus 
                              on earnings and earnings alone, what are the 
                              responsibilities of corporate leaders to their 
                              communities and constituents and to global 
                              society? PwC revealed that the results of the

            Enterprises (MSE), takes the argument even further by suggesting 
            that countries like Oman have to run like corporations, very much on 
            the lines of Dubai and Singapore. &quot;Oman can learn from the 
            experience of senior management leaders on how to institutionalise 
            processes so that the inefficiency and wastage in the system is 
            weeded out or reduced, productivity is enhanced and, most 
            importantly, when you see yourself a party to building a society, 
            you will do much more than what you are currently doing. We should 
            look at ways to involve the country's business leaders in the 
            nation-building debate.'' On the other hand, Ajay M. Khimji, 
            partner, Khimji Ramdas (KR), would want business leaders to &quot;work 
            together typically in a family-oriented manner.'' <br>
            <br>
            We all know that Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Michael Dell, John 
            Chambers, Jeff Bezos, Steve Case and Meg Whitman participate in some 
            form of philanthropy - whether it is setting up foundations, 
            participating with groups, or merely signing a cheque from time to 
            time. However, a CEO who is active philanthropically may set an 
            example to employees. &quot;Businesspeople should draw attention to those 
            who are less well-off. There is enormous amount of good work being 
            done--charities, day-to-day philanthropy, donations etc.--which 
            never get seen because it isn't fashionable. But it is fashionable 
            to drive around in a great expensive car, is it? I am a bit nervous 
            about this constant attitude of win at any cost,'' cautions Hobbs.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the past few years, CEOs of some of the largest companies in the 
            US have taken on a celebrity status. Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, 
            Carly Fiorina and Jack Welch have become icons and role models in 
            much the same way as Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones. 
            Their images are carefully crafted in the media and their public 
            statements are designed to project leadership and global values. 
            Perceptions do matter and senior management needs to embody and 
            expand a company's values and vision in a way that is compelling to 
            investors. In consequence, CEO reputation should be actively managed 
            as a corporate asset consistent with company philosophy. <br>
            <br>
            Times are tough for CEOs and successful executives must do more than 
            simply demonstrate integrity. Today's leaders need to serve as 
            positive role models for their employees - blending a strong moral 
            compass with the flexibility to adapt to new circumstances. In many 
            ways, the CEO is the guardian of corporate reputation. While the age 
            of the celebrity CEO may only recently be reaching the region, 
            clearly, the impact of the CEO on a company's reputation is still 
            very important. This has always been true in times of corporate 
            crises. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Changes CEOs cope with </b><br>
            In many ways, 2001 was a watershed year for company management 
            worldwide. The bursting of dotcom exuberance coupled with global 
            economic recession not only saw the collapse of untenable business 
            models, it brought into sharp relief far wider issues of business 
            accountability, financial valuations, corporate governance and the 
            level of trust that is given to CEOs. The rapid collapse of Enron, 
            formerly one of America's 'Most Admired' companies and the knock-on 
            impact to Arthur Andersen and the accounting industry are an 
            indication of what happens when that trust is lost. <br>
            <br>
            Locally too, repercussions of the global events left corporates 
            struggling, striving as they were to replicate the elusive growth 
            models of the 1990s. Events of 9/11 and the resulting crisis of 
            confidence that rippled across the globe combined with the economic 
            difficulties in the region to create widespread anxiety. The war in 
            Iraq and the ensuing political uncertainty have had a negative 
            impact on the investments in the region, in particular, and on 
            business in general. Dealing with all this and more, perhaps, is 
            part and parcel of being a business leader. <br>
            <br>
            As SOMC's Lawati puts it: &quot;I strongly believe that 'change = life', 
            and that 'if you stop changing, you stop living'. In general, 
            organisational success depends on effective responses to changes in 
            the environment and adaptation to those. However, a better position 
            to be in would be to 'intelligently' pre-empt changes and plan and 
            implement responses in advance; and yet, a further advantageous 
            position would be to 'create' changes that others then have to 
            follow.'' <br>
            <br>
            Agrees MSE's Saher: &quot;I believe the changes taking place outside are 
            extraordinarily rapid. One of the areas in which changes are 
            happening is in the way the customer is doing his business and, 
            therefore, the way he expects us to deliver. Customer expectation is 
            going through a dramatic change and I believe that I need to 
            constantly keep an eye on that. I need to be sensitive about the 
            trends outside - internationally, regionally as well as in the 
            country. As a CEO, I must be able to spot a trend early enough so 
            that we are not in a state of un-preparedness when it actually hits 
            us. I also keep on looking at what world-class companies are doing 
            in terms of their processes and dealing with each other to be able 
            to emulate some of their best practices and benchmark against the 
            best.'' <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Intense change has been a large part of the financial Institutions 
            environment around the world for some time now; so, I am quite used 
            to living in an environment of change. I prefer it in fact. It 
            challenges me and the team to think creatively, to be resourceful 
            and responsive to look for new solutions to old problems,'' 
            maintains OIB's Carlough. CEOs must assume the challenging tasks of 
            anticipating and preparing for critical events as well as crafting 
            strategies for their companies to prosper amidst different 
            scenarios. <br>
            <br>
            No one, however, could have anticipated the confluence of critical 
            events that dominated 2002--ongoing terrorist attacks on multiple 
            continents, the protracted world economic downturn, and an 
            unprecedented crisis in corporate governance--yet, it remains the 
            role of the CEO to prepare for, and to lead through, these and other 
            challenges. Carlough, for one, enjoys continuous change and, in 
            fact, suggests that he thrives in the process. &quot;I believe my success 
            in the past has been based on my ability to create change in the 
            workplace, not for the sake of change, but for continued 
            organisational improvement. So, for me, these times of extraordinary 
            change are a part of my normal work day. I wouldn't want it any 
            other way.'' <br>
            <br>
            MSE's Saher defines his role as someone who has to find ways and 
            means to enhance the performance of the organisation and ensure that 
            it succeeds. KR's Khimji, on the other hand, has a simple yet 
            effective philosophy about his role as a business leader. &quot;I take 
            each day as it comes. In businesses, there are lots of ups and 
            downs, but I try to handle things in a peaceful manner, especially 
            while dealing with problems.'' <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="oamc.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="175" height="203">&quot;Internally, in the context of what I sense happening externally, my 
            prime job is to set a direction and strategy that fits into the 
            strengths and the core competencies of the organisation on the one 
            hand and the customer's expectations on the other - something that 
            can create a distinctive value proposition in the mind of a 
            customer. Supporting strategies would be to make sure that there is 
            an alignment between our people, processes and technologies. When 
            that alignment is perfect, productivity is really high. When that 
            alignment is not right, something or the other does not happen in 
            spite of the good intentions. Finally, I ensure that within the 
            organisation, we have a holistic system which works as a 
            well-grooved mechanism,'' believes Saher. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;It is not only the extent of change that a corporate leader has to 
            deal with, but also the pace at which newer situations pose 
            themselves as hurdles to pass. The key challenge for a corporate 
            leader is thus to comprehend the change, devise response and manage 
            the change process. Hence, my job involves a constant monitoring of 
            strategic changes in the environment - both macro and micro - to 
            ensure our positioning is appropriate, and to timely and 
            appropriately trigger required response,'' sums up Lawati. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Challenges CEOs face </b><br>
            The rules for operating a business in this 'Age of Uncertainty' have 
            changed and the pressures on CEOs to manage effectively have 
            intensified. Managing confidence, be it of investors, employees, 
            customers or other stakeholders, is key to the survival of both the 
            business and the chief executive. &quot;One of the biggest challenges in 
            the region is the prevailing uncertainty due to the politics of the 
            region. If we were just blessed with a bit of stability and lack of 
            terrorism, it would materially affect how our airport develops,'' 
            believes OAMC's Hobbs. <br>
            <br>
            The biggest challenge facing corporates in the country today, 
            according to MSE's Saher, is how to grow in a flat environment. 
            &quot;Every organisation, to remain profitable, has to grow. And growth 
            in normal times necessarily comes from growth in the environment in 
            which you are operating. But if the environment is not growing at a 
            substantial rate, then how do you grow? Do you just extend your 
            portfolio so that you are now doing things which you weren't earlier 
            doing, or do you look at new markets in which to operate?'' he asks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Agrees SOMC's Lawati: &quot;In the context of change in Oman at the macro 
            level, I would think the common challenges would be the longer-term 
            economic scene, sustainable growth and the need to cope with the 
            changes in the socio-economic environment. There would naturally be 
            scores of other aspects of challenge, which would vary from one 
            industry to another and one entity to another.'' So also believes 
            OIB's Carlough. &quot;There are a number of interesting challenges 
            today,'' he claims. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The team's first challenge is the limited opportunities in the 
            market. The market is also competitive, so my team has to be 
            creative, quick to respond and willing to go the extra mile. 
            Customers are certainly getting more price-sensitive, therefore, 
            there are new challenges to face and creative solutions to be 
            determined for asset and liability management in order to be able to 
            price product and services competitively in an effort to lead the 
            market,'' he enlists. <br>
            <br>
            Price-sensitivity is something about which MSE's Saher is concerned 
            too. &quot;When there are too many players in a market that isn't growing 
            very fast, there is an obvious pressure on price. So, maintaining 
            your gross margins and providing customers a value proposition so as 
            to maintain your bottomline is another challenge.'' KR's Khimji is 
            in agreement with the thought, proclaiming that &quot;growth and having 
            the best people in the right job are two of the biggest challenges 
            facing the country today.'' <br>
            <br>
            OIB's Carlough also believes that HR management has become a much 
            larger challenge in recent times. &quot;Middle managers are more mobile 
            today, shifting to a new organisation if they are not being 
            challenged, rewarded and compensated properly. This is compounded by 
            the lack of replacement resources available in the marketplace,'' he 
            says. As most products and services can be replicated today, the key 
            business differentiator is human capital. Agrees Saher: &quot;Attracting 
            the right people and giving them the career they're looking for in 
            order to reward and retain them to gain an edge over competition is 
            a challenge.'' <br>
            <br>
            That, as Saher himself acknowledges, is easier said than done. 
            &quot;Short-term profits and returns on investments many at times become 
            the end, and people are confused on whether to follow the process in 
            terms of customer satisfaction and handling of customers or should 
            they treat them as luxuries and hence ignore them in favour of 
            getting the job done and getting the numbers. It's a challenge 
            between the short and the long term. As an organisation, we have to 
            keep on building in a manner where the long term is as, if not more, 
            secure as the short term. For that, you have to keep on doing the 
            right things in terms of strategy and processes,'' he advocates. <br>
            <br>
            Lawati suggests working with the changes and the opportunities they 
            throw up rather than against them to overcome the challenges they 
            pose. &quot;The government has been playing a very important role in 
            nurturing the macro aspects of the socio-economic texture in the 
            country for the past three-and-a-half decades. The recent advent of 
            'privatisation' is now opening the floor for the private sector to 
            take a direct role, side by side with the government. This will 
            require a very high sense of responsibility on part of the corporate 
            sector, and it would be a mistake to expect easy and fast solutions. 
            Close work with the authorities will help the development of the apt 
            trade and socio-economic policies that will enable us to overcome 
            the challenges,'' he maintains. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Roles CEOs Play </b><br>
            Today's businesses and corporate environment are not limited to 
            business complexes and industrial estates. Corporate leaders in this 
            age and time have a much larger responsibility than plain and simple 
            profit-making, which extends to not only being a good corporate 
            citizen, but also participating in the socio-economic development of 
            the country. With that as an objective, clearly, corporate leaders 
            have to wear many hats in the present day scenario and the roles 
            that they play are myriad and complex. A CEO has to be directive and 
            participative, teacher and student, challenging and accepting, 
            leader and follower - all at the same time. Put simply, there's no 
            one-size-fits-all solution for the CEO - no single leadership style 
            works on all occasions. CEOs need to experiment with a wide variety 
            of styles and be open to learn from experience. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;I think of a CEO's role very much in terms of a conductor of an 
            orchestra. His job is to ensure that the total piece of music that 
            the audience hears is as good as they expected to hear. Now that 
            starts off right from deciding what piece of music should be played 
            - i.e., in OAMC's case, what shape do we want the airport to look 
            like in 5 years' time, to the strategy of getting new business, how 
            we are placed in terms of safety of operations, and what systems and 
            equipment do we need in order for us to get to our primary two 
            objectives - firstly, a safe and secure operations, and secondly, 
            something that will delight the customer,'' suggests Hobbs. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Then, we assemble the team and we let them know what exactly is 
            expected of them - what piece of music we want played. We don't send 
            them away to do their own thing - to learn their violin part or the 
            trumpet part or whatever. And we monitor what they are doing by 
            visiting each area. Then we bring them all together - we have to 
            bring them all together 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whereas a 
            piece of music is played just once,'' he adds. <br>
            <br>
            That, in a nutshell, is how a business leader is expected to perform 
            - not only to keep the complete picture in mind at all times, but 
            also ensure that the executives--frontline or those at the backend 
            of operations--know how important their pieces are in the overall 
            completion of that picture. &quot;I generally see myself as wanting to 
            look at the complete picture, the complications within it, then 
            ultimately try and simplify it - first in my mind in terms of how I 
            read those signals, and then communicate it to the company in a 
            simple manner. We are an organisation of 400 people, and different 
            trends, signals mean different thing to different people. If you 
            create a very complicated verbal scenario, then everyone will not 
            understand what we are saying. So, to bring it down to a single 
            simple shared business objective and philosophy is how I see my 
            job,'' explains Saher. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;In an airport, we have a vast number of customers who actually can 
            have more impact on the passenger than we do. If the check-in queues 
            are long, it is the individual airlines who check passengers. It's 
            us that have to try and motivate all those other customers so that 
            the whole team gives the passenger a seamless service. That is where 
            my skills of persuasion, discussion and negotiation come handy in 
            making them understand that we're all going to get more business if 
            we provide a safer and a more professional operation. Now there 
            always are disputes and there are successes. My job is to accentuate 
            the successes and resolve the disputes as easily as possible. Like 
            that piece of orchestra, if one of the first violins is playing a 
            bum note, then you go and help him,'' describes Hobbs. <br>
            <br>
            As Lawati puts it: &quot;I look at myself as two 'personalities' (at 
            least): one, in the corporate executive position in question, and 
            two, the human being with own, family and other social commitments 
            and roles. Each of these two roles has different requirements, 
            probably changing also in different ways, and I might differ with 
            those wishing to look at both in an integrated fashion. Such an 
            approach would stipulate that changing roles in the corporate life 
            of a person should get reflected on his private life - and I 
            certainly do not subscribe to this school. Hence, this kicks the 
            matter off on a rather complex platform of 'duality'.'' </font></p>

            <b>Accountability CEOs have</b> <br>
            Even a decade ago, it was an easier time to be CEO or chairman. The 
            management model was largely based on command and control. Top 
            management was largely free from accountability, save to 
            shareholders and sometimes governments, and the chief executive's 
            fame was limited to his peers, his clubs and to shareholders. <br>
            <br>
            This traditional management model, while long dead in the US and 
            becoming extinct in Europe, is still alive in the Middle East and 
            many parts of Asia. Change is coming, however, in part through 
            internal generational change with new leaders assuming control of 
            family-controlled businesses and introducing new management 
            techniques or going to the markets in search of capital, and in part 
            through external changes brought about by new corporate governance 
            regulations and the demand from shareholders for greater 
            accountability. <br>
            <br>
            Another challenge that business houses face today includes setting a 
            high level of a moral and ethical code within the whole system. 
            &quot;Corporate governance implementation, monitoring of compliance, 
            improving the general understanding of the concepts and building 
            acceptance amongst the management team across corporate Oman has to 
            be one of the biggest challenges facing the country today,'' 
            maintains Carlough. &quot;Countries like Singapore have shown to the 
            world that you can be committed to certain set of core values in the 
            nation-building activity. Business leaders and houses have a 
            difficult role to play to set that norm,'' propounds Saher. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;There has to be a mechanism in place through which commitment to 
            certain value systems has to be ingrained. Wipro and Infosys of 
            India are two companies that have reached a turnover of a billion 
            dollars and are at the same time committed to a certain value system 
            - here's proof that it's a myth to believe that if you are committed 
            to a value system, then progress is retarded,'' he adds. In fact, 
            Saher believes that if such a business environment progresses in 
            Oman, we will be able to attract the right kind of multinationals 
            and thus will be able to attract foreign investment and the right 
            kind of talent, and the system will flourish over a period of 
            time.'' </font></td>

            </table>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">This is, again, easier said than done. Agrees Hobbs: &quot;Business is 
            all about making a profit and giving a service. However, at times, 
            there tends to be a little bit too much of the 'making profits' part 
            of it.'' Counters Saher: &quot;All you need to achieve that objective is 
            someone to step outside the crowd and say that I will follow the 
            value system, certain right ways of doing things, not taking 
            short-cuts, not indulging in practices that are not right... In 
            fact, you need many such business leaders to start believing in it. 
            This is a big challenge anywhere in the world today, and should be 
            built into the national strategies - whether into the curriculum in 
            the schools or the code of ethics of private and government 
            organisations... Someone has to bell the cat. If people are talking 
            in terms of setting visions and missions and going after creation of 
            excellent world-class companies, these things are equally 
            important.'' <br>

            <img border="0" src="john.jpg" align="right" width="156" height="201" hspace="6"><b>Decisions CEOs take</b> <br>
            The role of the CEO may have become a lot 
            more challenging, but it is no way any less interesting than what it 
            was earlier. In the face of turbulent times where speed and 
            flexibility are essential, CEOs need to be ambidextrous. Personal 
            characteristics often play an important role in the unpredictable 
            career trajectories of a CEO. A typical day in office for a CEO is 
            extremely unpredictable, and that's one of the great attractions of 
            the job, according to Hobbs. <br>
            <br>
            One moment the CEO could be looking at taking existential decisions 
            like entering a new market or introducing a product line, and he 
            could well be spending the next hour trying to explain to the 
            support staff the importance of maintaining hygiene in the 
            workplace. &quot;You will no doubt be surprised to know there is a large 
            disparity in the complexity of the decisions that my office is 
            confronted with on a dally basis. For example, in any one day I 
            could be addressing a strategic decision, to considering 
            participation of a regional syndication and its effects on our 
            mismatch to dealing with a staff request that is an exception to 
            policy, to responding to a regulatory issue. There are strategic 
            issues to be addressed every single day. This variety and change in 
            complexity is what makes this job so fulfilling, and continues to 
            challenge my flexibility, decision-making skills and the management 
            of my time,'' confides Carlough. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Quite often, you have six meetings in a day - you have regular 
            meetings to keep the team motivated and going in the right 
            direction; you have some meetings that are about new innovations; 
            some meetings about long-term strategy; lots of coordination with 
            our airlines, D-G Cam, the police, immigration etc.,'' echoes Hobbs. 
            Saher, on the other hand, tries to restrict himself to taking 
            strategic, non-operational kinds of decisions. &quot;Mainly, my decisions 
            are strategic in nature, concerning the direction, the strategy, the 
            resources, decisions on new business (go/no-go) and the structuring 
            of the organisation. We have delegated fair amount of authority to 
            the general managers of the various divisions of our company. So, 
            the decisions that I take end up being more strategic. <br>
            <br>
            However, he too doesn't enjoy the luxury of not taking routine 
            operational decisions when the need arises. &quot;I also do get involved 
            operationally when we have to take a decision which is an exception 
            to the set authorities. We do have policies on most things, 
            including a very well-documented personnel policy, but life is such 
            that there seem to be too many exceptions. When people want to come 
            up with an exceptional request, it invariably gets escalated because 
            it becomes a policy issue and one has to take a stand. That's 
            another area where I take decisions,'' he admits. <br>
            <br>
            Lawati, however, manages to the art of deft delegation to the T, and 
            gets involved mainly &quot;in top level decision-making on 
            policy/procedural matters, business strategy direction, business 
            performance appraisals, investment proposals, corporate matters and 
            a host of other non-routine business aspects.'' In SOMC, he claims, 
            &quot;we have a very clearly defined authority structure that enables our 
            managers to make business decisions (up to defined limits) without 
            necessarily referring all matters to the top management; an 
            effective delegation process that provides authority to the people 
            of the organisation in the right manner and makes them responsible 
            is key to a successful organisation. This helps the smooth running 
            of the organisational process in an efficient and controlled 
            manner,'' he adds. <br>
            <br>
            One of the skills of being a CEO is trying to put energy--but not 
            too much--into things that matter. &quot;You don't interfere with the 
            professionals in their job,'' maintains Hobbs, &quot;but I try and make 
            sure that they have enough steering, enough guidance so that they 
            know where they are going, and if they have a crisis, I pitch in and 
            help them just for 10 minutes or an hour or a day or whatever it 
            might need, and then I back off again. It's a tight-rope all day 
            long.'' Khimji too keeps himself busy with taking strategic 
            decisions about how sales can be improved or how to reach out to 
            more countries, increase brand awareness, and enhance the product in 
            the best possible way. &quot;There are always value-additions that can be 
            made, to bring in variety or to ensure that the product is 
            well-accepted in the various markets that it is exported to,'' he 
            suggests. <br>
            <br>
            Taking further his analogy of the CEO as the conductor of an 
            orchestra, Hobbs explains that &quot;like the conductor of the music, he 
            has to sense which bits are coming to the fore at any one time and 
            ensure that they are in harmony with the rest of the notes. It might 
            be, for instance, maintenance--we may have a problem with 
            toilets--so, I need to put my time into maintenance. It may be 
            safety issues--we may have rubber that needs to be taken off the 
            runway--so I put my attention on to that. So, from day-to-day, I 
            will have different things that come to the top of my list that are 
            priorities that I must attend to first of all.'' <br>
            <br>
            The other part of the CEO's role is, of course, long-term. It's a 
            combination of determining strategy and knowing where you are going 
            in the future and letting the entire team know that. Above all, it 
            includes building the motivation of targeting the common knowledge 
            of where everybody is heading so that the entire team pulls in the 
            same direction. Whatever the end objective might be, the change 
            constant ensures that the role of our business leaders continues to 
            be demanding as well as interesting at the same time. As Hobbs sums 
            it up: &quot;Things happen quite often. Harold Macmillan, former PM of 
            Britain, was asked what was the single greatest influence on his 
            success as a prime minister - 'Events, dear boy, events.' In other 
            words, you never know what's going to come out and how you are going 
            to handle it. That makes the job interesting.'' <br>
            <br>
            <b>Things CEOs do</b> <br>
            There is no 'typical day' in the life of a CEO 
            - which is probably what makes his job all the more compelling. As 
            mentioned earlier, the role of a CEO is such that it demands the 
            individual to be different things to different people at different 
            times in different scenarios. For a CEO, there is no way to explain 
            accurately and succinctly just what it is that he strives to 
            accomplish on a daily basis except for, perhaps, continuous 
            organisational improvement. <br>
            <br>
            Articulates Saher: &quot;We are so diverse that a typical day involves 
            completely different activities - I could be dealing with the 
            marketing strategy in the morning, the next hour I could be spending 
            on an HRD related issue, the next hour I could be spending on a new 
            project that we are setting up, then I may be looking into statutory 
            issues concerning accounts and audit report - tax planning. The 
            biggest challenge--one I enjoy too--is the diversity of my job and 
            the versatility that I have to bring to play to be able to 
            completely unrelated issues.'' <br>
            <br>
            Carlough's day starts with a brief overview of the local newspaper 
            to keep abreast of the local and regional events, market changes and 
            business opportunities. &quot;Of course, I follow the share prices - the 
            banking sector in particular,'' he says. &quot;Throughout the week, I 
            have scheduled morning meetings with different direct reports to 
            discuss results, target to plan variances, and a detailed list of 
            their pending business issues,'' he reveals. &quot;On a monthly basis, we 
            review their accomplishments against planned Management by 
            Objectives (MBOs) for the month, and discuss any shortfalls and look 
            for fixes. Nearly every day there is a customer or vendor visitor,'' 
            he adds. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;There is a tremendous volume of reading material that comes across 
            my desk everyday such as reports, requests of action, strategic 
            documents and approval documents. This activity demands a large 
            percentage of my day and requires timely response from my office in 
            order to maintain continued improvement of the organisation,'' he 
            adds. Carlough also attempts to make time to visit some department 
            of the head office to interact with the support staff there on a 
            daily basis. &quot;While not daily, I do spend a fair amount of my time 
            in the field, visiting branches, a part of my job that I thoroughly 
            enjoy and find most helpful when planning future strategies.'' <br>
            <br>
            A major part of Khimji's day, too, is occupied by &quot;meetings, 
            inspections, and being with the sales force.'' On a similar note, 
            Saher tries to rally the team around a common cause through regular 
            meetings. &quot;My style is one of discussion and debate. So, we do have 
            a lot of meetings. My typical day would include four or five 
            meetings, two or three external, and the rest internal. All our 
            systems are completely wired, so I do get what I call a top view in 
            terms of the MIS. I make it a point to keep an eye on the 
            consolidated figures that emerge. I also spend half-an-hour to an 
            hour with my chairman and directors to discuss issues that they'd 
            like to seek my ideas/opinions on.'' <br>
            <br>
            His endeavour, though, is to have 15 to 20 minutes a day to himself 
            when he is actually not doing anything, but reflecting on various 
            issues. &quot;Unfortunately, I am not able to do that on most days as, 
            more often than not, the urgent takes over the important,'' he 
            laments. <br>
            <br>
            Lawati's typical day in office entails &quot;engagements with people 
            (staff/visitors), tackling my ever growing email inbox, dealing with 
            paperwork, review of various data, reading daily papers, and time 
            for brief reflection before I make major decisions. Once or twice a 
            week, there would be an outside office task to attend a meeting, 
            participate in a function or a late evening party.'' <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="mse1.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" width="150" height="198"><b>Games CEOs play</b>
            <br>
            So we all agree that from boardroom boredom 
            to jetlag jitters to stock market shocks, the country's business 
            barons lead a high-strung life. How, then, do they rejuvenate their 
            body and soul? How do they ensure that, after a hectic day's 
            work--meetings, inspections, strategic decisions etc. etc.--they are 
            ready for the grind the next day? The job of a CEO/leader is very 
            demanding and stressful. Managers need a clear understanding of what 
            creates stress and how to deal with it effectively. The three parts 
            of the managing stress triangle are: l Demands l Coping skills l 
            Reactions <br>
            <br>
            <b>Demands:</b> CEOs face a variety of demands from work, family, 
            and self-imposed standards. Among other things, work demands include 
            heavy workload, tight deadlines, travel, demanding customers, upset 
            employees and personality conflicts. The workplace holds a plethora 
            of anxiety producers. Family demands include holidays and special 
            events, family conflicts, elder care, spending time with spouse or 
            significant other, spending time with the kids, and other household 
            chores like paying bills and weekend shopping. Self imposed 
            standards could include 'perfection', must dos and the likes. The 
            number of demands and their importance produces an overall 
            cumulative effect. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Coping skills:</b> This refers to the skills and techniques 
            people use to deal with life's demands. They include 
            management/interpersonal skills (goal-setting, prioritising, time 
            management, delegation etc.), emotional intelligence (managing one's 
            feelings and awareness), and relaxation techniques (stress and anger 
            management). <br>
            <br>
            <b>Reactions:</b> The number and severity of the demands managers 
            face and the level of their coping skills combine to produce a wide 
            range of reactions. For example, a person with excellent coping 
            skills facing moderate demands will get the job done with little to 
            no stress. On the other hand, a person with average coping skills 
            facing difficult demands will experience a great amount of stress. 
            Each individual has his own way of unwinding - working out, playing 
            golf, indulging in a hobby. The best managers know how to handle 
            more demands while maintaining low stress levels. Developing 
            effective coping skills is critical. What do our business leaders do 
            and why? <br>
            <br>
            Avers Lawati: &quot;I resort to tennis for physical exercise, which I 
            have been doing for the past 10-15 years. Lately, it had become 
            difficult to find time for it, but recently, I have been able to 
            devote an hour about three times a week for what I call 'sweating 
            sessions' on tennis courts at the PDO Recreation Centre. It's good 
            fun and good exercise. I also like reading philosophical, religious 
            and poetry books, for which I usually dedicate the last half hour 
            before I go to bed.'' <br>
            <br>
            &quot;I like to go for a swim once in a while, at times in the sea and at 
            others in a swimming pool. I also like touring in the interior of 
            Oman to visit historical places such as old villages, forts and 
            castles, and some of the key valleys and hill stations - 
            Misfat-al-Abriyeen is my favourite, and I make it a point to use the 
            opportunity of visitors (both business and private) to take them 
            around. Chess is another hobby of mine, which has been lately taking 
            a back seat waiting for the right partner and enough time,'' he 
            adds. <br>
            <br>
            And how do these leisure pursuits help him in recharging himself for 
            the grind? &quot;Diverting focus to something 'different' is always 
            useful. I feel quite happy with the balance and diversity in my 
            life, which allows me to have the level of intensity and focus that 
            my job needs. As a believing Muslim, it is also important to mention 
            that I find my life very organised and well-directed with the right 
            place defined for 'work' in a person's life. The only other thing to 
            add would be my (private) social activity in form of a weekly 
            get-together with friends and relatives, without which I would have 
            missed a lot.'' <br>
            <br>
            Khimji, on the other hand, is an avid practitioner of the Art of 
            Living (AOL), a voluntary, non-profitable organisation recognised by 
            the UN, that conducts personality development workshops and is 
            committed to developing 'full human potential and fostering human 
            values in the global society'. &quot;Besides being a volunteer, I look 
            after the organisation's activities in other countries in the GCC 
            and the Middle East. I am a member of the apex body of AOL and have 
            become an instructor since January this year,'' he informs. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="kr.jpg" hspace="5" align="right" width="200" height="156">Khimji practises his AOL breathing regimen daily without fail and 
            does a bit of meditation too. &quot;I am enjoying it - at the end of the 
            day, it brings a lot of joy and peace, and I feel really happy about 
            it. It keeps me busy after work. AOL has brought a lot of change in 
            my life,'' he maintains. Attending the AOL workshop, according to 
            Khimji, &quot;has brought a smile to my face. Earlier, I used to have a 
            lot of worries. I seldom used to smile. Attending the course has 
            helped me start accepting things as they are, and I have started 
            handling situations in a better way, which made me worry less,'' he 
            claims. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Play, that's how I rejuvenate myself,'' answers Carlough. &quot;We try 
            to walk on the beach or in the neighbourhood for a minimum 1 hour at 
            least four times a week. On long weekends, rare as they are, we 
            attempt to go diving. I also do a lot of camping during the winter 
            months and enjoy the wonderful hospitality of the people in the 
            interior. I have also been known to throw a tent up on the beach, 
            light a nice big fire and sit back and enjoy the great outdoors of 
            the wonderful Omani evening skies. Very relaxing! I must admit, 
            though, the best place I have found for my wife and I to rejuvenate 
            ourselves is under a palm tree at the local club, sitting in the 
            shade, reading and relaxing. Oh yes, I must admit I also go to a 
            nearby ayurveda clinic once a week for a relaxing massage. It really 
            works!'' he declares. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;I must admit that I spend a fair amount of time online with my 
            laptop keeping up to date with family at home, shopping and 
            generally using the Internet as a great source of information,'' he 
            adds. &quot;I've always been a 'water person', living and playing in 
            oceans, lakes and rivers; so, I continue to stay 'wet' here in Oman. 
            Some of the best beaches and coves I've ever seen are here In Oman. 
            I also enjoy photography and shoot whatever is available when I have 
            some free time. I've taken hundreds and hundreds of pictures of Oman 
            since I've been here and will continue to add to my collection. I've 
            been to the camel races, horse races, witnessed villagers dancing, 
            been up the wadis during rain storms, experienced the beauty of the 
            Khareef and have captured it all in my digital camera. I wish I had 
            more time for such activities. I need to take a vacation here In 
            Oman! Enjoyment is my battery re-charger,'' he adds. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;One thing I realise at this stage of my life is that my most 
            valuable asset is my time, and I am very conscious about it. I make 
            sure that I do my walk regularly to keep my body in shape. I am fond 
            of self-awareness and personal growth related endeavours. At this 
            stage of my life, I am very concerned about whether I am personally 
            growing, i.e., am I able to deal with my self, my ego, my reactions 
            to issues the way I would like it to be or is it, at most times, out 
            of my control. I generally would like to witness my own self in 
            terms of how am I reacting, how am I behaving, what am I saying... 
            So I do a lot of these relaxations, meditations. They act as a 
            release and definitely help to be in touch with oneself. I do get 
            into this mode every now and then,'' divulges Saher. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Before I came to Oman, I really did not have time for my family. 
            Oman has certainly given that tranquillity that I am able to spend 
            some amount of quality time with my family. I also play the keyboard 
            - just as fun. I never learnt it, but play it once in a while as a 
            way of letting my hair down. I also do my reading to make sure that 
            I am in touch with reality,'' he adds. <br>
            <br>
            Hobbs, a self-confessed dabbler, indulges in a lot of hobbies, but 
            pursues none too deeply. &quot;Firstly, I try to keep fit by going to the 
            gym thrice a week. I like the outdoors - I love the sunshine. But I 
            am also very keen on humour and music. I have a lot of music 
            instruments at home but I am very bad at them. My favourite 
            instrument is a banjo. I also play the guitar and keyboards. And if 
            I was in England, I'd be doing a lot more practical things like 
            building furniture and stuff. I am also into astronomy. And, of 
            course, exploring - we have a lot of good mountains around here in 
            Oman. I also like sailing.'' <br>
            <br>
            These activities, according to Hobbs, help him bounce back every 
            time he is down. &quot;I can get really down. I can go home at the end of 
            a particularly bad day and really never want to see this place (his 
            office) again. But somehow, you wake up the next morning and you are 
            back in here and you are bouncing back and you put whatever happened 
            yesterday behind you or at least try and do something about it. It's 
            no good dwelling on the downside - you just got to keep on going,'' 
            he says cheerfully. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;I love jokes because they kind of give you a mental refresher. It's 
            all quite calculated really - you run the risk of getting 
            overstressed by concentrating too much on something. At times, you 
            have to do that - but at the first opportunity you get, send the 
            mind off in a different direction - whether it be astronomy or music 
            or a silly joke or anything. That just kind of gives you a bit of 
            refresher and then you go back into it and start all over.'' <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, the CEO today has an unenviable task of effectively 
            managing shareholder expectations about the bottom line during an 
            economic downturn. The smart CEO today is choosing what not to 
            do--which jobs and offices to cut, which deals to scrap, which 
            products to stop--as well as looking to the future; which risks to 
            take, bargains to buy and innovations to make. Above all else, CEOs 
            need to keep one eye on tomorrow and create that vision for the 
            future.<br>
            <br>
            An effective CEO, therefore, looks to create relevance for every 
            audience, to balance the needs of the financial market with those of 
            employees and the societies in which the company operates. This 
            involves integrating corporate reputation very closely into business 
            strategy, and recognising that he makes a statement through his or 
            her values and behaviour. Today's CEO, operating in this Age of 
            Uncertainty, needs to be truth-teller, business leader, global 
            statesman, and above all else, confidence builder.</font></p>

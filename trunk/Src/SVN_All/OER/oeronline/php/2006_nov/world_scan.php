Indians set to dominate global steel</b><br>
Three of the top 10 global steel companies are set to fall into the hands of 
Indians with the Tata group taking over the Anglo-Dutch firm Corus at a cost of 
US$7.6 billion. A merger of Corus with Tata Steel will create the sixth largest 
steel producer in the world and would amount to the biggest takeover of a 
foreign firm by an Indian company. The Anglo-Dutch company is currently ranked 
the ninth largest steel producer in the world while Tata is ranked 56th and the 
merger will more than and quadruple their sales to US$23 billion. Corus has 
24,000 employees in Britain and 16,000 in Holland. <br>
<br>
At present, Lakshmi Nivas Mittal is the undisputed king of steel manufacturing 
with his Mittal Steel being the world’s largest manufacturer of the commodity, 
followed by Arcelor, which he took over earlier this year.<br>
<br>
In fact, for Tata Steel also, this will be the third takeover of a steel company 
abroad — having acquired Millennium Steel of Thailand and Singapore-based 
NatSteel for US$553 million to gain access in the Asia Pacific region.<br>

<b>Coke, Nestle to launch calorie-burning beverage</b><br>
<img border="0" src="pic71.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="125" height="127">Coca-Cola and Nestle, through their joint venture Beverage Partners Worldwide, 
are expected to launch in November a carbonated beverage that burns calories. 
Branded as Enviga, a sparkling green-tea drink under the Nestea name, it is 
claimed to be ‘calorie deficient’ rather than calorie-packed. It uses a blend of 
green-tea extracts known for boosting metabolism called Epigallocatechin gallate 
(EGCG). Enviga is expected to have twice the EGCG as leading competitors, no 
more caffeine than an average cup of coffee and 20 per cent of the daily value 
of calcium for men and women ages 19 to 50. <br>
<br>
“There’s calorie, low-calorie, zero-calorie, and now we offer consumers 
negative-calorie products,” said Jason Warner, Group Marketing Director for 
Beverage Partners Worldwide Americas, which has worked on the brand for the past 
three-and-a-half years. Enviga will be introduced in berry, peach and green-tea 
flavors (a citrus flavor is also slated for some regional markets). Currently, 
it is under test stage in Australia, Canada, Mexico and eight markets in Europe 
for an eventual global rollout.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="80%" size="1">

<b>Google acquires YouTube to deal a blow to Yahoo</b><br>
Google reshaped the landscape of search, grabbing YouTube in a US$1.65 billion 
stock deal. The deal is a blow to Yahoo, which has been struggling to catch up 
with Google in advertising — and has had little luck with its own online video 
experiments. <br>
<br>
Google CEO Eric Schmidt said the advent of video was the next step in the 
evolution of the Internet, and YouTube brand had great value for users, the 
company, and advertisers. Indeed, the startup that’s held legions captivated by 
quirky videos may be the next story of entertainment delivered via Internet, if 
only it can steer clear of legal landmines, and may hold the ticket to draw 
advertisers seeking richer media forms.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="80%" size="1">

<b>Apple blames Microsoft for virus in iPods</b><br>
<img border="0" src="pic72.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="175" height="112">Apple apologised recently for shipping video iPods containing the Windows virus 
RavMonE.exe, which apparently made its way onto a small number of the ubiquitous 
devices at a manufacturing plant. Around one per cent of the units shipped after 
September 12, 2006, are affected. <br>
RavMonE.exe is a mass storage virus that only affects Windows computers. 
According to anti-virus vendors, which dub the malware Win32.RJump.a and Troj/Bdoor-DIJ, 
the virus is a Trojan that opens links to websites and allows others access to a 
computer. After installation, the Trojan contacts several remote sites to report 
the infection and availability of the backdoor, according to security firm 
Sophos, which rates it as a low risk infection. All up-to-date anti-virus 
applications should detect and remove the virus.<br>
“The iPod nano, iPod shuffle and Mac OS X are not affected, and all Video iPods 
now shipping are virus free,” Apple said in a statement on its support site. The 
company also took the opportunity to blast Microsoft’s Windows operating system 
for not doing more to protect customers from such malware. “As you might 
imagine, we are upset at Windows for not being more hardy against such viruses, 
and even more upset with ourselves for not catching it,” Apple said.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="80%" size="1">

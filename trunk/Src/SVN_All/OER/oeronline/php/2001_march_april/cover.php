                    Cover Story<br>
                    </font>Special Report: Yemen</font>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Omani companies with an appetite for rapid international expansion are eyeing up investment and trade opportunities in Yemen's fast-emerging economy. Some are ahead of plan but none are nowhere near tapping the market fully. OER reports on the investment potential in the Sultanate's southern neighbour</b></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yemen has serious potential. This is the verdict of many Omani companies which are already devoting significant resources and capital to exploit considerable gaps in the market. And analysts forecast that these firms could play an important role in increasing business activity in growth sectors and fuel a surge in Yemen's development and modernisation.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    According to KPMG Mejanni Hazem Hassan &amp; Co. (KPMG Yemen), Yemen's short-term macroeconomic indicators are difficult to forecast reliably because of the country's significant dependence on the price of oil. However, over the medium to long term, current positive trends can be expected to continue as long as the political situation remains essentially stable. Yemen's government has signalled that it intends to continue current conservative macroeconomic policies as well as accelerate administrative and legal reforms.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, average overall economic growth is expected to remain between 4.0% to 8.0% with inflation seen remaining in the 5.0% to 10% range and the domestic treasury bill and prime lending rates remaining around inflation plus 10%. However, year-to-year fluctuations could swing well outside these ranges depending upon short-term changes in oil prices and international exchange rates. Yemen's GDP growth has averaged more than 5.0% per year since 1995, despite a sharp dip in 1998 due to low oil prices. Inflation has remained between 5.0% to 15% per year throughout this period.<br>
                    <br>
                    The most significant weakness in the macroeconomic picture is Yemen's dependence on oil income which represents 25% to 30% of GDP. Oil production is currently stable, but in world terms Yemen is a small producer with an output of about 465,000 barrels of oil per day. One of Yemen's major fields is expected to be depleted within the next five to 10 years. However, two new commercial discoveries, growth in other existing fields and continued exploration offer a realistic hope of replacing this. In the same time frame, Yemen's long anticipated gas project is expected to come on-line, providing both significant domestic electric power and export earnings. Yemen LNG's two-train facility at the coastal town of Bal Haf is set to to have a capacity of 3.1 million tonnes per year (mtpa), half the current capacity of Oman LNG's Qalhat plant.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to experts, Yemen's economy will continue to be dominated by the oil and gas sector, which will finance strong domestic growth in trade, construction, financial services and telecommunications. Agriculture growth, which has also been historically strong due to movement from traditional crops to cash crops - particularly in the tobacco plant qat - is expected to gradually taper off. Importing qat into the US is illegal and the EU is reported to be looking at banning its trade also. Most suitable farms have already made this conversion and agricultural production has now surpassed the limits of the water supply in some areas.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The industrial and tourism sectors both have significant unexploited potential to grow rapidly, however this will depend on inflows of foreign direct investment. Foreign investor confidence has been hurt by recent high profile incidents which have portrayed Yemen's security situation negatively.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Other government initiatives are expected to contribute directly to economic growth. The accelerating privatization program includes a number of industries with clear export potential. Yemen also continues its efforts to work towards WTO membership and to negotiate more favorable terms of trade with the European Union.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Jotun Paints:</b> New factory given green light&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Jotun Paints Oman (JPO) LLC, searching for deeper market penetration in Yemen, is aiming to achieve some 30% market share by 2005, according to Jotun Paints Oman General Manager Vijay Kumar who revealed to OER that the firm is close to signing a deal to start construction on a paint factory at a cost of over RO2.0 million in either Sana'a or Taiz.<br>
                    <br>
                    "We have around a 10% market share in Yemen's paints sector today. The domestic market is huge with many millions of consumers demanding quality paint products. Aden's port expansion and free trade zone will play a major role in enhancing future scope and sales. Development in the oil and gas sector and project finance from the World Bank together with prevailing stability in the economic and political structure will guarantee that our initial investment will be protected," said Kumar.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    JPO also has plans to extend the 150 dealerships that currently exist in Yemen. "The 35% customs duty on our exports didn't make Jotun's products very competitive with locally manufactured products and we felt very limited. However, when we start our local plant we plan to have the sales and marketing strength in place to expand in a much stronger way," he added.<br>
                    <br>
                    Construction on the facility is expected to begin in the next three to four months while paint production will begin in the second quarter of 2002.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Jotun Paints Oman currently has 15 staff in Yemen but when the plant opens, this number is likely to exceed 45. "We intend to utilise local labout to its maxiumum and envisage 95% localisation including senior management. Only marketing and technical services will be headed by expatriate Jotun staff. Yemen is a huge market for us with as many as 15 million consumers demanding quality paint products. Aden's free trade zone and port will play a major role in enhancing the future scope and guarantee that initial investment in a new paint plant is protected," says the Jotun chief. "We expect to see a boom in construction activities during the next five to 10 years."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Jotun's strategy is to focus on decorative paints and marine protective coatings, adds Kumar listing Yemen Petroleum, Yemen Refinery, the Ministry of Defence, Hunt Oil and several major civil construction projects, such as five-star hotels and hospitals, as customers.<br>
                    <br>
                    Jotun's local partner is the Hayel Saeed Anam (HAS) Group, an international conglomerate employing over 17,500 people which also claims to be the biggest retailing group in Yemen. It represents over 50 blue-chip companies including Ford, Philips, Michelin, JVC, Olympus, Lucent Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Squibb, Acer, Wella Intercosmetic, Daewoo, Smithkline Beecham, Gillette UK Ltd, JVC, Sharp, Cadburys, Unilever International, Mount Blanc and BP Chemicals. HSA also operates the largest tobacco factory in the Middle East and manufactures Rothmans and Dunhill cigarettes.<br>
                    <br>
                    "Jotun first identified Yemen as a possible expansion destination in the early 1990s but the Gulf War put many of these plans on ice. The idea re-materialised in 1996 when we made a firm commitment with our local sponsor to boost our exports," said Kumar.<br>
                    <br>
                    The government actually achieved budget surpluses in 1998 and 1999, and a foreign current account surplus throughout 2000. During 2000, the Central Bank paid off most domestic debt to try to keep the Yemeni rial from depreciating. This action injected large amounts of cash into the local economy, resulting in inflation of over 12% for 2000.<br>
                    <br>
                    As long as the government remains committed to fiscal responsibility and use of monetary policy to manage both inflation and currency stability, strong economic growth and stable inflation are likely. Abrupt swings in oil prices over the past two years made economic management difficult as they simultaneously drove the current account, government revenues and the value of the Yemeni rial.<br>
                    <br>
                    Political stability is also likely to continue to grow as Yemen has had increasingly competitive elections over the past six years. The president and cabinet are gradually ceding more power to Parliament and local administrators. Emphasis on both decentralization and legislation by consensus creates a form of political inertia common in mature democracies, so that policy becomes less dependent on individual personality. This creates policy continuity that can outlast a change in government. Yemen also boasts the most press freedom in the Middle East.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Oman Cables:</b> Phased growth possible&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Oman Cables Co. (OCC) SAOG designs and manufactures electrical power and control cables, overhead line conductors, instrumentation cables as well as other wires and cables for electronic devices. Aside from the governments of Oman and Yemen, the company has previously received orders from UK-based Denge Power Products, Italy's Snamprogetti, Chiyoda Foster Wheeler of Japan and the UK and Brunei Darussalem.<br>
                    <br>
                    In February 2000, Oman Cables executed a RO35,000 turnkey electrification project in Yemen supplying cables, instrumentation and conductors to Yemen's Ministry of Electricty. The Gharb Masar Ruba'a Matwah power project's main objective was to supply electricity to remote rural areas of Yemen.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    With infrastructure development a major priority for Yemen's government, OCC officials are confident that they can win similar tenders in the future and are actively promoting the company's products through exhibitions in Yemen's major cities and via direct marketing. Between May 21 to 23, OCC will be attending an investment conference in Aden being organised by the Oman Centre for Investment, Promotion and Export Development (Ociped).&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "Yemen has good access. We did not find any difficulties with insurance or getting our shipment over to Aden using Mukalla as a gateway. We definitely see a good potential for expanding our business in Yemen and feel that we have made a good start," said Saud Khalid, senior sales engineer at OCC.<br>
                    <br>
                    "At the moment, we see Saudi Arabian manufacturers as our biggest threat although now that they also need a local sponsor to set up their business activities in Yemen following the Gulf War, there is much more of a level playing field. Certainly, the negative perception associated with Yemen is a help to us as we know it paints a much more cloudier picture of the country than that which truly exists," he added.<br>
                    <br>
                    Analysts said they chiefly agree that non-Arab investor confidence has been hurt recently by uniformly negative international press coverage providing greater opportunities for investors from within the region. Apart from the oil sector, investors may expect little competition from Western based multinationals. Khalid said: "In the future, we are not ruling out the possibility of setting up a sales office in Yemen but this does really depend on the success we achieve this year."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, the Yemeni economy is one of the least regulated in the world with little regulation over labour or the environment, a liberal investment law and no foreign exchange controls. Taxes are lower than in most non-oil economies, for example 20% maximum on salaries and 35% on company profits. A free trade zone is now open to investors in the Port of Aden. Labour costs and rents are the lowest in the region.<br>
                    <br>
                    Current investment law is aimed at sectors targeted for development, including manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, tourism, construction and transportation. It provides for rapid licensing of new businesses and generous tax incentives including exemption from company profit tax for seven years or more, exemption from all customs duties on imported fixed assets and additional incentives for export production.<br>
                    <br>
                    Other businesses, including banking, insurance, oil and gas, and service industries, may operate as branches of foreign corporations, which may be registered easily and are 100% foreign owned and managed. In fact, businesses in any sector except retailing may now be 100% foreign owned.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Khimji Ramdas:</b> Trading places<br>
                    <br>
                    Pankaj Khimji, director and chief executive of Khimji Ramdas, says that the potential for Omani companies to retail successfully in Yemen is phenomenal: "The potential for trading consumer durables with a low unit outlay is very large in Yemen. Its high volume low cost retailing that works when manufacturing food consumables. (For example) you wouldn't sell many 12-pack Mars bars but you would sell the minis in singles, and you would sell far more individually than in packs."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "Yemen is probably one of the largest consumers of biscuits in the world and I believe the per capita consumption of confectionary is also one of the highest in the world and definitely the highest in the region. Being the managing director of a biscuit company called Al Sabah Industries, I researched this and have been proved right about such consumption."&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Al Sabah Industries, a subsiduary of Khimji Ramdas, is based in Sohar and produces cookies under the name of Bakers Pride, exporting to 40 countries. It started exporting products to Yemen in 1997. "Unfortunately, we have been held back because of the credit situation, so you have got to make sure you either have cash up front or money in a bank or a bankers draft from an approved bank. There is a real cash crunch for foreign traders in Yemen, but it is easing up," he added.<br>
                    <br>
                    Khimji said that as a developing economy Yemen is slightly behind developed economies by about 10 years in terms of infrastructure and economic development infrastructure. Although there is an opportunity for Omani companies, there is a steep learning curve period where such businesses would have to invest and make sure they are well capitalized over that period. Government assistance from Yemen or Oman is currently what many firms are looking for before any firm investment decision is taken.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "Today, Yemen is good for trading but not for investing. The economic scenario is very fluid and you are always wary of the security of doing business, so why go there if you are doing fine in Oman and UAE," says Khimji. "We put a little shop in the free trade area located in Aden's port hoping for cross border trade but the results were very disappointing."<br>
                    <br>
                    Certain sectors in Yemen have exhibited dramatic growth in recent years. Oil and gas production and related services continue to expand, with two companies announcing new commercial discoveries in 2000, and a natural gas project set to begin development this year. The banking sector has also expanded rapidly, with two new commercial banks and three new Islamic banks starting operations over the last five years.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The telecommunications industry has also opened up. Two new GSM providers will begin operations shortly and a nationwide network of prepaid card-based telephones was launched last year. The Internet monopoly was also cancelled during 2000.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Zubair Telecom:</b> Connecting with Yemen<br>
                    <br>
                    In September 2000, the Zubair Group as part of Satellite Communications Yemen (Spacetel Yemen), was awarded a licence by Yemen's Communications Ministry to establish and operate a local cellular telephone network. Under the terms of the agreement, Spacetel Yemen will invest $100 million over a four-year period, $25 million in 2001. Zubair Telecommunications Co. LLC, a subsiduary company of the Zubair Group, is supplying the technical assistance and equipment.<br>
                    <br>
                    The company will offer services in at least major nine cities and on the principal routes between them. Beginning with a customer base of 50,000, the company aims to increase its customer base to 250,000 within the next two to three years. Spacetel is headed by Beirut-based Investcom and Oman Telecommunications Co. (Omantel) is also part of the consortium. Spacetel will compete with Egyptian and Yemeni Sabaphone which signed its licence on July 29.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The newly refurbished Port of Aden, its free trade zone and the nearby international airport - now under modernization - offers the shipping industry modern facilities, low costs, the best location in the region, little competition and an open regulatory environment.<br>
                    <br>
                    Tourism is another sector full of unexplored possibilities. Yemen combines friendly people, breathtaking mountains and beaches, beautiful weather and unique architecture and cultural traditions that evoke the greatness of an ancient civilization not yet spoiled by crowds of tourists.<br>
                    <br>
                    Agro-industry and fisheries also have significant unexploited resources and export potential, and little competition for those who enter the market now. Basic manufacturing, such as furniture and clothing, offer the export advantage of a large pool of skilled labor coupled to extremely low costs.<br>
                    <br>
                    Businesses under privatization offer opportunities for immediate investment, including two banks, an oil refinery, pharmaceutical and cement manufacturers, two transportation sector entities, and over thirty small manufacturing businesses, mainly in the food and clothing sectors. Negotiations are ongoing relating to two private projects in the electricity-generating sector. Future sectors slated for privatization include telecommunications and the national airline.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Information technology is another advancing sector in Yemen. While the industry is still in its infancy, many regional players are looking to provide a need for a local service and specialised, differentiated needs such as Arabic software and solutions. However, instituting and enforcing intellectual property rights laws is as much an issue in this economy as other GCC states.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Imtac:</b> Tapping the digital economy and moving into pharmacuticals&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Imtac LLC, the technology division of Renaissance Holdings SAOG, has been making significant advances in Yemen's information technolgy and manufacturing sectors despite solely concentrating on the service sector in Oman. Jayante Deshpande, assistant general manager of Imtac Yemen Ltd, a joint-venture company between Imtac and Yemen's Griffin Ltd, says: "When we first explored Yemen's possibilities in 1993 we found many more opportunities in areas outside our key competencies so in some areas we have gone beyond our normal scope than that which we adopt in Oman."<br>
                    <br>
                    Many of the mega-projects are funded by the United Nations, World Bank, European Union and Islamic Dvelopment Bank. The funds are tangible and companies outside of Yemen's borders can pitch for such projects despite having a slightly higher cost than local companies, submitting proposals at international bidding levels.<br>
                    <br>
                    "During an exploratory mission to Yemen in 1994, we received some major orders. That gave us the primary boost. But during 1995 communication was severed during civil unrest. Some nine months later the conditions improved but it took three years for us to regain our momentum and execute our orders," he explained.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1998, Imtac was awarded a RO1.0 million project from the World Bank to develop vocational training institutes across Yemen, beating 14 other bids from the US and Europe. In 1999, the company signed a major contract with Yemen's Ministry of Health to supply medical gases to its hospitals for a period of five years. A pharmacutical plant to produce the gases was commisioned at a cost of about RO1.0 million and is set to start production in March. It will employ 40 people, 32 from Yemen and eight from Oman.<br>
                    <br>
                    "People used to and still think of Yemen as a question mark, so it is important to find a good partner with good contacts and a solid reputation to protect your orders, secure business and help win bids," said the Imtac official. Imtac employed the services of Haitham Al Ainey, chairman of Griffin Ltd, the local sponsor for multinationals including Total, Fedex and Abbott Diagnostics.<br>
                    <br>
                    "The market is much larger and will increase at a fast rate and I do not foresee stagnation in the near future. However, there are still many challenges in Yemen for Omani companies. There is a perennial shortage of power but this together with a massive expansion of the local telecommunications sector is improving. Typically, many private sector companies delay payment. You are not sure when you will receive payment or whether you will be paid at all. Dealing with the government or oil companies is a major advantage guaranteeing certain payment mostly on time. Also, the UAE is marketing in Yemen in a very aggressive manner," he added.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    "There isn't a good road to Yemen. Oman's transportation companies would have excellent opportuinities if the road structure improves and security becomes more assured. Moreover, insurance coverage is not fully comprehensive for companies wishing to export to Yemen," Deshpande said.<br>
                    <br>
                    But the infrastructure is improvng and, Deshpande said, as it does, Omani companies who get in quick will also be able to use Yemen as a launch pad for exporting to Africa.&nbsp;<br>

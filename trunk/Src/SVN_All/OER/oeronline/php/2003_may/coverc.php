            the list on the basis of Revenues. In the case of banks, the Gross 
            Interest Income as well as Other Operating Income together is 
            considered as their Revenue for this purpose. All figures are for 
            the year ended December 31, 2002, unless otherwise stated. <br>

            </b>The Dividend Yield figure is calculated on the basis of dividend 
            declared in the financial statements for 2002 against the share 
            price at close of business on December 31, 2002. At the time of

            <br>
            <b>Price-Earnings ratio<br>

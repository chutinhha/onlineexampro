<img border="0" src="scan.jpg" width="100" height="68" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">US Chip giant Intel’s upcoming Penryn processors will boost computer speed by 40 
per cent for gaming, compared to existing top-line chips, the company said. The 
chips, expected to hit the market in the second half of 2007, would also 
increase performance by an estimated 45 per cent for bandwidth-intensive 
applications, Patrick Gelsinger, the company’s general manager for digital 
enterprise, said at the Intel Developer’s Forum in Beijing. Gelsinger added the 
chip would allow performance increases of about 15 per cent for imaging-related 
applications, 25 per cent for 3-D rendering, and more than 40 per cent for video 
encoding.<br>
<br>
Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, held its developer’s forum in 
China just a month after announcing plans for a US$2.5 billion chip plant in the 
north-eastern Chinese city of Dalian. The new plant reflects a new focus by the 
company on China which is expected to help the country evolve into a more 
high-tech manufacturing centre.<br>

</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">India and the United States expect a new high on bilateral trade, revved up by 
imports of US motorcycles and the sale of Indian mangoes to Americans. After 
years of blocking import of Indian fruits, the United States last year allowed 
Indian mangoes into its domestic markets. This followed a visit to New Delhi by 
US President George W Bush in March 2006.<br>
<br>
“Last year, total bilateral trade in goods rose to nearly US$32 billion,” US 
Trade Representative Susan Schwab told a business forum in New Delhi. “This 
year, total combined trade in goods and services could well surpass US$50 
billion,” she said. Schwab’s Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said Indian and US 
trade delegations had exhaustive discussions on bilateral trade “from Harley 
Davidsons to mangoes.” He said, “The good news is that Harley Davidsons will 
come to India and Indian mangoes will go to the United States”.<br>
<br>
Both sides also discussed infringement of intellectual property rights with New 
Delhi asking Washington to crack down on those marketing pirated versions of 
Indian films in the US market. “We raised the issue of widespread availability 
of pirated Indian films and music in the US... it can be found in any grocery 
store. The US has assured us it will look into it,” Nath said.<br>

Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company, has confirmed a US$5.5 billion cash 
deal to buy US baby-food maker Gerber from Novartis AG, furthering its push into 
the nutrition business. Nestle said the deal would give its growing nutrition 
division – which includes infant formula, baby food, medical nutrition, weight 
management and performance nutrition – annual sales of around 10 billion Swiss 
francs (US$8.21 billion). Gerber, a household name in the United States, will 
generate an estimated US$1.95 billion in net proceeds from sales in 2007, Nestle 
said.<br>
<br>
Although Nestle is the world’s biggest maker of infant nutritional products, it 
lacked a baby food brand in the US and has been keen to buy Gerber for more than 
a decade. An acquisition of Gerber would continue Nestle’s push into health and 
nutrition. Nestle recently bought the medical nutrition business of Novartis for 
US$2.5 billion, but that deal did not include Gerber.<br>

</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Calling home from European beaches will be cheaper for mobile phone users this 
summer if EU lawmakers and the European Commission get their way on planned caps 
for so-called roaming rates. Plans to force operators to charge less on 
cross-border calls in the European Union got a boost last week when a key EU 
panel backed the package in the face of fierce lobbying from operators fearful 
of losing revenues.<br>
<br>
The European Parliament’s industry committee voted broadly in favour of capping 
the price of calls made abroad in the EU at 40 cents per minute and 15 cents for 
calls received abroad. The committee’s backing sets the stage for a vote before 
the full parliament in a plenary session on May 10 in Brussels and a final 
decision by EU telecom ministers on June 7 in Luxembourg. After the vote, the 
bill’s rapporteur, Austrian conservative Paul Ruedig, said: “We are sending a 
very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators. It’s a good basis for 
our deliberations. I now expect swift and successful negotiations with (EU 
governments) so that the new roaming regulation can be enforced indeed before 
summer,” he said.<br>

The world economy is poised for its longest expansion since the early 1970s 
despite a US housing slowdown and financial market instability, the 
International Monetary Fund has said.<br>
<br>
In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF said growth in global gross 
domestic product (GDP) would reach 4.9 per cent both this year and next. While 
down from 5.4 per cent in 2006, it would take the current expansion into its 
fifth and sixth years, the global economy’s best performance since before the 
1970s’ oil shocks. “By and large things look very good,” IMF chief economist 
Simon Johnson told a news conference, playing down what is likely to be 
America’s weakest economic performance in five years.<br>
<br>
Unlike in the 1970s, according to Johnson, growth is far more widespread as 
China and India extend dramatic transformations, while Europe and Japan look set 
to outstrip US growth this year. “Everyone around the world is sharing in this 
prosperity. I hesitate to say that it is unprecedented, but it is very 
impressive,” he said. “While the US indeed may have sneezed, it appears to be a 
mild sneeze so far, and not likely to spread.” Given the right policy mix 
worldwide, Johnson added, “I think we can sustain global growth around 5 per 
cent a year for some time to come.”<br>
<br>
Eurozone growth is on course to overtake the United States for the first time 
since 2001, although both regions are expected to lose steam this year, the Fund 
said in its twice-yearly report. The IMF fretted about the potential for a 
sharper slowdown in the US, whose GDP growth was forecast to dip to 2.2 per cent 
in 2007 from 3.3 per cent last year. That was a big downgrade from the 2007 
growth pace of 2.9 per cent that the IMF had predicted in September. There are 
“some very tentative signs” that the US housing market could be stabilising, but 
the Fund warned that the property shakeout has some way to run.<br>

</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">China aims to nearly halve by 2020 the amount of greenhouse gases it emits for 
each dollar of its economy, but will reject strict caps for decades, a copy of a 
national global warming assessment seen by Reuters shows.<br>
<br>
Beijing has been reticent about what the world’s number-two carbon emitter is 
prepared to do to tackle global warming. While the report shows officials 
believe it is a serious threat, it suggests they do not want to take preventive 
steps that could hobble economic growth. </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><br>

China’s Middle East Policy</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>The likely result of the intense competition in Central Asia could mean that the 
Chinese majors may be looking to place their investments in fields closer to 
home, away from the Gulf<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="eco.jpg" width="156" height="454" align="right" hspace="6">As Cina’s demand for resources grows to fuel its burgeoning economy, the role 
that the Middle East, especially Oman, is playing is also increasing. Although 
the Western majors
will continue to play a strong role in the Middle Eastern oil industry, China is 
looking to insert itself into valuable niches to guarantee both stability and 
variety of supply to its home market. The Middle East will remain a key target 
for Chinese oil companies, though the country’s ability to access supplies in 
sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia may insert a level of competition between 
producers for China’s attention.<br>
<br>
In 2005, China consumed some 2.5 billion barrels of oil, increasing by 7 per 
cent on year-on-year terms. With economic growth being a strong 10.7 per cent in 
2006, the growing needs of China’s 1.3 billion population are only to likely 
grow vigorously. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects oil demand in 
China to grow by 6.1 per cent in 2007, rising to 7.56 million barrels a day. 
Production within China is no longer keeping up with demand, despite increasing 
1.7 per cent in 2006. Some 47 per cent of the country’s needs are being met 
through imports, with the Middle East supplying 58 per cent of the total. Iran, 
Saudi Arabia and Oman provided most of this supply. <br>
<br>
<b>Oil trade</b><br>
For Oman, China represented 84.3 million barrels, or 32.2 per cent, of its 
overall oil exports in volume terms in 2005, slightly down on the 106.4 million 
barrels, or 40.4 per cent, recorded in 2004. East Asia dominates the Omani oil 
export picture, accounting for 99.1 per cent of all production. China has done 
more than simply being a willing recipient of oil from Oman, and its oil 
companies have won exploration and production rights over blocks 36 and 38 in 
southern Oman, worth an estimated $600 million in investment over the coming 
years. The two largest markets for China in the Middle East, however, remain 
Saudi Arabia and Iran, with energy deals and exploration agreements in the 
works, especially with Tehran.<br>
<br>
China’s move into the international oil and gas arena has been championed 
primarily by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), China Petroleum 
and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec), and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). 
In 2005-06, these emerging oil majors spent some $12 billion on investments and 
exploration. Unlike other oil majors, the Chinese companies have shown a 
willingness to get into difficult and niche markets, as well as accept lower 
rates of return, all to ensure sufficient supply for the home market. However, 
this does not mean that China has managed to establish a completely independent 
supply of energy. According to Eurasia Group, only around 320,000 bpd worth of 
equity oil flows into China, less than 10 per cent of present imports.<br>
<br>
In order to boost the level of exploration and investment of these firms, the 
Chinese government has offered a range of tax incentives for activities in 
Bolivia, Ecuador, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Niger, Norway and Oman. The mix 
presents a good balance between established and secure oil producers as well as 
new, slightly riskier and untested markets.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, key states such as Iran, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia were not put on 
the list, and even promising producers such as Egypt and Sudan – in which the 
Chinese are already seeking a role – were not included. China’s reticence in 
some markets may be influenced by the questionable contracts that were done with 
Iraq prior to 2003, with the deals inked with the Baathist government now on ice 
under the present Iraqi administration.<br>
<br>
<b>Central Asian market</b><br>
Aside from the Middle East, Central Asia represents the next big opportunity for 
China to secure energy supplies. The 2005 purchase of PetroKazakhstan and the 
opening of a pipeline into northwest China from Kazakhstan demonstrate that 
China is attempting to create a “near abroad” of interests. By assisting in the 
development of the Kazakh oil infrastructure, China is aiming to source 15 per 
cent of its imports from the Central Asian state.<br>
<br>
However, China is in a competitive market, and Russian and Central Asian oil and 
gas is also being sought by Japan. China has so far managed to maintain Russia’s 
favour, and it looks as if any extension of the pipeline network from Siberia 
will be to the benefit of China as a primary export destination. For the 
Americans and British, such pipelines threaten the primacy of the Baku-Ceyhan 
pipeline across Turkey, which was constructed with the eventual goal of being 
the window to the Mediterranean for Central Asian energy exporters. Hemmed in as 
they are geographically, the Central Asian states are very much the centre of 
massive speculation and intrigue as to how their energy resources will get to 
the market. Other competing routes include Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. For 
Oman and other more developed states, the likely result of the intense 
competition in Central Asia could mean that the Chinese majors may be looking to 
place their investments in fields closer to home.<br>
<br>
However, as indicated by the spread of interests China has shown, it appears to 
be most keen in investing in markets where the major Western oil majors are not 
present, or where competition from them is absent because of political concerns. 
Sub-Saharan Africa has been a particular target, with China still heavily 
involved in the Sudanese and Angolan markets, while looking to expand into a 
number of other African countries. Oil from Sudan made up about 5 per cent of 
China’s supply in 2005, or around half of Sudan’s oil exports. Angola has 
exported some 700,000 bpd in oil to China, and a number of mixed equity deals 
are being secured. The core reasons for this African expansion are to provide a 
diversity of sources for China; though in the process, it has been exposed to 
some decidedly less stable partners. Through a combination of trade and aid, 
China seeks to woo and hopefully stabilise such countries, as well as extend its 
diplomatic and economic reach into softer markets.<br>
<br>
China also has the ability to further develop its own energy reserves, but to do 
so would require the resolution of long smouldering border disputes with its 
neighbours. Japan and China are slowly beginning to resolve their border dispute 
in the China Sea, though the likelihood of that paving the way for exploration 
may not be any time soon. The South China Sea dispute is far more intractable. 
Involving the competing claims of China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam 
and Brunei, the chances of this supposedly gas-rich zone being opened up are 
even less likely.<br>
<br>
Overall, for China the energy landscape remains a volatile place. In its need to 
fuel the engine of economic growth, it is being forced into more and more 
unreliable markets. It is possible that over the long term the chances it is 
taking will pay off, but for now the countries of the Gulf can breathe a sigh of 
relief. China will remain a good customer for the foreseeable future, and even 
if it manages to diversify its supplies, fresh demand will soak these up. </font></p>

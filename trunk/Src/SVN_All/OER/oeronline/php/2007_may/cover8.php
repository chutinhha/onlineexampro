<b>Oman Aviation has a lot to offer in the days to come, as was 
indicated in 2006</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover_8b.jpg" width="175" height="220" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">For a company that completed 25 years of operation in 2006 and showed improved 
results during the year following the turnaround in 2004 and 2005, going down by 
two steps is a lot. Blame it on Oman Cables and OIB, Oman Aviation Services Co. 
(OAS) has found itself in the ninth place. However, for the third year in a row, 
Oman Aviation recorded impressive results and reported a profit of RO2.893 
million in 2006 compared to RO1.006 million in 2005. <br>
<br>
Oman Air recorded an all-round performance in all operational segments of its 
business. It carried 1.226 million passengers, an increase of 91,000 passengers 
or eight per cent over the previous year. The capacity growth at Oman Air is at 
a measured pace of two per cent which matched traffic growth of two per cent 
during the year 2006. The average seat factor across the network remained at a 
healthy level of 76%. The average aircraft utilisation remained high at 12.6 
block hours per day per aircraft, one of the highest in the industry. <br>
<br>
In Airport Service Group business, Oman Aviation handled 23,545 flights (an 
increase of 16 per cent), passenger movement of 4.521 million (an increase of 33 
per cent), cargo tonnage of 67,700 metric tons (an increase of 22 per cent), and 
catered 4.237 million meals to airline passengers (an increase of 28 per cent 
over the previous year).<br>
<br>
“Escalating fuel cost is one of the impediments to delivering a year-on-year 
improvement in earnings. However, Oman Air posted an improved performance in 
2006 against the increase in fuel price which was higher by 19 per cent in 
comparison to the previous year. Fuel prices are expected to remain at current 
level at least in the short term. However, in view of supply side constraints 
and growing demand, we do not anticipate fuel prices to decline any further,” 
said H.E. Said Bin Hamdoon Bin Saif Al Harthy, Chairman, Oman Aviation.<br>
<br>
<b>Industry Scenario<br>
</b>IATA’s traffic results for 2006 indicate a global passenger growth of 5.9 per 
cent in comparison to 7.6 per cent in 2005. However, the global cargo growth 
rate increased to 4.6 per cent from 3.2 per cent during the previous year. 
Average passenger load factors in 2006 rose to 76 per cent up from 75.1 per cent 
during 2005. “The industry expects to post an operating profit of US $10.2 
billion during 2006 with net losses at US $ 500 million. The industry’s cautious 
approach in building the capacity, cost reduction measures, and improved 
efficiencies have resulted in improved performance during 2006,” Al Harthy said.<br>
<br>
Middle East continues to be the fastest growing region with the passenger and 
cargo recording an annual growth of 15.4 per cent and 16.1 per cent, 
respectively. Oman Air continued its focus on being a niche regional carrier 
with Muscat as its hub, and strengthened its presence in the Middle East and the 
Indian sub-continent. During the year, Oman Air flew more than 1.226 million 
passengers. New route of Amman was started and additional frequencies were 
deployed on profitable routes. In Airport Services business, the company handled 
23,545 flights and 4.521 million passengers at Seeb airport. Flight movement was 
higher by 16% due to increased operations mainly by Gulf Air, Etihad Airways, 
Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Turkish Airlines.<br>
<br>
<b>Financial Performance</b><br>
Net profit for 2006 was RO2.893 million compared to RO1.006 million in the 
previous year. Profit from operations was RO5.023 million compared to RO2.315 
million in 2005. The adoption of IAS 37 with regard to maintenance provision and 
IAS 16 with regard to component depreciation had a favourable impact on the 
income statement. <br>
<br>
Airport Services, which includes Ground Handling, Cargo Handling and Catering 
Services, witnessed enhanced profitability with the increase in passenger 
movement and catering uplift at Seeb airport. Scheduled services revenue was 
RO62.564 million, higher by RO5.769 million or 10% compared to the previous 
year. Passenger traffic rose by 91,000 passengers or 8%. This was achieved due 
to full year impact of the operations to Delhi and Hyderabad started in June 
2005, new route of Amman in December 2006, and the increase in operations on 
certain profitable routes. The lease of 2 ATR 42 500 aircraft to Deccan Aviation 
Private Limited also brought in additional revenue. Air Charter Services 
recorded a revenue of RO5.089 million, a decrease of RO140,000 from the previous 
year on account of step-down charges applicable during the extension period as 
per our contract with PDO. PDO will upgrade the services to jet operations 
effective January 2008. Handling revenue for the year was RO12.079 million, an 
increase of RO2.515 million or 26% over the previous year’s revenue of RO9.564 
million. Catering revenue during the year recorded RO6.104 million, an increase 
of RO1.378 million or 29% compared to RO 4.726 million reported in the previous 
year. Net Expenditure increased only by 9% from RO74.022 million to RO80.892 
million, as against a 13% increase in revenue. The increase in cost is mainly on 
account of fuel which rose by RO2.816 million or 19%.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Outlook</b><br>
The healthy growth of the carriers in the region is expected to continue for the 
next five years, with increase in passenger and freight traffic. The region has 
witnessed a rapid expansion and addition of capacity by major players. Expansion 
by other carriers on destinations presently served by Oman Air will pose a 
threat in terms of intense competition for market share and resultant decline in 
yields. However, with a sustained pursuit of its core plan to be a strong and 
quality niche regional airline, the Company is well geared to offset the adverse 
impact erosion of its market share. Oman Air will also further strengthen its 
presence on existing routes with a focus on high frequencies, on-time 
performance, quick turnarounds, convenient flight timings, good connectivity, 
and high standards of customer service, both on the ground and in the air. High 
fuel prices continue to be a threat and can negate improvements in all other 
areas. The proposed phased expansion of Seeb and Salalah airports will benefit 
the Airport Services business.</font></p>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Oman Aviation Services is raising its paid up capital to RO50 million from 
RO13.28 million by privately placing shares in favour of the government. The 
company describes the rationale of raising capital as ‘scaling up of operations’ 
to add long haul routes through the acquisition of larger-size aircraft, which 
involves huge capital outlays. However, due to the high acquired cost, the 
company anticipates it could endure financial losses at least for the next five 
years. Long haul operations take much more time to break even than short haul 
services, and a good average seat factor would be critical to sustain such 
operations. ‘Wait and watch’ remains the theme. – <b>Vision</b><br>

        <li>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: -20px">
        <font face="Verdana" size="1">Efforts to promote tourism and healthy economic activities in the country have 
augmented growth in the sector. Along with the increase in traffic volumes and a 
healthy seat utilisation, average yields have also improved, boosting airline 
revenues. The company is in forefront for aviation services in Oman. During 
2006, Oman Air flew more than 1.2 million passengers. In Airport Services 
business, it handled 23,545 flights and 4.521 million passengers at Seeb 
airport. We expect the traffic to remain robust during this year. The government 
too has plans to raise its holding from 34 per cent to 81 per cent, with 
infusion of over RO50 Million. This will help the company in its expansion 
plans. Meanwhile, plans to acquire five new Airbus aircraft as part of an 
ambitious expansion strategy along with restructuring and re-branding, will 
augment the company’s performance in the long term. However near term, capacity 
expansion will have a negative effect on earnings. Investors may stay away until 
the new capacity
comes into play. – <b>GIS</b></font></li>

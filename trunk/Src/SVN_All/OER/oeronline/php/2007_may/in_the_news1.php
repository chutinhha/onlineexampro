<b>Smart Manufacturing conference was an exceptional networking and knowledge 
transfer event granting manufacturers a chance to enhance their bottom line. An 
OER report on the recent two-day event<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="special5.jpg" width="150" height="190" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Assisting manufacturers fiscally is an ardent issue, which business and financial 
institutions are now attempting to discover. Bringing this to the forefront was 
the recently held Public Establishment for Industrial Estates’ (PEIE) annual 
Smart Manufacturing Conference. The two-day meeting was supported by GroFin 
Oman, NBO, Ociped and the Gulf Organisation for Industrial Consulting. <br>
<br>
Speakers at the conference opined that Oman needs a vibrant and successful 
manufacturing sector and companies needed to improve continually, update 
technology and skills to be competitive and that meant investing in equipment 
and in staff, using the right mix of finance. The situation in Oman may not be 
directly comparable to the situation faced by small and medium-sized 
manufacturers in other parts of the world. However, the theme of accessing 
finance at a fair rate is common to manufacturers the world over. “Internet and 
the way global supply chains now work means manufacturers of all sizes have 
international opportunities, but access to the right type of finance is needed 
to help these firms grow,” said Mohammed Al Maskari, director-general, Knowledge 
Oasis Muscat.<br>
<br>
<b>Business development<br>
</b>It is in this direction that one of the most exciting developments in financing 
Oman-based SMEs has taken place–the launch of GroFin Oman, a business 
development and financing company. GroFin Oman is the Fund Manager of Intilaaqah 
Enterprise Fund, an initiative by Shell, representing a contribution of $10 
million to the Sultanate to assist in the development of SMEs. Abeer Al 
Abduwani, GroFin’s country director, said: “Our mission is to generate returns 
for our investors, shareholders and employees and to create sustainable wealth, 
employment, economic growth and social development in the Sultanate. We’ll 
realise this mission by providing vital business development assistance and 
appropriate finance to sustainable SMEs.” Smart Manufacturing endeavours to 
bring together the various elements of Oman’s manufacturing cooperation. The 
success of this conference spoke in itself, as it attracted more than 200 
delegates from around the world, which included managing directors, financial 
controllers, marketers, sales, training and IT managers.<br>
<br>
Among the other things, one aspect that came to the fore at the conference was 
how is Oman placed on the global arena. David Crickmore, CEO of Amouage, stated, 
“local products need further awareness and there should be a drive to produce 
goods that are internationally applicable and engaging. Oman has richness from 
which to source, but it needs to be correctly focused and developed.” He 
believed that greater emphasis must be focused to understand the consumer 
mindset and market trends, and one must recognise that the international 
consumer is always changing.<br>
<br>
<b>Knowledge transfer</b><br>
Smart Manufacturing is an exceptional networking and knowledge transfer event 
that is sincerely believed to benefit all those involved, granting manufacturers 
the chance to enhance their bottomline. The conference showcased international 
speakers, including Professor Mike Gregory, Cambridge University’s leading 
expert on manufacturing; Dr Ahmed Al Mutawa, GOIC’s secretary-general; the 
international design specialist, David Crickmore from Amouage; Anwar Al Asmi, 
Oman’s leading young film maker; Abeer Al Abduwani, country manager for the 
newly-launched SME Business Fund, GroFin Oman; and Mark Hobbs, a leading 
Gulf-based HR and training expert.<br>

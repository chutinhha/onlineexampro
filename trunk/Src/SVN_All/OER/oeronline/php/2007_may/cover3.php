Banking on a boom</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>BankMuscat is the third company that has managed to retain its last year’s 
position. Here is why it is still the No. 1 bank in Oman<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover_3b.jpg" width="175" height="220" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">BankMuscat enjoyed a market share of 42 per cent in terms of total assets, 41.4 
per cent in terms of total credit and 39.2 per cent in terms of total customer 
deposits as on December 31, 2006. Similarly, the bank’s share of total savings 
deposits was 41.1 per cent.<br>
<br>
While the bank continued on its path of measured growth during the year gone by, 
several measures have been initiated by it to prepare it for sustained growth in 
the future. The most significant amongst these was the bank’s decision to 
implement the recommendations of global strategy firm, Booz Allen Hamilton, on 
the re-organisation of the bank in line with emerging customer segments. This 
also resulted in a number of senior management changes. Also noteworthy was the 
bank’s decision to select and implement a new core banking system (CBS), 
replacing the existing MIE system. Assisted by Gartner Consulting, the bank 
evaluated three leading CBS solutions before selecting Temenos T24 as the best 
fit for its business model. The implementation project is expected to be 
complete by March 2008.<br>
<br>
During the year, the bank’s corporate banking group has had a stimulating and 
eventful year. It was not only associated with the financial closure of two 
large petrochemical projects – Aromatics Oman in Sohar and Octal Petrochemicals 
in Salalah – as the mandated lead Arranger, but has also undertaken four major 
re-financing programmes. Of these, two were in the oil and gas sector, one for a 
power and water project and another for an LNG tanker. Besides, BankMuscat has 
upgraded its existing small business unit into a full-scale department (SME 
credit and marketing) with dedicated staff to look after the financial needs of 
the SME sector. The International Finance Corporation has also signed a 
technical agreement with the bank to help it promote the SME finance segment in 
the Sultanate.<br>
<br>
The bank’s corporate finance and advisory (CFA) unit continued its progress 
during the year by successfully making an entry into the global advisory league 
tables. The unit played a pivotal role in the bank’s acquisition of a 43 per 
cent stake in the Mangal Keshav Holding (MKH) in India, one of the top 20 
security houses in India. The CFA unit also successfully completed the US$ 147 
million petrochemical project (Phase I), the first project in the Salalah Free 
Zone.<br>
<br>
The bank’s brokerage unit also had a very successful year, becoming the number 
one brokerage house in the country, with a 19 per cent market share. All the 
major segments of the bank’s treasury and capital markets – foreign exchange, 
money markets and structured products – witnessed strong business growth during 
the year. The bank also became the first bank in the Sultanate of Oman to be 
granted approval for offering commodity-hedging products to local corporations. 
The focus on money market activities increased the treasury division’s balance 
sheet size by over 60 per cent.<br>
<br>
On the international operations front, the bank’s subsidiary in Bahrain, 
BankMuscat International (BMI), continued to turn in robust performances during 
the year and received ‘investment grade’ ratings from Standard &amp; Poors, Moody’s 
and Capital Intelligence at the beginning of 2006. BankMuscat’s Representative 
Office in Dubai accelerated its business development initiatives amongst the 
non-resident Indian community during 2006 by capitalising on the expertise and 
support of Centurion Bank of Punjab, its partner from India. BankMuscat’s 
largest international investment is its 21.95 per cent stake in Centurion Bank 
of Punjab, where it is also largest shareholder.<br>
<br>
The bank’s performance were once again recognised and lauded by financial 
community during the year. Notable amongst the awards and recognitions during 
2006 were Best Bank in Oman award for the 5th time by Euromoney; Best Bank, Oman 
(6th year running), Best Forex Bank and Provider, Oman (3rd year running), Best 
Trade Finance Bank and Provider, Oman (3rd year running), Best Internet Consumer 
Bank, Oman (3rd year running) by Global Finance; Deals of the Year, Oman by The 
Banker FT London; Banking &amp; Finance CEO of the Year by Datamatix; and maiden 
entry into global league tables (mandates won) for
financial advisors.<br>
<br>
In an attempt to support the efforts made the by the Ministry of Social 
Development and the Central Bank of Oman to enhance the welfare of our society 
and promote long-term growth of the national economy, the Bank also launched a 
significant social awareness campaign during the year to address the dangers of 
excessive personal borrowing.<br>
<br>
Hinging on the philosophy that one needs to ‘borrow sensibly, to live happily’, 
the campaign was intended to recognize responsible consumer lending as a key 
value and crucial growth engine for our society. This is the first such 
programme to be endorsed by the Ministry of Social Development and the Central 
Bank of Oman.</font></p>

Outlook</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
The year ahead looks poised with promise: the promise of reaching greater 
heights, riding on the back of an even stronger performance in 2006; a local 
economy that is showing definite signs of being on the move; higher domestic 
consumption trends; greater prospects of geo-political stability across the 
region and continued strong global energy prices, all of which augur well for 
the bank, according to the company’s annual report.<br>
<br>
The bank shall also continue to foray into and emphasise the importance of 
fee-based and commission-based value-added services, which today contribute 
significantly to the bottomline. To this end, the bank will continue its 
pioneering initiatives that cut through the clutter and command a distinct 
premium. It is only by achieving an ideal balance between its various revenue 
streams and by moving even closer to the customer with relevant products and 
superior services that the bank can strive to become future proof.<br>
<br>
However, competition is expected to considerably increase in the domestic market 
during 2007. Resurgent local players, the influx of three strong regional banks, 
and the incorporation of a new bank in Oman are all expected to keep BankMuscat 
on<br>
its toes.</font></p>

Having around 40 per cent share in the local market, BankMuscat clearly benefits 
from the current economic expansion. Assuming a loan growth of 20 per cent and 
non-interest income growth of 25 per cent for the current year, we estimate an 
EPS of RO0.091 in 2007 for BankMuscat. The book value is estimated to be at 
RO0.511 by the end of 2007. The current market price discounts the EPS estimate 
by 12.7 times and the book value by 2.3 times. Given our estimated earnings 
growth of around 25 per cent, valuations appear on the lower side for the stock 
at current levels if one considers this stock for a longer investment horizon. –

BankMuscat, the banking leader in the country, is blessed by robust economic 
growth adding strength to credit off takes. The Bank witnessed commendable 
growth of 31.8 per cent in gross loan books to RO1.953 billion during 2006 – a 
market share of more than 40 per cent. Credit demand is expected to remain 
robust during the current year. Although rise in interest rates is likely to 
keep pressure on spreads in the short term, the bank has been in the forefront 
to gather low-cost savings and current accounts. Also, focus from the bank on 
its fee and commission-based income is expected to benefit the Bank. The year is 
bound to see higher contributions from its overseas operations too. We expect 
the Bank to register an EPS of 80 baiza for FY 2007, which is 14.3X its current 
market price of RO1.145. – <b>GIS</b></font></li>

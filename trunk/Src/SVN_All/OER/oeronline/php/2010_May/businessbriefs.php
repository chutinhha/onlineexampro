					Oman Mobile numbers at a fixed price. Customers can now 
					speak for as long as they want for a flat rate per call of

					Infinity price plan enables subscribers to enjoy unlimited 
					telephone calls, SMS, MMS, and video calls to other Omantel 
					and Oman Mobile numbers; and up to 3GB of 3.5G mobile 
					broadband for the fixed price of RO39 per month. An 
					additional benefit for subscribers will be a reduction in 
					the SIM card price for Mada from RO7 to RO2 and the removal 
					of the RO3 connection fee that used to apply for Mada 
					products. Introducing “pay per call” instead of “pay per

					freedom to speak to friends and relatives across the country 
					with the peace of mind of knowing they pay the same price 
					for the call if it is just for one minute or for an hour or

				held on March 31, 2010 brought to light the landmark year that 
				2009 was a year when Oman Air repositioned itself from being a 
				regional carrier to a truly international airline.<br>
				<br>
				HE Ahmed Bin Abdulnabi Macki, minister of National Economy, 
				deputy chairman of Financial Affairs &amp; Energy Resources Council 
				and the chairman of Oman Air Board, announced that the 
				authorised capital of Oman Air has been increased from RO300mn 
				to RO500mn. “We are confident that over a period of time when 
				the airline has established its presence in the industry and its 
				network has matured, we will see positive returns on 
				investment,” Macki said. “As per the recent data released by 
				IATA, 2009 was one of the most difficult years for the airline 
				industry in which the airlines collectively lost in excess of 
				$11 bn. Globally passenger travel contracted by 3.5 per cent 
				while cargo movement declined steeply by 10.1 per cent. The 
				industry is expected to show improved results in 2010 as 
				passenger travel is picking up especially in the premium cabins. 
				It will however take time for the business to return to the 
				levels seen before the economic crisis. Financial results of 
				Oman Air too were impacted by adverse economic conditions. Going 
				forward Oman Air will commence flights to Kuala Lumpur, 
				Kathmandu, Dar-Es-Salaam, Islamabad, Lahore, Ras Al Khaima, and 
				Al Ain in the summer schedule of 2010, with Milan joining the 
				network in the Winter Schedule,” the minister added.</font><br>

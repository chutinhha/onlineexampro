					</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Disgraced golfer Tiger 
					Woods returned to his professional golfing career at the 
					Masters golf tournament in Augusta (Georgia)on April 8, 
					2010. Anticipation had been ripe about the troubled golfer’s 
					comeback in competitive golf, as he made a triumphant return 
					to his professional career.<br>
					<br>
					</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
					<img border="0" src="images/Golf_New_Logo.jpg" width="100" height="247" vspace="4" hspace="9" align="right"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
					fans of the ace golfer could not have asked for more as the 
					play that the World No.1 golfer displayed was something that 
					can be best described as stunning as the golfer delivered a 
					four-under 68. The feat achieved by Woods was indeed special 
					as this was the first time in his sixteen appearances at the 
					Masters tournament that he was able to break 70 in the first 
					round of the competition. Moreover, the champion golfer also 
					managed to include in his round two eagles, which was 
					another record that he achieved at the Masters golf 
					tournament 2010. The amazing feat showcased by Woods in his 
					comeback game enabled him to finish just two strokes behind 
					Fred Couples. Although the troubled golfer might have been a 
					bit perturbed about the kind of reception that he would be 
					receiving from the crowds, the boisterous applause and 
					unending cheers from the golf fans must have given him the 
					boost that he required.<br>
					<br>
					Woods later added that the reception that he received by the 
					crowd at the Masters golf tournament 2010 was something that 
					was almost unbelievable as he had never heard the crowd 
					cheer so loudly for him at the venue. Woods’ ease in the 
					golf course at the Masters golf tournament 2010 highlighted 
					his dominance over the game despite the problems confronting 
					his personal life. <br>
					<br>
					<b>In limbo </b><br>
					The world number one’s last tournament appearance was on 
					November 15, 2009 – when he won the Australian Masters. Less 
					than a fortnight later he crashed his car outside his 
					Florida home, an incident that led to revelations about his 
					private life and a break from golf. “As a professional, I 
					think Augusta’s where I need to be, even though it’s a while 
					since I last played,” he said earlier. Following the storm 
					of publicity about his personal conduct at the end of last 
					year, Woods made his first public appearance in February to 
					apologise for his actions. The 34-year-old revealed he had 
					been having ongoing therapy for his extra-marital affairs, 
					but added he did not yet know when he would be ready to 
					return to competitive golf. <br>
					<br>
					Woods’s decision to return to playing will see him resume 
					one of the greatest careers in golfing history. <br>
					<br>
					The American is third in the all-time PGA tour rankings in 
					terms of career victories, with only Sam Snead (83) and Jack 
					Nicklaus (73) having done better than his 71 successes. And 
					he ranks second behind Nicklaus’s record of 18 major titles. 
					Woods has twice come into a major after a long lay-off, with 
					mixed results – he missed the cut in the 2006 US Open at 
					Winged Foot after his father died, and he won the 2008 US 
					Open at Torrey Pines while playing on a seriously injured 
					left knee. Following the Masters, the US Open in June is at 
					Pebble Beach, where Woods won by a major record 15 shots in 
					2000, while the Open in July returns to the Old Course at St 
					Andrews where he won by eight strokes 10 years ago and by 
					five in 2005.

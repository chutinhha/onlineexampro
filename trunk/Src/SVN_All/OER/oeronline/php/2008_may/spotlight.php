<b>A comprehensive guide on air-conditioners and refrigerators including design 
and style trends to help you weather the swelter<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="spotlight_1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="182">As 
temperatures soar and the mercury rises, air-conditioners become a hot household 
priority. While globally the air-conditioning and refrigerator market is growing 
by leaps and bounds, in countries such as the Middle East the segment has 
witnessed enormous growth. In the GCC for instance, massive construction drives 
spurring the development of numerous residential and commercial real estate 
projects and high population growth have fuelled demand for air-conditioners and 
cooling systems. <br>
<br>
The boom in real estate development together with the growing emphasis on 
greater cooling facilities and the resultant increase in power demand have all 
contributed to creating huge opportunities for manufactures and distributors in 
district cooling. This trend has received added impetus in recent years with the 
lack of sufficient generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure to 
meet projected power demands.<br>
<br>
The Middle East has been a major market for air-conditioners, coolants and 
refrigerators, chiefly due to the region’s arid climatic conditions. However, in 
recent times, other factors have been reinforcing the market’s growth in the 
segment. These include improvements in lifestyle, the mushrooming of numerous 
malls and hypermarkets all over the region and other developmental activities, 
all of which has spurred demand for air-conditioning products.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="spotlight_2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="100" height="69">“Air conditioners have come a long way from being just a cooling machine. Today 
we have models that can detect and eliminate deadly disease causing agents like 
SARS and bird-flu virus and other harmful pathogens this is done through a 
technology called MPI [Micro Plasma Ion], a world’s first from SAMSUNG,” says 
Ajay Ganti, General Manager, SARCO distributors for SAMSUNG in Oman.<br>
<br>
He goes on to add that newer models of air-conditioners “incorporate what is 
called GOOD SLEEP MODE, which senses your body temperature to regulate the room 
temperature. There is a lot of focus on hygiene and health. There is also a lot 
of impetus on the design accent to turn the air-conditioner into a piece of art, 
to make it a part of your interior decor. So basically, the AC is a lifestyle 
product rather than just a cooling product”.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="spotlight_3.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="66">In Oman, the air-conditioner and refrigerator market account for a whopping 65 
to 70 per cent of all business in the white goods market. “The market size of 
air-conditioning products is around 200 K units a year in Oman. The market size 
for Refrigerators is around 80 K units a year. Also due to a very fertile 
commercial / industrial projects scenario,there is also a great business 
opportunity for different air-conditioning concepts like chiller, ducted type or 
DVM(digital Variable Multi),” says Ganti. Traditionally, the Sultanate has been 
a market for window ACs. That trend is rapidly changing as improved standards of 
living and more sophisticated lifestyles push customer preference to split and 
ducted air-conditioners. This is in line with global trends. Apart from 
lifestyle changes and economic development, price reductions in split units have 
driven demand for these models of air-conditioners. What’s more, the 
air-conditioner which was earlier regarded as a seasonal product now boasts 
decent sales figures even during off-season. <br>
<br>
In Oman extreme temperatures and high levels of humidity have spurred the demand 
for high quality, energy efficient, environment friendly and reliable cooling 
solutions. The Omani government, in keeping with these trends and demands, has 
established the highest standards in setting requirements for all new projects 
being developed for both the tourism and real estate sectors.<br>
<br>
In order to meet these requirements and to reduce the demand on the governments 
for energy the District Cooling solution has been developed and implemented 
throughout the GCC.<br>
<br>
District Cooling is highly reliable, energy efficient and a cost saving 
solution. It achieves economies of scale through the use of a centralized plant, 
rather than individual chillers in each building. The high technology operating 
plants use energy efficient water cooled chillers that reduce the demand for 
electric power by 50 per cent, while reducing individual building electrical 
power requirements by 70 per cent. This reduction in power demand combined with 
the use of environmental friendly refrigerants makes the world a cleaner, safer 
place to live by reducing carbon emissions and ozone depleting emissions.<br>
<br>
Apart from robust growth in the real estate sector, the other trends emerging in 
the region are the growing demand for closed controlled units and, as mentioned, 
the increasing preference for split air-conditioners.<br>
<br>
In addition, manufacturers, globally are compelled to adopt changes in 
technology in order to comply with new environmental regulations. These changes 
in technology and A/C mechanics involve components, architecture and 
refrigerants for vapour-compression cycles and non-vapour-compression cycle 
refrigeration. When it comes to the Middle East, the increasing effects of 
global warming on the region have led to the development of e-ion air 
purification systems such as that of Panasonic’s air-conditioners, which make 
the units highly efficient even at extreme temperatures of 55 degrees C.<br>
<br>
The Middle East supply structure for air-conditioners and refrigerators is so 
intensely competitive and complex that it allows sufficient room for major 
producers, brands and importers who are all scrambling for a piece of the pie 
from this lucrative market. From what brand distributors say, sales have only 
been going up and how. For instance last year, Panasonic witnessed 
air-conditioner sales increase by 165 per cent in Oman which is among the 
highest in the region; while the GCC saw a total sales increase of 124 per cent 
giving them a 12 per cent share of the total GCC air-conditioning market.<br>
<br>
<b>Refrigerators</b><br>
As far as refrigerators are concerned the scenario seems to be no different. “In 
case of refrigerators, Oman is slowly turning around. We are already selling a 
large number of single door and Top-mounted freezer type double-door 
refrigerators. But due to the transforming socio-economic scenario in the 
Sultanate, we are also selling a considerable number of our double-door 
refrigerators with twin-cooling technology as discussed earlier,” says Ganti.<br>
<br>
Trends show the product rapidly emerging from a mere utility based item to a 
luxury and lifestyle product where the emphasis ranges from styling, storage 
space, size and the like. Leading brands are now concentrating on technological 
innovations with these parameters in mind and are introducing products with 
microprocessor-based controls to reduce energy consumption. New products in the 
category also come implementing technologies such as insulating materials along 
with distinctive features such as plasma filters and deodorisers. “As for the 
refrigerators, they have come a long way from being just gadgets to “keep food 
cold”. The trend is moving towards refrigerators that not only revolutionise the 
way you store food, but also how you organise your kitchen and your life,” <br>
says Ganti.<br>
<br>
When it comes to technology, manufacturers worldwide are incorporating 
technologies that have less of an adverse impact on the environment. Substitute 
refrigerants such as carbon dioxide that do not destroy the ozone layer or 
trigger global warming are now being used.<br>
<br>
<b>Understanding industry jargon</b><br>
You may have heard of terms like BTU, tonne, etc., when you talk about ACs, but 
do not know what they mean? Get to know industry jargon that will help you 
select an AC or refrigeration product that best meets your needs<br>
<br>
<b>What size air conditioner do I need?</b><br>
The cooling capacity of an air conditioner is measured in British Thermal Units 
(BTU) and the capacity you require depends mostly on the size of the room you 
need to cool. If you buy an air conditioner that is too small, it will not cool 
adequately. If you buy one that is too large, the air conditioner will cool the 
room before it dehumidifies and this can leave you feeling clammy. For larger 
areas, sometimes, two smaller units are more efficient than one large unit. Your 
dealer will have additional details.<br>
<br>
<b>How often should I clean the filter?</b><br>
To ensure maximum cooling capacity and efficiency, you should keep the filter 
clean. During peak usage times, the filter should be inspected on a weekly basis 
to make sure that it is not clogged with dust.<br>
<br>
<b>What does EER mean?</b><br>
The EER, or Energy-Efficiency Rating, measures an air conditioner’s energy 
consumption and efficiency. A higher EER rating means that your AC is consuming 
less energy.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the tonnage in ACs?</b><br>
The unit of measure used in air conditioning to describe the cooling capacity of 
a system. One ton of cooling is based on the amount of heat needed to melt one 
ton (2000 lbs) of ice in a 24 hour period. One ton of cooling is equal to 12,000 
Btu/hr.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Getting the best from your A/C</b><br>
Increase the life and improve the efficiency of your air-conditioner with these 
few handy tips. Also see how you can make you A/C more energy efficient so that 
it doesn’t run up huge electricity bills each month.<br>
<br>
The maintenance of an AC is an area that most consumers and commercial clients 
need to learn about. It is not always necessary to order dealer service when a 
little bit of care and maintenance on your part will go a long way in improving 
the working life of your air conditioner.Simple things such as regular cleaning 
of the filters, helps increase the life of your AC. However, it is more prudent 
for you to enter into an annual maintenance contract with the authorised service 
centre of your brand of AC, so that the units are maintained at a nominal cost 
with little hassle. The following few tips will help one maintain an 
air-conditioner in an easy simple way:<br>
<br>
Understand that an air conditioner, apart from cooling, also conditions the air 
inside your room like humidity, dust, order, fungus, bacteria, etc. All good 
quality ACs have cooling, humidity control, dust removal, anti fungal and 
anti-bacterial functions and these need to be used properly.<br>
<br>
Split ACs are now affordable, very quiet and energy saving as compared to window 
ACs. They are also more hygienic and prevent birds from making their nests in 
air gaps, rodents creeping in and air from leaking.<br>
<br>
Clean the filter of your AC once a fortnight, or when the indicator lamp on the 
front panel lights up. Dirty air filters force your system to work harder to 
push cool air through your home. This uses more energy and places extra strain 
on the air conditioning system. Take the filter(s) out and hold it to the light. 
If the dust on the filter is so think that you can’t see much light shining 
through the filter, it’s time for new filters. A clean air filter, unobstructed 
by the dirt and other debris, will save you money on energy costs and prolong 
the life of your air conditioner. If you do not know where your air filters are 
or how to replace them, ask your HVAC technician to show you during an 
inspection.<br>
<br>
Keep the doors of your rooms open for a few minutes every day to allow some 
fresh air to enter.<br>
<br>
Do not spray any type of deodorant or perfume into your split ACs. Doing so will 
result in foul smell, necessitating a cleaning of the indoor unit.<br>
<br>
Avoid smoking in an AC room as indirect smoke can harm other family members and 
it is very difficult to remove the odour even by servicing.<br>
<br>
For safety, always turn the thermostat and outdoor unit's breaker off before 
doing any work around that outdoor unit. The coil can be cleaned using a 
soft-bristle brush to gently sweep the fins. Always brush in line with the fins, 
and be gentle because the fins can bend easily. Because the fan pulls air 
through these fins, you can expect to find dust clinging to the fins. Removing 
this dust and other debris will reduce resistance and increase efficiency.<br>
<br>
If you smell bad odour, it normally will not be from your AC but from your 
carpet, curtains, linen, excessive sweat, etc. However, if the filter is not 
cleaned routinely or the drainage is clogged and water remains in the drain pan 
for long, it can cause foul smell. Here, it is essential that the drainpipe be 
connected properly to prevent foul smell from entering through the pipe.<br>
<br>
Keep the exhaust fan of your bathrooms ON when you are at home.<br>
<br>
Keep the split AC ON even when you are out of home at a temperature of 27 degree 
C. This will keep your home cool and healthy, especially when the outside 
temperature is above 42 degree C, with high humidity. A good quality AC is meant 
to be ON 24 hours a day.<br>
<br>
In Oman today, an AC is needed for not more than seven months a year. Using the 
AC when indoor temperature is less than 25 degree C is a waste of energy. 
Between November and March, do not switch ON the AC in fan mode, instead use a 
ceiling fan that will give you comfortable and natural sleep.<br>
<br>
When the outside temperature goes above 42 degree C, keep the bedroom and living 
room ACs ON at a temperature setting of 27 degree C even if you are out of the 
room. This will prevent the room walls and roof from becoming excessively hot. 
Hot walls and roof lead to continuous running of the AC’s compressor, resulting 
in excessive power consumption and inefficient cooling. When you re-enter the 
room, you can adjust the temperature settings. Your electricity bills will not 
be high as the compressor will shut down on reaching the set temperature. At 
such times, the AC can be turned off after 10 PM as the room temperature will 
remain at around 25 degree C and a ceiling fan running at slow speed will give 
you comfortable sleep.<br>
<br>
If you own a villa, plant trees around the building, as these can help you save 
on your electricity bills.<br>
<br>
Insulate your rooftop professionally and use good quality insulated bricks for 
the walls. Use thick curtains so that the heat rays do not enter the house / 
flat.<br>
<br>
Keep the outdoor unit of your split air conditioner in a shaded area or place it 
in such a way that afternoon sunlight does not hit it directly. <br>
<br>
Get the AC checked and serviced by your distributor once a year for any gas leak 
and get the outdoor unit washed using high pressure water. This will help you 
save on your electricity bills.<br>
<br>
Cleaning the filter every fortnight is very important to save energy. Users 
themselves can do filter cleaning and use service centres for other routine 
services.<br>
<br>
Try to select energy-efficient ACs.<br>
<br>
Electricity bill of a three-bedroom villa or apartment with five occupants under 
above conditions will not exceed RO45 per month in peak summer, even as one 
stays fresh and comfortable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Global trends in refrigerators<br>
From boring, ‘boxy’ applicances whose primary funtion was food and beverage 
storage, refrigerators today are sleek gadgets that offer numerous value-added 
features<br>
<br>
With globalization and modernization trends in refrigerators have gone from 
functional and utility-based to trendy swank-chic with a health focus. A 
refrigerator is no more a repository for food – it doubles as multi-purpose 
storage facility, ice and water dispenser, filter and is often part of the 
interior décor of any modern home. The advent of side-by-side door and 
French-door refrigerators from top brands now afford sleekness of design, more 
energy efficiency, roomy storage space, better cooling capacity and easy and 
adjustable access to items.<br>
<br>
Top Mount<br>
Among the most popular in conventional model refrigerators is the top-mount 
model where the freezer compartment is on the top and the refrigerator part at 
the bottom. One of the reasons why it’s so popular in households world-over is 
because it offers a fair amount of storage and is generally more energy 
efficient. Model widths range from about 24 to 36 inches with capacities from 10 
to 25 cubic feet. It does have a few drawbacks through, the chief among them 
being that some times retrieving items from the fresh foods section can be 
awkward and difficult, and the wide door swing may impede traffic aisles making 
passage awkward. Also not many top-mount refrigerator models come with an 
external water-dispensing system save for a few models from brands such as GE. 
One of the brand’s models, the GE Profile CustomStyle 21-cubic-foot model is 
equipped with what the company calls ‘the tall Light Touch dispenser’, which 
provides through-the-door filtered water and crushed or cubed ice, and can 
accommodate a tall sports bottle. This upscale model fits flush with standard 
cabinets to give it a built-in look. Other features include two 
humidity-adjustable crispers, three split adjustable spill-proof glass shelves, 
and a temperature-adjustable meat pan.<br>
<br>
Bottom Mount<br>
A bottom-mount refrigerator is one where the freezer compartment is at the 
bottom and the refrigerator part on the top. These models are usually more 
expensive but it offers better reach and easy access to the fresh foods section, 
which is at eye level in most models. Its pullout freezer is convenient, as 
well, although on some models, you may have to bend to reach items in the back 
of the drawer. As with the top-mount refrigerator model, the wide door swing 
here too can be a problem, as can the pullout drawer when it’s open, so plan 
accordingly. And like top-mount models, these models don’t usually offer a water 
or ice dispenser. However, LG’s recently introduced model LRDC22744, with 22.4 
cubic feet is available with an external filtered-water dispenser.<br>
<br>
Similarly, Maytag’s 25-cubic-foot model MBF2558H has one of the largest bottom 
freezers available. Other features include a glide-out freezer door with a wire 
drawer and basket. The fresh foods section has rollers for its glide-out shelves 
and an elevator shelf makes appropriate adjustments for tall storage.Drawers 
include humidity-controlled crispers and a wide deli drawer. Gallon-plus door 
bins can accommodate two-liter bottles.<br>
<br>
A chiller that keeps milk extra cold, and a Chef’s Pantry drawer with dividers 
for meats and cheeses, plus two humidity-controlled crispers, and four clear 
adjustable door buckets are additional features. There is also an internal 
filtered water dispenser.<br>
<br>
Side-By-Side<br>
A side-by-side refrigerator opens in the middle with the freezer on the left and 
the fresh foods section on the right. It offers comparatively more freezer 
capacity than a bottom- or top-mount unit, but most will not easily accommodate 
oversize items such as large turkeys, large frozen pizzas, sheet cakes, or large 
platters of food. However, side-by-side refrigerators are far from small; they 
measure 30- to 36-inches wide, with anywhere from 20 to 30 cubic feet of space. 
And, the narrow doors don’t intrude into the traffic aisles, so they can be 
placed opposite an island or used in galley kitchens.<br>
<br>
An example a large side-by-side model is Kenmore’s 20-cubic-foot model 54032, 
which has a through-the-door filtered water and ice dispenser, adjustable glass 
shelves, gallon and liter storage, humidity-controlled crispers for meat and 
vegetables, three adjustable and one fixed door bin, and upfront electronic 
controls. Frigidaire offers a pizza shelf and an ice cream shelf in the freezer 
compartment of its 26-cubic-foot side-by-side model GLHS269ZD. In addition, the 
refrigerator section has fixed and adjustable shelves, canned drinks and wine 
racks, a divided crisper, and a filtered water and ice external dispenser. It 
comes in white, bisque, or black.<br>
<br>
Humongous 36-, 42- and 48-cubic-foot built-in side-by-side refrigerators do a 
better job of storing oversize items, if you can give up or afford sufficient 
floor space to accommodate one. Thermador’s Professional series model KBUIT4860A 
is a titanic 48 cubic feet. It features frameless glass shelves, integrated 
gallon door storage, roller glides on drawers, and humidity-sealed crispers. In 
the freezer section, there is an ice maker with a portable, removable ice 
bucket.<br>
<br>
King-size refrigerators have been traditionally sold in the luxury market 
(Sub-Zero and Viking, in addition to Thermador), but most mainstream 
manufacturers, such as GE, KitchenAid, and Jenn-Air now make them for their 
upscale series of appliances. For example, Jenn-Air model JS42CSFXDA is a 
42-cubic-foot, built-in refrigerator that accepts custom panels and hardware to 
match your kitchen’s cabinetry. The freezer has two handy tilt-out baskets, two 
door baskets, and adjustable wire shelves for customising freezer space. The 
automatic ice maker and storage drawer are easy to access. In the refrigerator 
section, you have your choice of optional bins and compartments and climate 
zones to personalize fresh-foods storage. Shelves roll out and can be moved up 
or down via a crank system.<br>
<br>
French Door<br>
The French door refrigerator, the newest trend in refrigerators, is a 
combination of the side-by-side and bottom-mount styles, and it offers the best 
features of both. Twin doors open in the middle to access the fresh foods 
section, and a freezer drawer across the bottom of the unit tilts open for easy 
access. These refrigerators are typically about 36-inches wide, and come with 
capacities that range between 20 and 25 cubic feet. Several manufacturers make 
them, including Amana, Maytag, JennAir, LG, and Kenmore. Prices verify from 
moderately priced ones to the more upper-end models depending on features and 
finish. For instance, Jenn-Air’s French Door Pro Style 20 cubic-foot model is 
cabinet depth and has upfront electronic temperature controls for sleek styling. 
Individual sensors maintain a consistent temperature in each compartment. It is 
offered with an internal filtered water dispenser.<br>
<br>
Amana’s 24.4 cubic-foot French Door refrigerator also comes with upfront touch 
pad controls, as well as an “easy fill” internal water dispenser, and ice 
dispenser, and an ice bucket. Four half Spillsaver glass shelves provide 
convenient storage space.<br>
<br>
To date, only Kenmore offers an optional external water dispenser with its 21- 
and 25-cubic-foot Elite Trio French Door refrigerators.<br>
<br>
More Features<br>
With today’s busy households and hectic career schedules, convenience is key, so 
the current range of refrigerators offer more flexible storage, and capacity 
that is adjustable and easy to see and access. In the fresh foods section of 
some refrigerators, for example, see-through drawers let you check on stored 
items with a glance. “Elevator” shelves that can be adjusted up or down 
effortlessly let you make room for different types of groceries and containers 
as needs change. Another practical feature is LG’s “Design-A-Door Shelving 
System,” which is available on their top- and bottom-mount refrigerators, such 
as model Model LRTVN22310 (22 cubic feet) has a shelf that can move vertically 
and horizontally so that you can store a large platter of food. For real 
convenience, it also can be operated with a crank so that you don’t have to 
remove items before you move the shelves. The refrigerator also has slide-out 
spill-proof shelves that make it easy to reach items and clean in the back, 
shelf snuggers, or sliding brackets, that help to secure containers that are in 
the door panel, and door-mounted ice dispensers that free up valuable storage 
space in the freezer.<br>
<br>
Whirlpool’s Conquest model GS6SHAXM 25-cubic-foot side-by-side has a door-mount 
dispenser that can be lifted out and used as an ice bucket. In the freezer, look 
for handy tilt-out and roll-out shelves, deep slide-out baskets for frozen 
vegetables and entrees, and upper baskets for frequently used items. Electronic 
touch-pad controls and digital displays have replaced knobs and dials in most 
models.<br>
<br>
Filtered water is a popular amenity, especially as consumers are becoming more 
health conscious. Recently, Sears announced that Kenmore and Kenmore Elite 
refrigerators now come with a PUR Ultimate filter. Sears says that these 
refrigerators remove more contaminants than any other model on the market. With 
few exceptions, external water dispensers come only with side-by-side 
refrigerators. But many other models have filtered water and ice dispensers on 
the inside.<br>
<br>
In other models, KitchenAid’s KSRJ22CNST 21.7 cubic-foot refrigerator has the 
AquaSense “lifelong” 500-gallon water filtration system with an indicator light 
that denotes the status of the filter. The model’s OptimIce technology makes ice 
50-percent faster than the standard model. Whirlpool’s Wide-by-Side 
26-cubic-foot model M2D2667H features the PuriClean filter system with a light 
that goes on to remind you to change the filter. This extra-wide 36-inch 
refrigerator also has elevator shelves. And because noise can be a concern in 
today’s kitchen, which may be part of an open plan where the family watches TV 
or even studies, both of these refrigerators boast quiet operation. In fact, 
most manufacturers have made improvements on compressors and motors that not 
only make their refrigerators more energy efficient, but do so quietly.<br>
<br>
Is your refrigerator running away with your wallet?<br>
<br>
Refrigerators just seem to keep running forever. And, except for the occasional 
purge of suspect containers and produce from its interior, they don’t need much 
looking after. Or, do they? Some experts see refrigerators as the 
‘attention-deprived household applicane’ and one that can cost you big-time in 
cash if its maintenance is neglected. While it’s true that regrigerators seem to 
keep on ticking, often with little or no special care, problems with its 
functioning can and do crop up. Often, these are the result of owners’ 
negligence.<br>
<br>
What to Look For, What to Do:<br>
<br>
Here are the leading indicators that a refrigerator needs some attention, and 
some easy fixes:<br>
<br>
1) Frost accumulation of more than half an inch on the inside walls of the 
freezer. This is typical with older refrigerators that lack a self-defrosting 
feature.<br>
*Remove food; unplug your refrigerator or turn the thermostat to OFF; allow all 
frost to melt; turn it back on let it get cool; restock it with food.<br>
<br>
2) Poor cooling. This is often the result of cooling coils that are clogged with 
dust, lint and dirt.<br>
<br>
*Look for a wide, black radiator-like device (usually under the refrigerator or 
behind the lower kick-panel). To clean the coils, disconnect the refrigerator 
from the power source and use a refrigerator condenser brush. You may not be 
able to get to all of the coils from the front; it may be necessary to clean 
them from the rear of the refrigerator.<br>
<br>
3) Runs constantly. There may not be adequate clearance around the refrigerator 
for proper air flow. If your refrigerator has cooling coils on the back, make 
sure there’s at least one inch between them and the wall.<br>
<br>
*Or, there may be a bad seal on one of the doors. Look for any gaps where the 
seal meets the door, or cracks in the seal.<br>
<br>
Other things that you can do:<br>
<br>
1) Use a refrigerator vacuum cleaner attachment. This handy device makes it 
easier to thoroughly clean the condenser coils. It’s also useful for cleaning 
lint build-up in dryer.<br>
<br>
2) Use a freezer and refrigerator air cleaner. It lasts up to one year and can

The Quest for Cool: Choosing the right refrigerator<br>
<br>
If you’ve been around the market lately, you’d have noticed a wide variety of 
refrigerator models available to suit every taste and budget. Yes the 
refrigerator today is no longer the boring boxy appliance of its predecessor. 
Styles and trends take into account size, storage capacity, colour, energy 
efficiency and many more such features. That said, what is the right 
refrigerator for you? How do you decide which model best complements you home as 
well as fits your budget and the purpose? Well here are some tips to help you 
decide:<br>
<br>
Size up your needs<br>
<br>
The first step in deciding which model to choose is to first figure out how much 
space you’re going to need. For this you need to take into account the capacity 
of your current refrigerator, see how well your groceries and foodstuff fit in 
and then decide whether you want to downsize or upgrade to a larger model.<br>
<br>
The rule of thumb is to multiply the number of people in your household by five, 
and that’s the number of cubic feet you require. Multiply by six or more if you 
buy in bulk at warehouse clubs; multiply by four if you shop for produce daily.<br>
<br>
There are basically four different size refrigerators: small (7 to 9.9 cubic 
feet), medium (10 to 13.9 cubic feet), large (14 to 19.9 cubic feet), and extra 
large (20 to 30 cubic feet). A very large side-by-side model could have a 
capacity as large as 267 cubic feet, while a full size refrigerator (without a 
freezer) can run as large as 30 cubic feet. The average refrigerator provides 
between 18 and 26 cubic feet of storage space, and for an average family of 
four, 19-22 cubic feet is ideal. If you’re buying a spare or beverage 
refrigerator, a compact model under 11 cubic feet may be sufficient.<br>
<br>
Measure the area where you plan to put the refrigerator making sure to include 
height, width, and depth and always make sure you will have enough space to open 
the door. Use these measurements as a guideline when you go out for your 
purchase.<br>
<br>
Another very important consideration is whether you have an electrical outlet at 
the spot where you want to place your new refrigerator. Has plumbing been set 
up, in case you are buying a refrigerator with an ice maker or water dispenser?<br>
<br>
Once all these have been taken into consideration you’ll need to know the 
different kinds of refrigerator models before deciding which one will suit you 
best. There are basically four types: side-by-side, top mount, bottom mount, and 
counter depth.<br>
<br>
Side-by-side refrigerators as we’ve seen are exactly that – the refrigerator and 
freezer compartments stand side by side to put fresh food at eye-level. However, 
when considering a side-by-side, look carefully at the capacity and the interior 
flexibility. For some models come with narrower compartments than those in top- 
or bottom-mount models and that can be a disadvantage as you may not be able to 
accommodate larger items or packages such as bulky pizza boxes in the freezer or 
gallon-sized containers.<br>
<br>
If you do go with a side-by-side model, choose one that has adjustable bins and 
shelves so you can conform the space for your storage needs. Look for models 
that have space-saving features such as in-door ice makers that move ice to the 
freezer door and free up a lot of valuable shelf space. Most side-by-side 
refrigerators are 31 inches to 36 inches wide, with a depth between 28 inches to 
34 inches, and the height between 66 inches and 69 inches. Typically this type 
of refrigerator will require more kitchen space than other types because of the 
overall size and the area needed to open both doors. An updated version of the 
side-by-side type is the French Door model, which has two refrigerated top 
sections with a freezer on the bottom.<br>
<br>
Top-mount refrigerators are the most common type of refrigerator available, with 
the most extensive selection of styles. Because of their configuration, 
top-mounts typically offer more storage capacity than other model types. 
Eye-level freezers also offer easier access to food stored in the freezer. 
Standard widths for top-mount refrigerators range from 23 inches to 
approximately 36 inches, with a depth from 27 inches to 33 inches. Most 
top-mount refrigerators are 60 inches to 69 inches <br>
in height.<br>
<br>
Bottom-mount refrigerators are a good option if you’d rather have your 
non-frozen food section at eye-level. The dimensions of bottom-mount 
refrigerators are generally the same as those of the larger top-mounts. The 
average width is around 33 inches, the average depth ranges between 32 inches 
and 35 inches, and average height is between 66 inches and 69 inches.<br>
<br>
Counter depth refrigerators offer a built-in look but thankfully without the 
price of a built-in. These refrigerators have a more shallow profile that is 
designed to fit seamlessly into your kitchen’s décor. They fit flush with your 
countertops, giving you the built-in look.<br>
<br>
Choosing Options and Features<br>
<br>
Now that you’ve narrowed down your choice to size and type of refrigerator 
you’re almost there! Now you need to decide what combination of options and 
features you want your refrigerator to have so that it embodies not just your 
personal style but also fits in with the rest of the décor and of course serves 
its purpose. Remember though that the more features you have the higher the 
prices go, so unless you want to splurge on your quest for cool, shortlist the 
kind of features you are looking for on a priority basis.<br>
<br>
A base model refrigerator generally has 1-2 drawers, wire shelving, 
non-adjustable shelves/bins and may only have a partial shelf in the freezer. 
Although a base model will provide sufficient refrigeration needs, additional 
features are really a boon, especially since you’ll most likely own your 
refrigerator for 8-10 years.<br>
<br>
Some of the most popular features include ice and water dispensers and 
temperature-controlled crispers. Door-mounted ice and water dispensers are 
generally easy to find on side-by-side models, but not as common on other 
models. Most models provide water filtration and dispense ice and water through 
the door. Some dispensers have a night light feature, a filter change indicator, 
and control lockout – great if you have curious toddlers in the house!<br>
<br>
Take a look at options in shelving. Possibilities here include spill-proof glass 
shelves, adjustable height shelves, flexible space shelves, full-width or split 
shelves, elevator shelves, or built-in or removable racks, for wine. Clear 
shelves and door bins help you see what you have, no matter where it is placed 
in the refrigerator, and provide better access to items stored in the back.<br>
<br>
For maximum interior space, look for wide, glass shelves that will give you more 
surface area. In some models the glass shelves slide out thereby making it 
easier for you to use the whole shelf and store food al the way to the back. 
Adjustable glass shelves are even better, as you can move them to accommodate 
tall items, such as soda or water bottles.<br>
<br>
A must-have feature is frost-free operation. While most of today’s models are 
frost-free, do not assume that the one you are buying is; confirm it before 
purchasing.<br>
<br>
Other refrigerator features to consider include:<br>
<br>
Humidity and Temperature Controls <br>
<br>
Reversible door <br>
<br>
Removable door bins <br>
<br>
Deli or meat keeper <br>
<br>
Quick cool compartment <br>
<br>
Freezer interior light <br>
<br>
Gallon Jug Bin <br>
<br>
Butter Keeper <br>
<br>
Spill-proof shelves.<br>

Clean and cool: Panasonic’s range of air-conditioners<br>
<br>
Air-conditioners today are expected to function as more than just cooling 
machines. Purification of air is as important as cooling in order to maintain 
good health and hygiene<br>
<br>
The Panasonic 2008 range caters to these specifications of air-cooling and 
air-purification thus giving customers two-in-one value for their money. The 
latest range of Panasonic air conditioners functions as air purifier as well as 
air-conditioner. The new range with its patrol sensor and e-ion technology 
inactivates 99 per cent mould, viruses and bacteria and purifies the air five 
times faster than the conventional air-conditioner. It has got a special 
purification process, which goes through four stages to complete the 
purification.<br>
<br>
Detection of dust <br>
<br>
The patrol sensor continuously monitors indoor air quality to detect smoke and 
dust 24 hours a day even when the air-conditioner is switched off.<br>
<br>
Active e-ion Discharge <br>
<br>
Once dust or smoke is detected, the air-conditioner starts releasing the three 
trillion e-ions automatically. <br>
<br>
Inactivation of bacteria <br>
<br>
Active e-ions inactivate bacteria and viruses present in the air.<br>
<br>
<b>Collection of dust</b><br>
Dust is collected by the positively charge filter and hence leaves the room with 
the clean and healthy air. As the world continues to face energy crisis and 
companies wrestle with issues of global warming, Panasonic has introduced 
air-conditioner models that boast some of the highest EER (energy efficiency 
ratings), thereby resulting in lower electricity bills. <br>
<br>
As outdoor conditions become harsher and each summer gets hotter than the ones 
gone by owing to global warming, the compressor of the air-conditioner is 
required to perform efficiently at high temperature. Panasonic has introduced a 
new compressor in its 2008 series which can perform efficiently even at 
temperatures of 55 degree Celsius.<br>
<br>
Panasonic’s new anti-rusting coating on the condenser triples the life of its 
condenser, hence you can enjoy more years of reliable comfort plus extra economy 
in the long run.<br>
Diverse product range<br>
<br>
Panasonic’s wide range of air-conditioners include wall splits, floor/ceiling 
splits, ducted and cassette splits.<br>
<br>
Splits range include 1.0TR, 1.5TR, 2.OTR, 2.3TR, 2.5TR and 3.0TR. While the 
ducted and cassette range includes 2.0TR, 3.0TR, 3.7TR and 4.0TR. Panasonic 
air-conditioners are sold all over Oman. Omasco which are the exclusive dealers 
for the brand has got its full branches in Muscat, Sohar, Sur, Salalah and Nizwa. 
The client list includes ministries, government departments such as the ROP, SSF 
Royal office, corporates, the commercial segment and industrial segment, health 
centers, recording studios, real estate developers and many more.<br>

	<b>Cheap electricity has been one of South Africa’s selling points to 
	potential investors. HE Yacoob Abba Omar, South Africa’s Ambassador to Oman, 
	examines the crisis the country faces in ensuring continuous and cheap 
	supply of power<br>
	</b><br>
	<b>
	<img border="0" src="guest_column.jpg" width="156" height="171" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6"></b>South Africans usually bear their troubles with a large dose of humour. 
	Notwithstanding the fact that South Africa does not have the death penalty 
	on its statute, the following story has been making the rounds in response 
	to the blackouts that people have been facing: Two men have been sentenced 
	to the electric chair. They were worried how the whole thing would go but 
	were reassured by their warder that it would be a relatively quick and 
	painless experience. “One or two levers are pulled, a surge of current and 
	you’re gone,” was his chirpy reply. On the appointed date, condemned man 1 
	is herded off to the electric chair. After a few minutes, convict Number Two 
	hears screaming from the chamber. This goes on for a long while. 
	Panic-stricken, he asks the warder why did he lie to them that the exit 
	would quick and painless. The warder responds: “Blame it on electricity 
	cuts.We have now switched to candle-power!”<br>
	<br>
	Our citizens have long been used to relatively cheap and reliable supplies 
	of electricity. This has been one of the competitive advantages of our 
	economy, attracting huge energy-dependent projects such as a second 
	aluminium smelter. However, the many complaints about power outages reached 
	a crisis point on January 24 this year when major companies in the mining 
	industry announced that they were having to suspend production because of 
	unreliable power supplies. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Proactive government</b><br>
	The South African Government has been very frank in apologising to the 
	nation about the state of affairs. President Thabo Mbeki, in his annual 
	State of the Nation Address (SoNA), on February 8 at the opening of the 2008 
	parliamentary session, said: ‘We take this opportunity to convey to the 
	country the apologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national 
	emergency, which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the 
	consequences of load-shedding. I would also like to thank all citizens for 
	their resilience and forbearance in the face of the current difficulties.”<br>
  <br>
	He set out the core of the problem as follows: “In essence, the significant 
	rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new 
	capacity we have brought on stream. The resultant tight supply situation 
	makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the 
	availability of energy. In this situation, we have to curtail unplanned 
	outages and the only way we can do this immediately is to reduce demand and 
	thus ensure a better reserve margin”. The South African government, not 
	usually given to hyperbole or rhetoric, has declared the situation as a 
	national emergency. The government has immediately started implementing a 
	campaign to ensure efficient lighting, solar water heating and geyser load 
	management in households, including housing standards for all new houses and 
	developments. <br>
	<br>
	An instruction had been issued for all government buildings to reduce their 
	electricity consumption and “Please feel free to name and shame those who do 
	not,” said Mbeki. Various ministers have been tasked with coming up with a 
	power conservation programme. Provincial governments are working with mayors 
	to plan and implement energy saving measures in all municipalities across 
	the country. They are being supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings, 
	Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency.<br>

	<font face="Verdana" size="1"><img border="0" src="guest_column1.jpg" width="288" height="284" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"><b>Energy Champions</b><br>Furthermore, the President will soon be announcing a team of energy 
	champions consisting of prominent and knowledgeable South Africans who will 
	assist the government in its energy efficiency campaign and inform investors 
	and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address the 
	challenges. <br><br>Mbeki captured the approach of the government when he said, “We are indeed 
	in a period of challenges, but surmountable challenges. And precisely 
	because it is a period of challenges, it is also an era of opportunity!... 
	Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building 
	blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid.” On the 
	supply side, Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of 
	co-generation projects. Eskom’s maintenance capacity is being upgraded and 
	emergency task teams are dealing with the challenge of coal quality and 
	supply with the coal mining industry. It is estimated that the local coal 
	industry will be spending an additional US$3 billion to meet the increased 
	demand of 45 million tonnes. While this is expected to have an inflationary 
	effect, as seen in the rise in coal prices worldwide, experts expect this to 
	create more jobs and increase mining revenues. Also, the government is 
	working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects.
	<br><br>In his Budget Speech Finance Minister Trevor Manuel announced that the 
	government had allocated an additional US$10 billion to Eskom for a massive 
	programme to address new generation, transmission and distribution capacity. 
	This will be part of the US$50 billion, which the power utility will be 
	receiving over the next five years. Both Moody’s and S&amp;P welcomed the moves, 
	with Moody’s saying they planned to hold Eskom’s BCA at 8. BCA ranges from 
	1, which represents least credit risk, to 21, indicating an extraordinary 
	bailout.<br><b><br>Forging partnerships</b><br>The private sector has responded very well to these moves. For example, 
	General Electric (GE) offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine 
	equipment on behalf of the government. Large companies such as Sasol, Anglo 
	and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with government departments 
	to find cost-effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint. 
	Said the Chief Executive of Anglo American Cynthia Carroll, when addressing 
	the Mining Indaba on February 5: “I don’t regard the problems of energy 
	supply here as a disaster. And South Africa is not alone: there are 
	pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil.<br>
	<br>“Sure, the problems here are serious; overcoming them will require 
	ingenuity, specially in energy efficiency and energy saving, as well as the 
	development of alternative power supplies. But if all of us can forge strong 
	partnerships, we will all come through – I hope relatively unscathed…This is 
	not a time for finger pointing, but for working together in finding 
	solutions.”<br><br>One of the factors contributing to Eskom’s problems, analysts have pointed 
	out, is that the South African government has refused to pass on the 
	increase in costs to the consumers. Mbeki may be preparing the country for a 
	change in policy, when he said, “This situation has precipitated the 
	inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity 
	has come to an end. However, given our large base of installed generation 
	capacity, for a long time to come, ours will remain amongst the few 
	economies with affordable electricity.

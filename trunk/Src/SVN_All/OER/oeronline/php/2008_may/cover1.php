Pitching to today’s Power Women<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Outgoing, daring, free-spirited and ambitious, the modern day woman is a force 
to reckon with, both in the boardroom and outside. She is a rapidly emerging 
economic powerhouse and an avid consumer. How are marketers leveraging this 
growing ‘power of the purse’ and capitalising on women’s wealth? Nathalia Jones 
reports<br>
<i>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover.jpg" width="200" height="492" align="left" hspace="0" vspace="3">“She’s – not – just a pretty face<br>
She’s – got – everything it takes<br>
She has a fashion line –<br>
a journalist for “Time”<br>
Coaches a football team<br>
She’s a geologist – a romance novelist<br>
She is a mother of three<br>
She is a soldier – she is a wife<br>
She is a surgeon – she’ll save your life<br>
She is your waitress – she is your judge –<br>
She is your teacher<br>
She is every woman in the world”</i><br>
<br>
When pop-star Shania Twain wrote this song for her album Up, she was not only 
creating a chart-topper that celebrated womanhood, she was also profiling the 
world’s fastest-growing economic powerhouse. With more women coming into the 
workforce and with increasing disposable income as careers take precedence over 
more conservative obligations of home and family, women have become key players 
in every country’s economy, a force to reckon with. Take a look at some of these 
interesting facts. In America alone, women make 80 per cent of all buying 
decisions. They wield control over US$7 trillion worth of purchasing power and 
surveys have forecast that by 2010, they’ll control more than US$13 trillion in 
private wealth.<br>
<br>
Globally too, the scenario is fast changing, as companies the world over are 
sitting up and paying attention to this rising seat of power. Brands such as 
McDonalds, Kodak, Fair and Lovely, Pepsi have had to do a complete re-think on 
strategy, for fear that the ladies would otherwise not loosen their purse 
strings. McDonalds, for instance, suffered a drastic sales slump in 2002 when 
its advertorials just used women as a vehicle to reach children. But since their 
recent revision in strategy – their new campaigns now target the ‘woman inside 
the mom’ – their efforts have resulted in the creation of a premium brand of 
salads and healthier, more figure-friendly happy meals. What’s more, even their 
play areas have been upgraded to include wireless workstations in recognition of 
the needs of moms on the go. This willingness to listen and understand that 
women don’t just perceive themselves as mothers helped the fast food brand build 
a better relationship with its female clientele, while winning over more 
customer patronage. You’ll find many such examples extending over a wide variety 
of products, goods and services across various segments from shampoos to fast 
cars that seek to tap the growing consumer power of women.<br>
<br>
Says Diane Girard, Founder and Managing Director of Canadian-based Global Links 
Network, “I find there’s been a tremendous shift in the past 10 years; I’ve 
travelled to over 40 countries and have had the benefit of seeing that there is 
an increased awareness of women’s economic power and it shows in the 
advertisements. Women are increasingly being considered; the colours are more 
appealing to a female audience. It’s very noticeable now that there is a gender 
balance in advertisements. Women not only have that participating power, they 
influence very much the decisions marketers make. In home décor, for instance, 
it is the women who influence the purchases that are going to be made. Women are 
buying more automobiles than men, so it’s something that manufacturers are 
increasingly aware of. It’s the same with mobile phones.” Diane was among the 
motivational speakers at the second annual Women in Business conference held 
last month in Muscat.<i><img border="0" src="cover1.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="3" width="241" height="300"></i><br>
<br>
Even when a brand is not exclusively meant for a woman, it certainly is targeted 
at getting her attention. Advertisers know that women today wield considerable 
clout and influence over household purchases. For instance, 80 to 90 per cent of 
campaigns in the white goods segment are targeted at catching the female eye and 
over 50 per cent of all marketing campaigns are directed at women. “Women are 
today being projected as opinion makers, when companies strive to market 
products bought by men. For example, cars, men’s perfume, men’s clothing, etc., 
most of the ads project that women approve of a particular brand in either or 
all of these categories,” says Haider Jawad Sultan, Managing Director, Capital 
Stores.<br>
<br>
Ajay Ganti, General Manager of SARCO, calls the modern-day woman an ‘important 
catalyst’ in any buying decision where she is valued as an advisor and 
consultant, who can enable informed and sensible decisions. Women, he says, 
“represent 100 per cent of the white goods markets, as they are the actual 
end-users in most categories; white goods are like a must-have accessory in a 
woman’s life, irrespective of her lifestyle.”<br>
<br>
In her corporate bestseller, The Power of the Purse, Fara Warner identifies 
three reasons why women are a key driving force in the world of advertising and 
marketing. An economic powerhouse, CPO of the household and thirdly, women’s 
entry into the workforce has had more impact on the global GDP than China, India 
or the internet.<br>
<br>
In the Arab world too, women are stepping up and taking charge, with the result 
that corporates and FMCG distributors are now positioning power women as a 
conduit to their brands. “Woman in the GCC are, therefore, a key focus for many 
marketers as they are the key decision-makers when it comes to choosing brands 
for the family and then, of course, for themselves. Although some countries like 
Yemen and Oman are seen to be slightly under-developed, the case remains the 
same. It is estimated that an Arab female spends on an average $345 per month on 
beauty care products and is fast forming a solid bonds with our goods,” says 
Iain Potter, VP HPC for Unilever, North Africa and Middle East.<br>
<br>
However, the region is still making progress in recognising the increasing 
buying power of women, as its female citizens are still breaking out of the 
mould and often find themselves torn between domestic and social obligations, 
and their own personal <br>
aspirations.<br>
<br>
At the recently held Women in Business conference in Muscat, one of questions 
discussed was ‘What drives the Arab woman?’ The ensuing debate described her as 
‘being an integral part of a very long tradition and having a clearly prescribed 
role in society’. While that is a very basic account of who and what an Arab 
woman is, it is a perception that is undergoing a sea change as more women in 
the region are empowered to enter the workplace.<br>
<br>
As a result, they now have greater spending power and with it comes the freedom 
to spend and splurge. They are doing this and how! In Saudi Arabia alone, around 
30 per cent of all new car purchases were made by women according to researched 
reports. “Today’s Arab woman is aware of international trends and new launches. 
She cannot be misled or misinformed. She is constantly in touch with the media 
of all kinds. Most Arab women travel overseas and visit international retail 
chains such as Harrods, Saks, 5th Avenue, etc. They read international 
magazines. Therefore, it is essential to update product collection in stores. It 
is also imperative to offer adequate ambiance and services,” says Jawad Sultan 
of Capital Stores.<br>
<br>
<i>
<img border="0" src="cover3.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="3" width="262" height="286"></i><b>What women want</b><br>
When it comes to a particular brand or product, what women really want is 
‘reliability,’ according to sources from the advertising and marketing world. 
“Peer group, word of mouth and constant advertising are what drives their 
choices. As does the fact that they can now stand up to the rigours of the 
economic world and make a name for themselves. Then there’s also the reduced 
dependency on their male counterparts that make women a driving force across the 
globe spanning industries, politics and so on,” say company sources. Women 
increasingly want to be trendsetters as far as consumption habits are concerned; 
they want to eat well, dress well and travel. This is a reflection of their bold 
and outgoing spirit; a sign that they are ready to take risks in terms of 
product usage; they are ready to explore and experiment with different brands 
and products all the time. “This, in turn, drives marketers to showcase their 
products to the female audience.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<table border="0" width="101%" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="2"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Another major determining buying criterion when it comes to women is the luxury 
quotient that goes beyond just functionality and durability. According to Dr Concetta Lanciaux, Strategy Luxury Advisor, Advisor Groupe Arnault, and one of 
the speakers at last month’s Women In Business Conference, “while commodities 
are function specific, luxury goods create dreams; these refer to products that 
respond to people’s dreams as opposed to their needs.”<br>
The availability of luxury products is being underpinned by larger disposable 
incomes of women, according to Potter of Unilever. An example of this is the 
fast pace of growth of the face care market in Arabia. It is valued at US$156 
million and is growing at a whopping 12 per cent (2006 vs. 2007; AC Nielsen). 
More women are investing a more in skin and beauty products, specially as 
external appearance is directly linked to personal image and confidence. 
“Unilever is currently the market leader in the GCC, with its face care brand 
Fair and Lovely,” says Potter. “We find marketing to women is essential in 
driving category growth and consumption of our brands. Take ‘Fair and Lovely’, 
for example, a personal choice brand that we can safely say has captured the 
local female population through a very vigorous research process that 
understands what female needs are,” he adds.<br>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Opting for luxury brands</b><br>
In the Arab world, the luxury ratings of any product are given serious 
consideration and are a crucial factor in buying. “The Arab woman’s need for 
luxury branding is higher,” said Sangeetha Pendurkar, Chief Marketing Officer – 
Middle East, HSBC Bank, and also one of the participants at the Women in 
Business Conference.<br>
<br>
That statement just begs the question why are luxury brands accorded such a high 
degree of preference and priority among Arab women? Well according to Adelina 
Mustata, Client Service Director, Synovate, premium brands and luxury “are used 
as a means to overcome the feeling of inferiority and demonstrate self-worth”. 
Adelina who discussed ‘Arab women and luxury’ at the Marketing to Women 
conference, explained this gravitation towards premium products as the Arab 
woman’s portrayal of herself as one who is ‘smart, up-to-date, knowledgeable, 
distinguished and original’. Above all, it is a sign of success. The four key 
emotional pillars for what she calls ‘premiumness’ are strength/power, beauty, 
prestige and comfort.<br>
<br>
A comparative study between two major GCC markets – the UAE and Saudi Arabia – 
on what drives women’s choices in luxury brands threw up some interesting and 
insightful revelations at the conference. While in the UAE, it was found choices 
were more personality driven – that is how much of a reflection of one’s 
personality the product was – in Saudi Arabia comfort and high standards that 
were still nonetheless strongly grounded in social values were the drivers. The 
choices here leaned more towards femininity and beauty as opposed to the UAE 
where ambition and career aspirations ruled many of the luxury purchases by 
women.<br>
<br>
“From the point of view of the marketer, how does your product/brand engage with 
these women?” was one of the questions put forward by Sangeetha of HSBC. The 
answer lay in designing brands that delivered on comfort, confidence and 
control; ‘brands that drove confidence and those which helped women to meet 
challenges in the new world’.<br>
<br>
No discussion on luxury and the Arab woman can be complete without a reference 
to cars. Almost everywhere in the GCC, and certainly in Oman, you’ll find it’s 
often a woman behind the wheel of all top-end models. Top-of-the-range 
automobiles spell freedom, independence, good taste, verve and vitality. And 
it’s this combination of speed-propelled power and stylish elegance that seems 
to drive choice. According to Adelina, the fundamental meaning of cars to Arab 
women centres on five core principles – individuality, social identity, 
mobility, a source of power and social positioning, its acquisition gives her a 
feeling of strength and freedom. Again a study between the UAE and Saudi Arabia 
on the subject found that while in the UAE owning a vehicle meant being 
independent for transport, in Saudi Arabia the same car gave the woman some 
authority and say in actually buying the vehicle, even though she was not going 
to be in the driver’s seat. Either way, it allowed the Arab woman to stay on top 
of trends, which was her way of compensating for a lack of self-confidence and 
often low self-esteem. Not surprisingly, owning an automobile gave her a sense 
of control in her life and in many ways it brought about gender parity.<br>
<br>
So what marketers need to look at, according to Adelina, are the different 
layers, which are first and foremost the meaning and the influence of the 
cultural context, the fundamental meaning of the category, their specific and 
individual needs and motivations regarding specific products.<br>
<br>
<b>For the best in beauty</b><br>
The beauty and cosmetics segment is perhaps <br>
the largest selling segment when it comes to women, specially in the Arab world, 
where a lot of emphasis is placed on external appearances and personal image.<br>
<br>
Says Unilever’s Potter, “With the influx of more women in the business arena, 
the power of spending on female based products is a lot more substantial in 
growing markets around the world. For instance, the beauty care market is seeing 
a global growth of around 17 per cent and is estimated at US$2.5 billion per 
annum.”<br>
<br>
Apart from cosmetic products, long-term beauty procedures such as plastic 
surgery are fast gaining acceptance. “Oman’s booming economy has certainly 
contributed to the desire by creating a platform for wealth and exposure to the 
means of medical cosmetic services that women of all ages deserve,” says Dr 
Fatma Obaid Ali, CEO and <br>
Managing Director of Emirates Medical Centre in Muscat. On what is fuelling the 
growing preference for medical cosmetic procedures, she says, “Even considering 
that Oman is a fairly young developing country, EMC’s growth has been nothing 
less than overwhelming. I would say that specific demand for the more serious 
medical cosmetic procedures started to boom in Oman around three years ago, with 
the most significant growth in the past 18 months or so. The medical approach to 
beauty today is fast moving towards a much more holistic approach, rather than 
just the cure. Anti-aging now includes advice on your mental health, your diet, 
exercise and a number of other influencing factors.” Women at the EMC, she adds, 
make up 80 per cent of the centre’s client base, while it serves approximately 
4,500 clients very month.<br>
<br>
But are marketers and distributors leveraging the potential of this market to 
get maximum mileage for their brands, or are women in this segment 
under-represented and under-marketed to? Says Dr Ali, “Even with very visible 
wealth creation due to the dynamic development of our country, in the past 
couple of years, women and their ever-increasing needs are not taken seriously 
enough.”<br>
<br>
As mothers and career women nowadays, women have a lot move spending power than 
ever before and various stakeholders, like marketers have yet to become serious 
enough about the needs of the women in Oman regarding medical cosmetic services. 
One of the major constraints is that very little or no market research has been 
done in order to generate statistics on which small and medium enterprises can 
base their decisions. You either need to initiate your own rather costly 
investigations or surveys, or settle to base critical business decisions, either 
blindly or on perceived influences in the market. It has also been quite a 
challenge to acquire a suitable level of competence from marketing consulting 
firms in Oman,” Dr Ali concludes<br>
This scenario, she adds, contrasts with other countries in the GCC, such as the 
UAE, where women have the advantage of operating well within developed 
environments where statistics are freely available. “Their environments are also 
a lot more exposed to globalisation and media infrastructures there are a lot 
more active, with a variety of high class women magazines and other media 
platforms like TV, which provide a much greater exposure than what we still 
experience in Oman,” she adds.<br>
<br>
<b>Staying in fashion </b><br>
While the cosmetics and beauty segment in Oman may need to do a rethink on 
strategy for its female customers, the country’s fashion industry needs even 
more thought and strategy re-visioning to tap into women’s wealth. Considering 
that women in the region and certainly in Oman are gravitating towards hi-style 
and haute couture, designers feel that not enough is being done to capitalise on 
the interest. Says Samah Al Wahaibi, owner of Layali Al Asalah event management 
company as well as an employee at Oman Oil Company SAOC. “Marketing fashion to 
the Omani woman is still a challenge, specially with the case of designer wear 
because the Omani woman is still prioritising. Oman itself is new to the fashion 
world and so the industry cannot really compete on a regional or global scale. 
If you take the whole country itself, there is only Muscat where there is some 
sense of fashion or designer fashion, and one can hardly judge entire Oman by 
Muscat alone.”<br>
<br>
Adds Diana Al Zadjali, another fashion designer, “I do recognise that Oman has a 
lot of business to offer because of this rising fashion consciousness among 
women, but we as designers are hampered by the lack of technology. Fashion, as 
you know, is heavily dependant on technology because it’s a global industry and 
Oman needs that kind of cutting edge technology for it to come to par with the 
industry on a global scale. What we also need is international expertise and 
skill for design development. This is what will give us better reach and 
understanding with our customers. Another important thing we need to understand 
is that because times and trends are changing in this industry, we need to adapt 
and adopt – adapt to the changing times in terms of technology and support 
infrastructure and adopt competitive skills to develop design competence. Yes, I 
do feel that the female market group in this sector is grossly under-tapped and 
we need more fashion shows and the like to showcase designer wear to the modern 
Arab woman.”<br>
<br>
Samah feels that there has been a change in the mindset with globalisation and 
liberalisation, and yes, women out here are keeping abreast of the latest 
trends. But to say that they would invest and splurge large sums of money on 
designer wear is not entirely correct, because if they have to choose between 
that and say a car, they would choose the car over designer clothes. However, 
she does recognise that there is huge untapped potential for the fashion 
industry among women in Oman. Two major ways, according to her, to make good on 
the opportunities are setting up of fashion training institutes and removing any 
social stigma associated with fashion in the Arab world. “I think Oman needs to 
have training centres to train young, talented designers. Often, I find a lot of 
young people with the passion for design and fashion but one must recognise that 
fashion after all is a profession and a business, and like any other business, 
it needs skilled expertise to grow and succeed. Another issue is the cultural 
hurdle; our society does not accept women in the fashion business. Even in 
Dubai, which is often considered the fashion capital of the Arab world, women in 
the business are up against many social barriers. So, I think for the industry 
to fully exploit and capitalise on the potential of women’s growing consumer 
power, there has to be a change in the way we think.”<br>
<br>
Eve-olutionising strategy – ‘Let’s give ‘em something to talk about’<br>
“Knowing and understanding what drives women consumers has profound implications 
on marketing strategies,” said Adelina during her presentation at the recently 
concluded Women in Business conference. The conference demonstrated how when it 
comes to women, ‘it’s all about how products ‘feel’ in social settings’ rather 
than grand promises made by million dollar ad campaigns. “Today’s consumer is 
much more inclined to seek out information from sources they trust,” pointed out 
Dr Traek Mady, Chair, Department of Marketing and Marketing Communications, The 
American University in Dubai, at the conference. Traditional marketing then is 
just not cutting it any more as non-marketer dominated sources such news, 
critiques, club/organisations, family, friends, neighbours and casual 
acquaintances are increasingly preferred as product/brand reference points. This 
makes word of mouth the number 1 source influencing food and household product 
purchases. <br>
<br>
What then are the implications for marketing to women? According to Dr Mady, 
“Women make decisions by consensus not because they are wishy-washy or affective 
by nature, but because they are critical thinkers who want to consider a range 
of options.<br>
&nbsp;Understanding the nuances of word of mouth among women and embracing the 
unique way women share information is an extremely effective strategy for 
marketing to women.”<br>
According to Ganti of Samsung, marketers need to revisit strategy to ensure it 
embodies a more ‘holistic approach’ that connects with the EQ or emotional 
quotient of the fairer sex. “Any strategy which is set against the backdrop of a 
relationship with the product’s or brand’s significance in the foreground will 
have a more far reaching impact. Women would then be able to relate to the 
product/brand and understand its advantages at the same time.”<br>
<br>
Adds Diane, “Is there enough marketing done to business women? I would say in a 
lot of places yes, but there’s still some shifting that needs to take place, 
change in mindset and I think women need to be consulted a lot more in their 
environment. They can’t readily adapt strategies that have been used for men in 
the past, it’s just a totally different way that women think and network. Women 
are more word of mouth and referrals.”<br>
<br>
Good word of mouth strategies, says Dr Mady, must encourage communication, one 
should invest in listening, give women incentives to be the product’s/brand’s 
marketer, and should entail strategies that engage in transparent conversations 
and information sharing. In short, these strategies should give women something 
to talk about.<br>
<br>
And companies everywhere are certainly giving the ladies a lot to talk about. 
The world over, banks, financial institutions, FMCG distributors and 
manufacturers are waking up to the women’s wealth. In the Gulf too, the 
phenomenon is catching on. With women accounting for a significant and growing 
proportion of the Gulf’s capital, both financial and human resource, banks and 
investment funds are alerting themselves to the opportunities for providing 
services and products to women and women-run companies. According to Bramdean, a 
London-based fund management firm, women account for some $240 billion of 
personal wealth and 60 per cent of that is held in cash. In Saudi Arabia, women 
hold roughly one-third of the bank accounts, with deposits of over $7 billion.<br>
<br>
In her presentation at the Women in Business conference, Jane Kinninmont, 
Editor, The Economist, Economist Intelligence Unit, UK, pointed out that some 
estimates show 40 per cent of Saudi real estate is held by women, though they 
own only 20 per cent of investments in mutual funds.<br>
<br>
But there are challenges as marketers endeavour to capitalise on women’s wealth. 
Says Ganti, “The biggest challenge is to build up trust with a brand or product. 
Women don’t trust that easily and once they do, they expect a lot in return. 
Also, marketers have to be quite vigilant, innovative and alert with new ideas 
and strive for constant change in their presentation, with new additions to 
products/services, which are all imperative to keep the freshness of the idea 
intact.” </font></p>

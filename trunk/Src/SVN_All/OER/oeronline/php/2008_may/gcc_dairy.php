        was conducted by Maktood Research in March and focused on 7,434 
        residents of diverse nationalities across 11 countries in the GCC, 
        Levant and North Africa region.<br>
        <br>
        Of the total number of people under research Oman topped the happy 
        people list with 61 per cent followed closely by Saudi Arabia which 
        recorded 57 per cent. “Our first ‘Happiness Survey’ has revealed some 
        very interesting results. The GCC countries emerge as the happiest with 
        Oman and Saudi Arabia taking the lead. The survey has also revealed that 
        respondents below the age of 18 and above 36 are the happiest. Another 
        important finding is that one of the most quoted factors for unhappiness 
        among surveyed countries is the rising cost of living,” said Tamara 
        Deprez, Maktoob Research director. <br>
        <br>
        According to a company statement, “A number of studies have been 
        conducted in recent years by psychologists, who have endeavoured to find 
        out whether happiness can truly benefit a person. Results from these 
        studies have shown that happiness can indeed improve the quality of our 
        lives. People who are happy are more likely to enjoy improved emotional 
        and physical health, have stronger immune systems, live longer, possess 
        higher energy levels, and use their intelligence more efficiently.”<br>
        <br>
        Benefits at the workplace include higher creativity, increased 
        productivity and better salaries while social benefits came from larger 
        circles of friends, better marital relationships, stronger social 
        support and richer social interaction, it said. “With a list of benefits 
        this large, it’s no wonder that people the world over constantly seek 
        novel ways to increase their levels of happiness,” said the statement.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of the key findings of the survey were factors that contribute to 
        happiness and reasons for unhappiness. The survey found that happiness 
        boosters included an optimistic nature, being part of a close-knit and 
        loving family, marital stability, good friends, strong religious faith, 
        high levels of job satisfaction, financial and career stability, sizable 
        income, good health, a successful career and achievement of personal 
        goals. Similarly, major reasons for unhappiness include battling high 
        costs of living, problems at work, poor salaries, unemployment, ill 
        health, obesity, problems with personal image, an unhappy marital and 
        family life, the lack of friends, large debts, unsatisfactory academic 
        results, general instability and uncertainty regarding the future.<br>
        <br>
        According to some respondents from Lebanon, one of the chief reasons for 
        unhappiness is the current lack of political stability in the country. 
        But a good number of respondents said they saw themselves as neither 
        happy nor unhappy but somewhere in between.<br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly, the results reflected equal levels of happiness among men 
        and women across the region. The combined percentage was 49 per cent 
        where 19 per cent men and 17 per cent women described themselves as 
        unhappy with the remaining standing in between. Older respondents (aged 
        46 and above) were clearly the happiest with an overall happiness 
        quotient of 59 per cent. They were followed by the middle aged group 
        (ages 36 – 45) who recorded 54 per cent on the happiness scale. Next 
        came respondents below the age of 18 with a happiness quotient of 53 per 
        cent and the 18-35 age-group recorded <br>
        47.5 per cent.

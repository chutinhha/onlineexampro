gas per day this year as against last year’s 63 million cubic metres per day, 
according to Dr Zayed bin Khamis al Siyabi, Director General (production and 
exploration) of the Ministry of Oil and Gas. He added the commissioning of the 
Kauther gas treatment plant in central Oman helped Petroleum Development Oman 
enhance its gas output. “PDO is investing over US$1 billion in various projects 
to enhance output this year and the years to come,” said Dr Al Siyabi. He also 
pointed out that two British oil and gas firms – British Gas and British 
Petroleum – will be investing nearly US$1 billion over the next three to five 
years towards the development of some of Oman’s largest gas and condensate 
concessions. These include the Khazzan and Makarem gas fields in central Oman, 
with estimated reserves of 30 trillion cubic feet, and the Abu Butabul gas and

Bharat Oman Refineries (BORL) is expected to raise US$1 billion through its 
initial public offering towards setting up a refinery project in the Indian 
State of Madhya Pradesh. The company has already filed a draft red herring 
prospectus to this effect with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. BORL 
is promoted by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Oman Oil Company and has 
interests in oil refining and marketing of petroleum products. The upcoming 
refinery is a grassroots project to be set up at a capital cost of around US$2.5 
billion, which will be funded through a mix of debt and equity. BORL has entered 
into an agreement with a consortium of lenders for a debt component of 
approximately Rs 6,400 crore. It is expected to commence commercial operations 
by January 2010. BORL has signed an off-take agreement with BPCL according to 
which the latter will purchase most of the refinery’s petroleum products.<br>

track</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Sohar Aluminium is all set to meet its mid-June target for its first hot metal

March. The department produced its first ‘good green anode’ on March 26, marking 
the first step in the on-going metal production process. “From the production of 
the first anode, less than a week of process tuning and equipment adjustments 
were necessary to produce the quality of ‘good green’ anode that will suit our 
requirements,” said General Manager Operations, Michel Huot. Another milestone 
was achieved three days later when the smelter’s new Anode Baking Furnace was 
successfully started, along with the Solios Fume Treatment Centre and the 
Innovatherm’s Firing System. The Sohar Aluminium smelter is in the process of 
being handed over by the company’s EPCM contractor, Bechtel. To date, the 
smelter construction is around 85 per cent complete and commissioning in most 
areas is well underway.<br>

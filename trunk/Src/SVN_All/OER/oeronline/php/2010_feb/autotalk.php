					<b>We had driven the A5 last year and it swept us off our feet. 
                    Just two months back Audi launched two more iterations of 
                    the A5, the cabriolet and the Sportback. Malcolm Xavier Crasta 
                    managed to snag a Sportback for a test drive to see how good 
                    it really is</b></font></p>
                  <p align="center" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><b>
				<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CC3300">
				    <img border="0" src="images/AUTOTALK.gif" hspace="9" vspace="5" width="430" height="152" style="border: 1px solid #C0C0C0"></font></b></p>
                  <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">From the outside it shares much of its look with the handsome 
                    A5 coupe, with identical nose and tail sections, but stretched 
                    to accommodate an extra pair of seats and doors. With its 
                    short overhangs, wide track, frameless doors and a gently 
                    sloping rear windscreen it makes for a very elegant design 
                    that is pleasing to the eye from practically any angle. Just 
                    like the exterior, the interior is also identical to that 
                    of an A5, which is to be expected. And as you have come to 
                    expect from Audi, the interior is lush and purposeful. Quality 
                    is top-notch and it feels special, just like a car of this 
                    type should. The seats are some of the most comfortable we 
                    have ever sat in and it is as spacious as an A4 in the front 
                    and rear, although really tall people may find the rear headroom 
                    slightly limiting, but this is something that we have found 
                    to be a common issue with every car of this type. The driving 
                    </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">position is near perfect as well and visibility as good as 
                    that of the coupe, which also means slightly restricted rear 
                    visibility.<br>
					<br>
                    As far as equipment is concerned, there isn’t anything special 
                    to pay attention to but there isn’t anything notably missing 
                    either. You get all the regular bells and whistles that you 
                    can expect from a car such as this and at this price range. 
                    A good sound system, cruise control, power sunroof, front 
                    and rear parking sensors, dual-zone air conditioning and more 
                    are all available. And it is the same case with safety equipment 
                    as well. Front, side and curtain airbags, ABS and traction 
                    control are all available as standard. <br>
					<br>
                    Under the bonnet lies a 2.0 litre turbocharger four-cylinder 
                    engine producing 211hp. Mated to Audi’s 7-speed S-tronic transmission 
                    and Quattro all-wheel-drive system, the results are impressive. 
                    In a straight line the Sportback feels a lot faster than it 
                    actually is and through corners the grip and stability is 
                    incredible by any standards. The chunky steering is precise 
                    and full of feel but feels a bit rough. A little more smoothness 
                    would be welcome. On the highway the ride is competent and 
                    the cabin is well refined, an impressive feat considering 
                    the frameless doors.<br>
					<br>
                    On the whole the A5 Sportback makes for a great and sportier 
                    alternative to an A4 or a family friendly alternative to an 
                    A5. While some may argue that the ride is a bit hard and exhaust 
                    too loud to make it a family saloon, you should not look at 
                    it like one. It is more of a four door sport grand tourer 
                    and in that respect it is near perfect, especially when you 
                    consider the performance and the practicality that accompanies 
                    it. </font><br>

					Raysut Cement Company (RCC) was formed in 1981 with a 
					210,000 tonne capacity four-stage suspension pre-heater 
					kiln. Today, Raysut Cement’s total cement capacity has 
					reached to 3 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) and 
					counts among the biggest producers in the Middle East. 
					Throughout these years the company has maintained its pace 
					for growth through cost efficient management, with an 
					enhanced product range. The RCC won ‘His Majesty Cup’ for 
					the best five factories in Oman nine years in a row, from 
					1991 to 1999, and the ‘Environmental Cup’ in the years 1986, 
					1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. <br>
					<br>
					Today, some 1,500 customers in the oil well exploration and 
					construction industry in Middle-east, Asia and Africa look 
					to Raysut Cement for top quality cement and services. Many 
					major infrastructure projects are being constructed using 
					Raysut Cement. The RCC also currently holds ISO 9001-2008, 
					ISO 14001-2004 and API 10A-0006 certificates. At the helm of 
					the prestigious company sits Mohammed Ahmed Al Dheeb, its 
					current Chief Executive Officer. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Down memory lane<br>
					</b>Mohammed Al Dheeb studied at Al Saidiya School in 
					Salalah. In 1981, he completed his school education and 
					scored the third highest rank in Oman. As a result the 
					Ministry of Education had offered him a scholarship and sent 
					him to the US for further education. In the year 1986 he 
					completed his bachelor’s degree in Business Administration 
					from the University of Arizona. After completing his degree 
					he joined the Ministry of Education and worked in various 
					departments such as planning, administration and finance at 
					the executive levels. In 1996 he joined the Raysut Cement 
					Company in Salalah as a deputy general manager. He was later 
					promoted to the general manager position and finally as CEO.<br>
					<br>
					A very positive thinking person, Al Dheeb, is a strong 
					believer in forgiveness and respect for all people in 
					society as well as in his organisation. He is always on the 
					lookout for honest, loyal, hard working and sincere people. 
					In spite of work pressures he always tries to make time for 
					his family. He says, “Even though work pressure is there, I 
					always try to manage to make time for my family members and 
					I am confident that I can fulfill the task in my work place 
					as well as in my family life.” After work hours he usually 
					spends time playing sports, reading, social obligations or 
					with family members. An avid traveller, his favourite travel 
					destinations are countries with a rich cultural history.<br>
					<br>
					With such an impressive background and such strong values Al 
					Deeb is sure to lead the RCC through to many more successful 
					years.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

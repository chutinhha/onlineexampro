sentenced to 9 years in prison</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
A man convicted for illegal spamming was sentenced to nine years imprisonment in 
the US. This is the first felony prosecution for sending junk e-mail in the 
country. The sentence has been postponed and the case has been appealed. A jury 
had recommended the nine-year prison term after convicting Jeremy Jaynes of 
pumping out at least 10 million e-mails a day with the help of 16 high-speed 
lines. The kind of Internet capacity that the spammer used can serve the needs 
of a 1,000-employee company.<br>
<br>
Prosecutors have described Jaynes as among the top 10 spammers in the world at 
the time of his arrest. He used the fake name of Gaven Stubberfield and other 
aliases to peddle junk products and pornography. Prosecutors say he grossed up 
to $750,000 (RO288,462) a month. Meanwhile, Jaynes has guaranteed the court that 
he will not be involved in the e-mail marketing business again.<br>

unveils satellite map feature</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Online search engine Google has unveiled a new feature that will enable its 
users to zoom in on homes and businesses using satellite images. Google began 
offering the satellite technology when it bought digital mapmaker Keyhole 
Corporation. Google now offers free access to Keyhole’s high-tech maps through 
its search engine. Users previously had to pay $29.95 (RO11.500) to download a 
version of Keyhole’s basic software package. <br>
<br>
A more traditional map will continue to be the first choice served up by 
Google’s search engine. Users will have the option of retrieving a satellite 
picture by clicking on a button. The new technology has, however, raised 
concerns for privacy. The satellite maps are designed to provide close-up 
perspective of specific addresses, say some. <br>
<br>
John Hanke, Keyhole’s general manager, however, believes that there is no reason 
for people to be worried about the satellite maps because the images used are 
not latest ones. They are roughly six to 12 months old. ‘‘And it isn’t like you 
are going to be able to read a licence plate on a car or see what an individual 
was doing when a particular image was taken,’’ he said.</font></p>

<br>
Sony Corporation has filed for a patent of an idea that will let the users 
smell, touch and even taste movies and video games. According to the New 
Scientist magazine, Sony has patented an idea that would use non-invasive 
ultrasound pulses to transmit ‘‘sensory experiences’’ directly to the brain, 
modifying the firing patterns of certain neurons. With such technology, the 
users will be able to watch movies and play games that they could taste and 
touch in their brain. According to the patent application, it might even allow 
blind people to ‘‘see’’ and deaf people to ‘‘hear.’’<br>
<br>
Sony spokesperson said this is just an idea. ‘‘Every time you submit a patent, 
you have to give a description and that’s all this is at this point,’’ she said. 
‘‘This is not anything Sony has invested any research in, but it's based on an 
idea of something that they may think about in the future.’’ While the project 
is not currently being pursued, the concept of living a Neo-like existence sure 
seems exciting.</font></p>

                    rated as the most advanced liquid crystal display computer 
                    monitor in the Middle East. The new monitor has been 
                    designed for button-less use except for the power button. 
                    Furthermore, Samsung’s MagicTune software enables the mouse 
                    to control monitor settings. The new LCD monitor model 
                    boasts the highest contrast ratio in the world (1500:1), 
                    enabling a clearer display of vivid images. Along with its 
                    proprietary MagicColor engine, this monitor creates perfect

                    PlayStation consoles in the US due to an alleged patent 
                    infringement. The company has been ordered to pay $90 
                    million in damages to a US tech company, Immersion Corp., 
                    but it will appeal the decision by a California federal 
                    court immediately, an SCE spokesman said. <br>
                    <br>
                    Immersion is a California-based developer and licensor of 
                    touch-feedback technology to enhance video game realism. 
                    According to a report, the company charged that Sony 
                    infringed on its technology that makes a game controller 
                    vibrate in sync with actions in the games being played. In 
                    the meantime, Sony will continue to sell its PlayStations as

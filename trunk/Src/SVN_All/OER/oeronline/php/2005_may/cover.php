            year 2004 continued to be positive for Oman’s economy in general and 
            significantly bullish for the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) in 
            particular. The price of oil continued to increase during the year. 
            Oman crude realised an avera</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ge 
            price of $33.9 a barrel in 2004 compared with the budgeted price of 
            $21 a barrel. This price increase more than compensated the fall in 
            oil production from 824,000 barrels per day to 763,000 bpd. 
            Moreover, the year 2004 also saw a continuing increase in income 
            from LNG. This resulted in a reversal of the planned budgeted 
            deficit to a surplus.<br>
            <br>
            The MSM also continued to perform well during the year 2004. Cash 
            liquidity during the year eased and liquidity of stocks improved 
            substantially. New IPOs like Al Maha Petroleum, Dhofar University, 
            Al Kamil Power and AES Barka added flavor to the services sector of 
            the market and helped improve market activity. Trading volumes 
            amounted to RO763 million in 2004 compared to RO593 million in 2003, 
            an increase of 29 per cent. <br>
            <br>
            The General Price Index was renamed the MSM 30. The Index was also 
            re-based to 1,000 in line with other international indices and 
            reconstituted to reflect the market capitalisation more 
            appropriately. The adjusted benchmark MSM 30 Index ended the year to 
            close at its 4-year high of 3,375.05 points, a gain of 23.78 per 
            cent for the year. The top performer was the Industry Sector, which 
            was up 34.7 per cent followed by the Banking and Investment Sector, 
            which gained 23.9 per cent and the Services Sector ended with an 
            increase of 12.7 per cent for the year. Foreign participation in the 
            MSM also registered an increase during the year.<br>
            <br>
            The government continued its emphasis of diversifying the economy 
            away from dependence on oil. Several mega projects were launched 
            including the Sohar Petrochemical plant, Sohar Power &amp; Desalination 
            plant, a fertiliser plant and several other large projects. The 
            government continued to pursue its privatisation policy. A second 
            mobile licence was awarded to Nawras Telecom. <br>
            <br>
            Substantial progress has been made during the year 2004 with regard 
            to tourism. A separate ministry of Tourism was created during the 
            year. The Wave Project was launched. Several other tourism related 
            projects are in the pipeline. The easing of visas had a major impact 
            on the hotel and travel industry in this year. Hotels were fully 
            booked for the better part of the year and, for the first time in 
            Muscat, one had to make reservations in advance to get a table at 
            some of the better restaurants in town.<br>
            <br>
            On the international scene, the investment landscape last year 
            showed resilience in the face of unrest. Throughout the year, the 
            strength of US corporate earnings provided support to the market 
            while concerns about escalating oil prices, the falling dollar, and 
            rising interest rates created intermittent uncertainty, much of 
            which seemed to dissipate at year-end. In the end, 2004 proved to be 
            a reasonable year, with positive returns in both the stock and bond 
            markets. A late-year surge boosted the returns of hedge funds as 
            well as US stocks, with fourth quarter gains driving most of the 
            calendar year 2004.<br>
            <br>
            During the year 2004, the revenues of Oman’s 20 largest companies 
            showed a handsome growth. Total revenues for The OER 20 went up by 
            8.19 per cent to RO1,016 million. Corporate performance of the year 
            2004, overall, was also extremely positive. The profits for the year 
            2004 increased dramatically by 186 per cent to RO132 million from 
            the figure of RO46 million last year. The main reason for the dismal 
            performance of last year was the substantial loss of RO52 million 
            posted by National Bank of Oman (NBO), which completely distorted 
            the overall figure in 2003.<br>
            <br>
            The total market cap of The OER 20 on December 31, 2004, was RO1,560 
            million, which was up by 23 per cent compared to 2003. On April 20, 
            2005, the market cap of The OER 20 was once again substantially up 
            to RO2,011 million. The OER 20 companies represented 44 per cent to 
            the total market cap of the MSM of RO3.587 billion at the end of 
            2004. The average P/E ratio of The OER 20 based on the profits of 
            the year 2004 and the share price on April 20, 2005, is 15.28 times 
            earnings. <br>

            Who’s <b>in, </b>who’s<b> out?</b><br>
            We have two newcomers on the list this year. Al Maha Petroleum comes 
            straight into the No. 3 spot and Al Jazeera Tube Mills is at No. 15. 
            These companies have made it to The OER 20 this year at the expense 
            of United Power Company and Oman National Investment Holding Company 
            simply because the newcomers had higher turnovers. The ranking of 
            Oman’s 20 largest companies in order of revenue produces a list, 
            which includes the five major banks, one insurance company, seven 
            companies from the industrial sector and seven companies from the 
            services sector. <br>

            has been one change in The Top 5 companies in Oman. Al Maha 
            Petroleum has replaced NBO, which was in the third place last year. 
            Oman Oil has moved up one place and Oman Aviation has slipped one 
            place. The top two companies remain unchanged from last year. Shell 
            Oman Marketing (SOM) continues to remain the largest public company 
            in Oman, but BankMuscat seems to be swiftly catching up. SOM has 
            once again this year shown a negative growth in revenue of –12.75 
            per cent. <br>
            <br>
            Dr Andrew Wood, the chairman of SOM, in his report to the 
            shareholders explains that 2004 has seen an intensifying level of 
            challenge in the market. Dr Wood outlines a number of key aspects of 
            the business environment that have either contributed positively to 
            the results or have posed a significant challenge.<br>
            <br>
            Dr Wood explains to the shareholders the outlook for year 2005 is 
            generally strong, given the encouraging economic scene in the 
            Sultanate. In their own business, although the regulatory 
            authorities have initiated processes to scrutinise licensing of new 
            retail service stations, the aggressive network expansion in the 
            industry will continue to be a major threat. The company’s ability 
            to invest will be fully focused upon such investments opportunities 
            where long-term shareholder value growth can be achieved. <br>
            <br>
            The key growth areas are constantly under observation to augment any 
            demand gaps arising due to demographic and road network 
            developments. The major construction project activity is also 
            expected to provide increased demand although SOM expects increasing 
            levels of price competition to secure this volume.<br>

            the first time since this review started being published, only three 
            of The Top 5 most profitable companies in Oman are banks. It is 
            encouraging to note that all five companies are showing growth in 
            profits for the year. There has been one change in the top five 
            companies by profit. Ominvest, which was in fifth place last year, 
            is out. Renaissance Services has leapfrogged to the No. 3 spot from 
            No. 9 last year. BankDhofar has slipped to the No. 5 position after 
            being at No. 3 last year. The top two companies remain unchanged 
            from last year. <br>
            <br>
            BankMuscat was once again the most profitable company in Oman as 
            well as the second largest company in Oman based on turnover for the 
            year 2004. BankMuscat has maintained this position by attaining a 
            growth in profit for the year of about 26 per cent. The chairman 
            Sheikh AbdulMalik bin Abdullah Al-Khalili states in his report to 
            the shareholders that the year 2004 was amongst the busiest that the 
            bank has seen in the recent past. On the retail side, Sheikh 
            AbdulMalik explains that the bank took a significant step in its 
            vision to diversify its revenue streams by introducing bancassurance 
            in Oman. The bank’s international operations also saw considerable.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sheikh AbdulMalik goes on to say that BankMuscat commands a market 
            share of over 36.7 per cent in terms of total assets, 37.6 per cent 
            of total credit and over 36.9 per cent of total customer deposits. 
            The board has proposed a cash dividend of 49 per cent for the year 
            2004. the chairman confirmed that BankMuscat was on track to 
            achieving the vision of becoming one of the foremost banks in the 
            region by the turn of the decade.<br>

            Jazeera Tube Mills has shown the highest growth in profits by a 
            staggering 840.17 per cent and has jumped straight to the No. 1 
            spot. Four companies that were in The Top 5 last year, ONIC Holding, 
            OMINVEST, Salalah Port Services, and Oman Cement Company have moved 
            out. It is indeed, a distinction to feature in this list for two 
            consecutive years – a feat achieved in last year’s rankings by 
            OMINVEST. This year, Renaissance Services at No. 2 (No. 1 last year) 
            has managed this achievement. Oman Aviation Services at No. 3, 
            National Bank of Oman at No. 4 and Oman Cables Industry at No. 5 are 
            the other three new companies that have made it to this list.<br>
            <br>
            Ahmed bin Mohamed bin Omeir Al Hinai, the chairman of Al Jazeera 
            Tube Mills, in his report to the shareholders states that, in 2004, 
            the steel industry enjoyed one of its best years ever. The industry, 
            which has suffered from an oversupply for a number of years, saw a 
            change in its fortunes from mid-2002, when a balance between demand 
            and supply was being experienced; thus, this resulted in a steady 
            improvement in prices of all steel products. In 2002, the only major 
            economy that pushed up demand and therefore pushed up steel prices 
            was China. That was the reason for the minor improvement in steel 
            prices. The improvement in late 2003 and early 2004, pushed demand 
            to new height resulting in the unprecedented acceleration in the 
            steel prices witnessed in 2004.<br>
            <br>
            Al Hinai adds that the company explored the possibilities and 
            maximised on the opportunities that this dramatic situation offered. 
            It was realised early on that this situation will put tremendous 
            strain on the working capital required to purchase this much more 
            expensive raw material. But the company was fortunate in receiving 
            the timely support of their bankers. As a result, Al Jazeera 
            actually increased its operational size. Al Hinai advises that the 
            Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry has approved to grant government 
            soft loan for setting up of fourth tube mill to manufacture pipes 
            ranging from 2” NB to 6’’ NB. The expansion project is in progress 
            and is expected to commence the trial production by end 2005.<br>
            <br>
            Further, as announced a few months ago, the company will start a 
            sub-contractual manufacturing relationship in Saudi Arabia. If this 
            is successful, it will be a model for other ventures. Sheikh 
            AbdulMalik explains that, during the year, the shareholders in the 
            ordinary general meeting held on September 25, 2004, duly approved 
            an interim stock dividend in the ratio of 1:2 equity shares and 
            accordingly the issued and fully paid up capital increased by 
            1,200,000 of RO 1/- each in the year. Further, he states that the 
            directors recommend a final stock dividend of 70% of the issued and 
            paid-up capital. <br>
            <br>
            It is important to understand that, with all these expansion that 
            the company has undertaken, the company will require substantially a 
            larger capital base to fund and finance it, and this is the reason 
            we recommend this increase in the capital of the company.<br>

            of the top five companies that have the highest amount of equity 
            employed are banks. There is no change in this list from last year. 
            Oman International Bank (OIB) is the second highest capitalised 
            company in Oman. Reem Omar Zawawi, the chairperson, states in her 
            report to the shareholders that the year 2004 was a productive year 
            for the bank with several major achievements. The bank started the 
            year with celebration of its 20th Anniversary. Their focus during 
            the year was consolidating their position in the local market, 
            increasing their market share, enhancing asset quality while 
            reducing operating expenses. In addition, the emphasis of continued 
            improvement of customer service was a major priority. <br>
            <br>
            Zawawi states that OIB’s performance for the year has been, once 
            again, very encouraging. Business continues to perform well, driven 
            by the excellent momentum in retail, corporate and treasury 
            activities. As a result of strong growth in the loan book, funded by 
            low cost deposits, the Net Interest Income increased from RO24.698 
            million in 2003 to RO27.493 million in 2004, a growth of 11.3 per 
            cent. Other income for the year 2004 of RO8.898 million showed a 
            growth of 13.2 per cent over the previous year, largely the result 
            of increased volume of retail and corporate business. <br>
            <br>
            Zawawi explains that their efforts to reduce operating expenses 
            continue with several cost rationalisation initiatives undertaken 
            during the year. The results reflect a favourable trend with the 
            Operating Expenses reflecting a reduction of 8.1 per cent from the 
            previous year. The Cost to Income ratio declined to 47.5 per cent 
            for the current year as compared to 56.0 per cent for the previous 
            year. Accordingly, the bank’s Operating Profit increased from 
            RO14.911 million in 2003 to RO19.273 million in 2004, a strong 
            growth of 29.3 per cent. OIB’s commitment to improve asset quality 
            and thereby reduce the provision for loan impairment continues with 
            the specific provision for loan impairment for the year decreasing 
            by 29.6 per cent to RO4.410 million compared to the previous year.
            <br>

            Zawawi adds that overall the year was a rewarding one for the bank’s 
            shareholders. In addition to the payment of the cash dividend of 21 
            per cent on the face value of the share, the bank’s share price also 
            appreciated by 43.5 per cent. The bank looks to the future with full 
            confidence and optimism. The prudent macroeconomic policies of the 
            government of the Sultanate will provide ample opportunities for 
            banks to meet the needs of their customers. This, together with the 
            solid business franchise that the bank enjoys in Oman, and the 
            significant market share gained over the past year, leads us to 
            believe that OIB will be successful in expanding and developing its 
            business, and thereby continuing to contribute to the progress of 
            the nation.<br>

            again, four of the top five companies in Oman having the highest 
            market capitalisation are banks. The list is the same as last year 
            except that OIB and Oman Cement have moved one place up and NBO and 
            BankDhofar have both slipped a place.<br>
            <br>
            The Chairman of NBO, Suhail Salim Bahwan, in his report to the 
            shareholders states that the outcome of the bank’s operations for 
            the year 2004 resulted in a net profit of RO 5.2 million. This 
            contrasted with a net loss of RO 51.8 million reported for the year 
            ended December 31, 2003. In terms of balance-sheet evolution, the 
            focus in 2004 was cost control and asset liability management with 
            special emphasis on fund management. <br>
            <br>
            Bahwan adds that during the year, additional provisions of RO30.3 
            million were established which are significantly lower than the 
            RO70.7 million established in 2003. Bahwan explains that the actual 
            provision recoveries and releases showed an improvement from RO1.5 
            million in 2003 to RO18.5 million in 2004.<br>
            <br>
            With regard to the proposed merger plans with BankMuscat, Bahwan 
            goes on to explain that in February 2005, the board of directors met 
            to consider the various issues and outstanding matters relating to 
            the proposed merger and after considering the best interest of all 
            the stakeholders and the ongoing delays in reaching an agreement on 
            the outstanding issues it was decided not to pursue with the 
            proposed merger. Bahwan is confident that throughout 2005 and 
            beyond, management will focus on prudently growing the business as 
            well as continue with their remedial efforts which has shown a very 
            promising start in 2004.<br>

            none of the top five companies showing the best Return on Equity 
            Employed come from the banking sector. Renaissance Services 
            continues to retain the top position for the second successive year 
            showing a return on equity of a massive 54.02 per cent. Two 
            companies that were in the Top 5 last year, Salalah Port Services 
            and Oman Oil Marketing, have moved out. Dhofar Insurance and Shell 
            Oman Marketing have slipped one place. Al Jazeera Tube Mills at No. 
            2 and Areej Vegetable at No. 5 are the two new companies that have 
            made it to this list.<br>
            <br>
            Stephen Thomas, the CEO of Renaissance Services, states in his 
            report to the shareholders that the year 2004 was an exceptional 
            year by every measure. Revenue is up from RO45.973 million to 
            RO62.580 million; and Net Profit up from RO4.867 million to RO13.461 
            million. These results have generated strong cash flows enabling the 
            company to reward the shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet, 
            reduce debt and generate resources and financial flexibility to 
            invest in the future growth.<br>
            <br>
            With the exception of the Education &amp; Training Group, which had a 
            breakeven at the operating level, every business in the group has 
            delivered higher profit contributions this year: The Contract 
            Services Group - RO15.7 million; the Technology Group - RO949,000; 
            and the Media Communications Group - RO199,000. Profit contribution 
            of RO835,000 has also been realised in the group’s other 
            investments, including from the Dubai Wire Group (DWG). <br>
            <br>
            Increasing regional penetration is key to the company’s growth 
            plans. The macro-environment in the region is challenging but offers 
            tremendous opportunity to the company’s services businesses.<br>

            new companies have entered the ranking of the top five earnings per 
            share growth companies. Al Jazeera Tube Mills at the No. 1 spot, 
            Oman Aviation Services, National Bank of Oman, and Oman Cables 
            Industry (OCI) are the newcomers replacing ONIC Holding, Salalah 
            Port Services, OMINVEST, and Oman Cement. Again, similar to the 
            Growth of Profits listing, featuring for two successive years in the 
            EPS Growth listing is an honourable accomplishment. This commendable 
            performance was turned in by Renaissance Services at No. 2 (No. 1 
            last year).<br>
            <br>
            The chairman of Oman Cables, Mustafa bin Mukhtar bin Ali Al Lawati, 
            explains in his annual report to the shareholders that major 
            expansion project of Medium Voltage Cables (MV Cables) was completed 
            by the end of 2003; production of MV cables started in 2004. With 
            that, the company has been able to launch the new product range of 
            MV Cables successfully both in the local and international markets. 
            Al Lawati adds that the year 2004 was a year of tremendous increase 
            in the prices of the raw materials worldwide. This naturally 
            resulted in increase in the selling price of cables. <br>
            <br>
            OCI's sales have increased from RO22.16 million in 2003 to RO36 
            million in 2004, an increase of 62 per cent compared to the previous 
            year. International exports helped in expanding OCI’s marketing 
            activities considerably. The net profit before tax is RO1.555 
            million compared to RO0.764 million in 2003, an increase of 103 per 
            cent compared to 2003. In line with the guidance issued by the 
            Capital Market, the board has recommended a dividend of 20 per cent 
            subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting. <br>

            share price growth of the top five companies exceeded by far the 
            average growth of the MSM index of 23.78 per cent. Interestingly, 
            the top four companies on this list are newcomers and only Oman 
            Cement retains its position at No. 5 from last year. Al Jazeera Tube 
            Mills is on top of the list of companies registering the best share 
            price growth in the year 2004.<br>
            <br>
            Samir Fancy, the Chairman of Topaz Energy &amp; Marine, in his report to 
            the shareholders states that 2004 was a very successful year for 
            company. Fancy explains that the company continues to progress well 
            and recorded a net income of RO2.507 million (18 per cent) on sales 
            of RO24.652 million (11 per cent) in 2004. This compares very 
            favourably with 2003 when the results were RO2.125 million and 
            RO22.172 million, respectively. EPS increased to RO0.143 (RO0.112 in 
            2003) for the year. <br>
            <br>
            Fancy adds that as a result, the board is pleased to recommend a 
            dividend of 10 per cent (2003 @ 9 per cent) for the year 2004. Fancy 
            advises that all TEAM divisions performed well for the year. 
            Overall, the group saw healthier operating margins and benefited 
            from the focus on efficiency improvements. It is significant that 
            these results have been derived from operations alone unlike other 
            years where sales of ships have added to business income. This is a 
            very satisfactory situation and indicates the potential to enhance 
            earnings in the future. <br>
            <br>
            Fancy explains that significant milestones in 2004 include the 
            commencement of construction of new distribution facilities for our 
            stainless steel trading business (Mezon Trading) in the Jebel Ali 
            Free Trade Zone and for Adyard’s maintenance services division in 
            Abu Dhabi. The new facilities will enhance the company’s ability to 
            service customer requirements in the future. The acquisition of the 
            assets of Fujairah Marine Services in Q4 will enable Nico 
            International, the Ship Repair Division, to increase market share 
            and expand into new services in the strategically important eastern 
            seaboard of the UAE. <br>
            <br>
            The company continues to strengthen their asset base with the 
            acquisition of two second-hand AHTS vessels at competitive prices in 
            Q4. The vessels are expected to join the Nico World fleet in Q2 
            2005. Looking forward, Fancy explains that the oil &amp; gas market 
            remains strong and the outlook for all TEAM operating companies is 
            positive. Growth through acquisition is part of the strategy. TEAM 
            embarked on an acquisition earlier last year but after a detailed 
            evaluation felt that the deal would not add the required value. <br>

            new companies have entered the ranking of the best five dividend 
            yield companies. OMINVEST, Oman Flour Mills and Oman Oil are the 
            newcomers replacing United Power Company, Oman Refreshments, and 
            OIB. Shell Oman Marketing has jumped from the No. 5 spot last year 
            to the No. 1 spot and Areej Vegetable has slipped from No. 2 to the 
            No. 4 spot. <br>
            <br>
            The chairman of OMINVEST, Taya Bin Jandal Bin Ali, has stated in his 
            report to the shareholders that this is the company’s 20th year of 
            operations. The results of the company speak for themselves; good 
            profits have been earned over the years, despite frequent volatility 
            and turmoil in local and overseas markets and shareholders have been 
            rewarded by continuous and uninterrupted dividend payments. 
            Shareholders have, since inception, been paid cash dividends of 
            RO39.05 million (including the 2004 proposed dividend) against the 
            RO12 million capital contribution by them in cash in 1984 (RO8 
            million) and 1994 (RO4 million). The Company also issued a RO3 
            million stock dividend in 1997 which brought the paid-up share 
            capital to RO15 million. The shares, on the date of the report, are 
            trading at around RO 4.750, giving a value of RO71 million for the 
            company. <br>
            <br>
            An initial sum of RO100,000 invested by a shareholder in the company 
            at inception, with dividend re-invested in the shares, would be 
            worth approximately RO2.5 million now – an annualised return of 17.3 
            per cent over this period. Jandal adds that while this is an 
            enviable performance, the company is making every effort to improve 
            on it and to ensure that they continue to deliver above average 
            returns to shareholders without unduly raising the risk profile of 
            their investment portfolio. Jandal advises that most of their 
            founder shareholders have retained their shareholdings over this 
            long period. <br>
            <br>
            Jandal states that the group recorded a consolidated net profit of 
            RO7,637,413 (2003: RO7,007,222). In consideration of the good 
            results and to mark the 20th anniversary of the company, the board 
            is pleased to recommend a cash dividend of RO6,000,000, representing 
            40 per cent of the paid-up share capital (2003: RO4,500,000, 30 per 
            cent cash dividend). Jandal advises that buoyant oil prices and 
            increased government expenditure should generate favourable business 
            environment in Oman. <br>
            <br>
            The company is actively pursuing long-term projects in the tourism 
            and industrial sector but these will need to meet our exacting 
            financial criteria. Following two years of strong performance, 2005 
            is likely to be a tougher year for global equity markets in the face 
            of decelerating earnings growth, higher interest rates in the US and 
            economies affected by higher oil prices. Nevertheless, we would 
            expect the company to perform satisfactorily and to report a 
            profitable year in 2005, he says.</font></p>

            consider any other companies that do not make the list on the basis 
            of Revenues. In the case of banks, the Gross Interest Income as well 
            as Other Operating Income together is considered as their Revenue 
            for this purpose. All figures are for the year ended December 31, 
            2004, unless otherwise stated.<br>

            Assets shown are as per the balance sheet at the end of the year. 
            They are the total of Fixed as well as the Current assets.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Shareholders’ Equity</b><br>
            Shareholders’ Equity is the paid-up capital of the company, retained 
            earnings, and statutory and all other reserves as well as share 
            premium.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Market Capitalisation</b><br>
            Market Capitalisation figure has been arrived at by multiplying the 
            total number of outstanding shares of the company by the price per 
            share as of close of business on April 20, 2005. <br>

            <b>Earnings Per Share</b><br>
            The Earnings Per Share are as declared by the company in its 
            published financial statements.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Dividend Yield</b><br>
            The dividend yield figure is calculated on the basis of dividend 
            declared in the financial statements for 2004 against the share 
            price at close of business on December 31, 2004. At the time of 
            going to press, all the shareholders’ annual general meetings have 
            not taken place and the dividends recommended by the board of the 
            various companies are subject to the approval of the shareholders.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Price-Earnings ratio</b><br>
            This ratio has been calculated by dividing the Earnings Per Share 
            for the year 2004 by the share price on April 20, 2005. <br>
            <br>

          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OER: Could you identify the main reasons why NBO has had to make a RO30.5 million provision for loan losses?&nbsp;</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Aubyn Hill: </b> Just like the stock market, the banking industry does not operate outside the economy. Since the end of the first quarter in 1998, when oil prices hit a low of below US$10 (per barrel), the non-oil economy has had a very difficult time. The stock market, if you look at the trend line, has been one-way downwards. It’s the same situation that has now come to hit us. After three, four years of a slow economy or slow growth in the non-oil economy, and in some sectors no growth at all, you find that we’re making these provisions. Now that doesn’t preclude the fact that some decisions should have been made better. We can’t avoid that issue. But in a good and growing market, even weak decisions can survive. In a consistently down market, even good decisions face difficulty. So that’s the background.<br>
          Now why have we made this (provision)? Two names are responsible for more than 50 per cent of this figure. One is a local name - by law I can’t talk about names in particular, but I’m sure the market is so well informed that they’ll know who we’re talking about. Another is an oil-related name that has not done well. It has business in the three countries in which we operate, in Egypt, in Oman, and in Abu Dhabi.<br>
          You have to take about RO4 million out of that RO30 million for consumer provisions. Out of that (remaining) RO26 million, much more than half of the balance is from those two names. The rest, we have some smaller names here, they add up. And of course we have the devaluation in Egypt.&nbsp;</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OER: With hindsight, was the bank’s expansion into Egypt a mistake?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> We decided in 1994/95 to expand in Egypt. Those were good years. In fact, 1995/96, Egypt had a balance of payments surplus of US$19 billion. The Egyptian pound was increasing against the US dollar. Now in an economy like that, why wouldn’t you grow your business? But when it changes, you obviously have to pay the price.&nbsp;<br>
          We made a lot of money and we will continue to. We are committed to Egypt, we’ve just changed the direction of the business. The Cairo market has 12.5 million people. If we just cherry pick the best of the consumer business in Egypt…just under a million clients, we have all the business that we need. And I think that’s a business we understand and know thanks to our operations in Oman.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: Should NBO and other Omani banks have been more cautious when lending money during the 1990s?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH: </b> One of the things I keep saying to my board, in taking obvious responsibility as we go forward, is that it’s useless to explain a bad loan. A bad loan is a bad loan. It’s useless for me to tell you what were the circumstances when we made a bad loan. Because I can tell you, no honest person, okay, no sensible person puts a bad loan on the books of a bank. Every loan you put on is good when you put it on.<br>
          The system we have in NBO is one where a number of people look at loans at different levels in the bank. So a number of people…thought that these loans were good. This is not new money we’re talking about, these are clients we know. Circumstances change on them.&nbsp;<br>
          We should also put this year in context. We’ve had eight or nine years with great results, paying in six years RO47 million in dividends. So you know we’ve had a good run. This bank in the past 10 years has grown from an asset book of RO243 million to assets at the end of 2001 of RO951 million. That kind of geometric growth in your asset book means that you’re doing business, and in doing that business you’re taking risk. Lending money is a risky business. We’ve had a bad year this year. (But) once you put that in perspective, we have made obviously a lot of good loans.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: What measures have you taken to ensure that the bank does not continue to expose itself to bad loans?<br>
          </b><br>
          <b>AH:</b> Everything that you experience in life, whether it’s good or bad, you should learn from it. We think we’ve leant. We obviously have to monitor our clients much more carefully. It’s the basic stuff. The first thing is the account officers who handle credit, they have a completely different directive as to how they must handle it. It must be cash-flow based, we must have significant collateral, and there’s some business we don’t want. We have to be a lot more selective.&nbsp;<br>
          The biggest provision we had this year was audited by one of the biggest name firms in the world, not for one year but consistently for five or six years. About four or five years ago, we had that audit firm telling us clearly what the net worth and sales of the owner of that company was. And subsequently they’ve done all of the audits. Well when we sent in another audit firm to do the check after the problems happened, they said ‘look, there are questions here. How could they not do
          ABCD?’ So even though we have the outside firm checking, we have to be doubly careful.<br>
          But still, in the final event, you are lending money. It is risky. All of it will not come back to us. What we have to do is make sure we really rapidly and significantly reduce the amount that we have to take provision for.</font>

          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OER: You indicated at your result presentation press conference that you are looking at seeking legal redress from the firm that audited the books of one name in particular who owes you a lot of money.&nbsp;</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> I’m not indicating, I’m telling. We’re talking to our lawyers. As I said in the press conference, we don’t treat provision in this bank as a loss. Provision is an accounting arrangement that we have to do to report to our shareholders and investors and interested parties and regulators and so on. But as a management team we see provisions as something we have to go back and get. That means we will use every managerial step, every legal step possible, to get back our money from whoever we should get it from. If we were misled by bodies that we should not be misled by, and the clients who may have the money wherever they have it, we’re going to certainly try and find it.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: Most of the major banks have been stung by this one borrower.&nbsp;</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH: </b> I would say all the banks, local and foreign.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: We understand this person borrowed in excess of RO50 million from the various banks in total. It seems banks had a false impression of the size of his trade. But we understand that the amount he was borrowing far exceeded what would reasonably be needed to run the business he said he was involved with. Do you think that the banks should have asked more questions when lending such huge amounts of money to one individual?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> If it’s the name that I think you’re thinking of, it has been on our books since 1989. So we’ve built that relationship. New people who came, as late as 2000 actually, judged the name (to be) good. Because the name is probably going to be sub judice in a few weeks’ time, I wouldn’t want to comment more on it. Except to say yes, in hindsight you can see all kinds of issues.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: So more questions should have been asked?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH: </b> Obviously more questions should have been asked. But when you look at the development, it’s not something that happens to you one day.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: You’ve said before that too much lending is done on a ‘name’ basis in the region. In other words, ‘wasta’ works in banking just as it does in other spheres of Arab society. Is this a cultural practice that needs to change, not only in banking, but in business in the Middle East generally?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> I have worked in the region for the past 20 years, and certainly done business in all the GCC countries, and it is a cultural practice. You think of one big name in Saudi Arabia, in Kuwait and anywhere else, and you see a family behind it and generally still a man behind it. So it’s a natural phenomenon. It’s just less in the West.&nbsp;<br>
          What we have to do is now move to the place where these big names are now big businesses. Us banks must get across the message to them that ‘you’re no longer running just your private business, you’re taking money from shareholding institutions where people don’t know you, and these are shareholders who management and boards of banks are responsible to’. We want financial statements. Luckily, the Central Bank of Oman has led the way in the region and has now insisted that by the 31st of March, anybody who is borrowing from a bank RO250,000 or more must produce an audited financial statement, whether you’re an individual of a company or whatever you are. Now that’s an excellent move forward, and that’s going to help the banks. I think more and more central banks should do this.<br>
          Even then, we as bankers and lenders must obviously become a lot more judicious. We’re going to have to probably say a lot more ‘no’s’ than we have in the past. And that’s already happening in
          NBO. I’ve said very clearly that we are weeding out names that no longer fit the NBO risk profile.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: Do you believe this result marks the bottom of the cycle, and that NBO will return to profit growth this year?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> Yes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: Do you expect NBO to post a net profit for full-year 2002?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH: </b> Yes, we expect to post a net profit for the year.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: Does that mean a return to dividend payments this year?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> I would hope that would be the case. But I must also put a caveat there. UBS was going along wonderfully, and then September 11 happened. In the fourth quarter, Swiss Air went bankrupt. JP Morgan Chase and CitiCorp were doing wonderfully well, then Enron happened, then Argentina happened. We were going quite well with some clients here in 2001…things turned bad, we had to provide and we’re looking at legal steps in quick succession. So I say ‘yes’ to those questions. That’s our plan, our business plan looks that way, but I must put in a caveat.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: How do you feel about the losses, and do you personally accept any of the blame for them?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH: </b> As somebody who believes in the capitalist system, it’s a terrible place to be in where you do not pay dividends to your shareholders, (especially) when you’ve had a consistently good record and they expect you to pay dividends. And I hold 140,000 shares in the bank, I am one of those shareholders. So I feel personally as a professional terrible about not being able to pay a dividend, and personally as an investor in a terrible position. So yes, no doubt about it. And frankly this position is not where I expect to be at the end of this year. We have to get back to a place where we’re producing profits, and we hope dividends as well.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: So you shoulder responsibility for the losses?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH: </b> I am the chief executive officer of this bank. The first place, and very often the last place, where that responsibility has to rest, is in my office. I have to take that personal responsibility up front. Funnily, when you’re leading an
          organisation, all the blame is yours. As much as possible I share the credit.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: Have you considered hanging up your boxing gloves and stepping down as CEO?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> That would be, frankly, the easiest thing to do. I’m pretty sure with time I could get another job somewhere else. I’m willing to work hard and I think I’m decently intelligent. Somebody will, after time, employ me. And the board actually can make that call. I am employed by the board. You’re asking me my position – I have never left a situation where the circumstances were difficult. I don’t run away from problems. In fact, when I took over the bank (in 1991), the bank was effectively bankrupt. I was told by many of my colleagues in the banking industry that I was stupid to take the job. But the challenge was to take the bank from a state of bankruptcy. And now we have a net worth of over RO105 million, six years of paying dividends. Certainly we now have a problem, a problem that is much smaller than the one that I inherited when I took over the bank, it certainly is not the time to run away from it. I think I’m still in good health and we will work this out.<br>
          It’s the board’s call. I’m sure they will consider whether the experience we’ve given over the last 10 years, and especially last year, should be just put away or used to the benefit of the
          organisation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OER: A few days before you announced the loss you appeared on the front cover of another business magazine, which named you the best CEO in Oman. Do you agree with that assessment?</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>AH:</b> First of all what I will say is I didn’t choose myself. I understand that over 100 senior people made that decision. I’ll graciously thank whoever gave it. However, one of the things that we must remember is that it’s not easy for a CEO to go and face the press, the brokers, the analysts, the very day after the board makes the final decision on a loss. While we have stood up in good times we have also stood up in bad times, so maybe they know what they were saying.<br>
          <br>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>How important do you think is 
            CEO/MD succession planning for an organisation?</b><br>
            There is no doubt that succession planning is as important as 
            back-up planning. In my view, an organisation should be 
            ‘Person-Independent’ and ‘Process Dependent’. It is dangerous for a 
            company to revolve around an individual person’s abilities and 
            calibre because when that person leaves, there will be a vacuum that 
            may make the difference between success and failure.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Can you afford to retire tomorrow? Please explain.</b><br>
            There is no retirement age for work or business – only change of 
            activity. If I retire tomorrow, I would feel miserable. Rather, I 
            would prefer to venture into new areas of business activity after 
            ensuring that my existing business is on auto-pilot mode.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Is your company always prepared for a quick change at the top?</b><br>
            I must admit that we are not prepared for quick change. The 
            structure of our business systems in Oman, which is heavily 
            expatriate-dependent, makes it difficult for us to put into practice 
            quick change. At the most, we can have a temporary back-up plan, 
            which in due course could be used as a launch pad for quick change.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Do you have a successor(s) identified? Please explain.</b><br>
            Of course, I have my successor identified. It would naturally be my 
            best-fit son. But he will succeed only if he can compete and prove 
            himself as the best man for the job. As I mentioned earlier, my job 
            should be person independent and process dependent. I would rather 
            have an efficient non-relative successor rather than offer my job to 
            a relative-successor who is inefficient.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Do you have a strategy that will let you move on from your 
            company in the way that you want?</b><br>
            Yes, of course! In fact, one of the recent workshops I recently 
            attended (the Louis Allen Management Workshop) has a very simple 
            technique that can be applied which will enable you to take your 
            annual vacation at the same time ensure that the business runs 
            according to planned objectives set for the company. The same 
            principle can be applied to a situation when you move on from your 
            company.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What do you see yourself doing in 5 years? 10 years? 15 years?</b><br>
            My opinion is that personal vision should not be shared and is not 
            for public announcement. My strategic thinking will be shared with 
            those who share the same vision, goals and objectives. I have it all 
            chalked out.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What are your current thoughts about transitioning your business? 
            Would you rather pass your business on to the next generation or 
            sell it?</b><br>
            My energies will be directed towards transcending my business and 
            myself. This will be achieved by the conventional principles of 
            management, which is PLOC – Planning, Leading, Organising and 
            Controlling. My business belongs not to one generation. It is 
            intended that it survives the test of time and constantly innovates. 
            I will sell my interest at the appropriate time but my business will 
            definitely be passed on to the next generation – ‘Oman’s next 
            generation’!<br>
            <br>
            <b>Are you clear about who will own the business when you call it a 
            day? Who will run the business?</b><br>
            I am very clear – it will be run by professionals.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Are your children interested in continuing the business? Are they 
            qualified to do so? Please explain.</b><br>
            I do not want to pass judgement on the capabilities of my children 
            on a public platform. Their merits will be tested as they grow. I 
            will give them the opportunity.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Would you want your children to own and run the business or have 
            it be professionally managed?</b><br>
            I will encourage my children to own the business. But to run it will 
            depend on their management skills. Management is the key to running 
            any business. I believe that having it professionally managed will 
            ensure the success of the business.</font></p>

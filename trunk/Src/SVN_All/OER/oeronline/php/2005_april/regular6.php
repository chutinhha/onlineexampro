            I have a formal qualification in agriculture and animal production, 
            including a doctorate plus 18 years’ wide-ranging experience in 
            animal production encompassing planning and overseeing 
            implementation of projects and programs, conducting and supervising 
            research projects. I joined the Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries 
            in 1979 as Agricultural Engineer, and moved up as the Director of 
            Animal Wealth, Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, from 1991. Then, 
            in 1996, I joined Oman Agriculture Development Co. SAOG as Manager 
            of Livestock and Projects, and then moved on to Al Maha Petroleum 
            Products Marketing. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Please enlighten our readers about the management structure of 
            your company. </b><br>
            It’s basically a functional structure. We decentralised every 
            functional area decision-making to the respective functional head 
            and I mentor them, coordinate with them for reaching our 
            organisational objectives and goals.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What does your role in the company entail? </b><br>
            As I said, my role is to be a mentor and provide leadership to the 
            functional heads – be it finance, production, marketing, etc. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Briefly describe your management style. </b><br>
            I am basically a technical man. However, my role as a CEO of the 
            company is more to do with strategic management and man management. 
            Almost all of the operative functions are delegated to respective 
            functional heads. I believe in delegation of authority, inculcating 
            a sense of ownership to the company, being down to earth with all 
            the employees, etc. – these are the basic principles that I firmly 
            believe that create loyalty of the employees towards the company.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What are the challenges that your business faces in Oman? How do 
            you propose overcoming these challenges? </b><br>
            We are living in a Free Trade World now, which is a matter of 
            concern for local producers, because our cost of production, raw 
            material, etc. are quite high. We have cheap products from Brazil 
            and other countries being dumped in Oman and in the whole of the 
            Middle East. However, to be self-sufficient in food, we need 
            agricultural ventures like A'Saffa Poultry to provide the people of 
            Oman with quality food. <br>
            <br>
            Overcoming these challenges needs more than just producing 
            cost-effective products:</font></p>

            foremost, we have full support from the Ministry of Agriculture &amp;

            competing in terms of prices. We assure of delivering fresh products

            beef the preferred protein in Oman? How do you counter that inherent 
            disadvantage that poultry products, especially chicken, have here 
            vis-à-vis beef? </b><br>
            Beef is one of the preferred proteins in Oman – there is no doubt 
            about it. But belief systems are changing; awareness of health is 
            catching up with the young and old alike. Today, red meat is little 
            frightening for a middle-aged person and, in such a situation, 
            poultry is the best alternative with lean white meat. As I said, we 
            are educating the customers of the health benefits of poultry meat, 
            the freshness and the taste that our product provides the customer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I cannot say that beef stands a disadvantage to poultry products. 
            Poultry products have their own advantages, which other meat 
            products cannot provide, including the health benefits, easy 
            availability and the range, not to mention the economical price of 
            poultry meat as well.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Could you please throw some light on how A'Saffa maintains 
            hygiene standards while rearing poultry? </b><br>
            Bio-security is the highest priority for any poultry farm. Our plant 
            fully adheres to HACCP standards – we are currently working on 
            obtaining the certification. It is built according to international 
            standards and the equipment, technology and machinery used are fully 
            European. <br>
            <br>
            Our Bio-security measures start from the gates of our farm, where 
            every vehicle is sprayed with disinfectant, every individual working 
            in each farm has to adhere to a very strict bio-security practice. 
            Our farms are well separated from each other to counter any 
            exigencies or diseases. The chicken that are hatched are vaccinated 
            as per our standard programs, the buildings that they are housed are 
            washed and disinfected, the bedding material that is used are 
            fumigated before chicks are put in.<br>
            <br>
            Wherever there is a contact with the product, all workers use 
            gloves, head covers, masks, etc. RO water is used for washing and 
            cleaning of the chicken and is void of any contaminants. The 
            chickens are raised in free, cool environment and they are not 
            caged. We raise our chickens in a very natural way.<br>
            <br>
            Processing plant is washed daily twice – before and after completion 
            of the day’s job, they are washed using food grade detergents and 
            hot water using high pressure sprays. The products are handled in 
            hygienic manner with highest standards in production process. We 
            have about 30 tests conducted for every batch of chicken product 
            that comes out of our processing plant, thereby maintaining highest 
            quality standards that we can proudly call Omani Standard and Omani 
            Product Quality.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Which management gurus do you favour and why? </b><br>
            I do not follow any management gurus, but believe in continuous 
            improvement, what we call it 'Kaizen'. I fully believe that there is 
            always a better way of doing things that we are doing today. <br>

            business? </b><br>
            A business is like an individual – it is an entity on its own. If 
            you ask me which part of your body is most important, I can only say 
            everything is as important as the other. Do you remember the 
            story...that parts of the body disputing who is superior that we 
            studied when we were young?<br>

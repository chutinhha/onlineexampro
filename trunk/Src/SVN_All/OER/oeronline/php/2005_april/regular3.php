<b>Apple Computer backs Blu-ray </b><br>
Apple Computer Inc. announced last month it will join the Blu-ray format for 
next-generation DVDs, which is being supported by an alliance of companies led 
by Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. The Blu-ray Disc format is 
competing with the high-definition DVD format to become the major technological 
standard for next-generation DVDs. Toshiba Corp, NEC Corp and other companies 
developed the competitive HD DVD format. <br>
<br>
While current optical disc technologies such as DVD, DVD±R, DVD±RW, and DVD-RAM 
use a red laser to read and write data, the new format uses a blue-violet laser 
instead, hence the name Blu-ray. Despite the different type of lasers used, 
Blu-ray products can easily be made backwards compatible through the use of a 
BD/DVD/CD compatible optical pickup and allow playback of CDs and DVDs.</font></p>

PSP ready to battle Nintendo DS for leadership </b><br>
Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. announced an innovative marketing 
campaign to launch the PSP (PlayStation Portable) handheld entertainment system, 
which was to make its highly anticipated North American debut on March 24 at the 
time OER went to Press. <br>
<br>
The groundbreaking campaign demonstrates PSP as the first truly integrated 
portable entertainment product designed to provide a comprehensive entertainment 
experience—games, movies, music, photos and wireless connectivity—in one stylish 
device. The multi-million dollar integrated marketing effort includes 
television, print, outdoor and online elements, and non-traditional, original 
programs including PSP Radio and the first-ever PSP Accessories Show. <br>
<br>
The various executions of the campaign are designed to engage consumers by 
showcasing the incredible entertainment innovation that PSP represents, while 
also focusing on the human aspect of personal entertainment. The overall tone of 
the campaign is hip and urban, inviting consumers to break free from the 
constraints of the ‘‘handheld gaming ghetto.’’ </font></p>

disables Apple iTune restrictions </b><br>
A group of US and Norwegian programmers have joined forces to crack Apple’s 
digital rights management software when downloading iTunes. They have developed 
a program called PyMusique, which allows users to legitimately enter the Apple 
site and buy iTunes, but then strip out the blocks that restrict the use of 
those tunes. The software lets people purchase songs from Apple’s iTunes music 
store for the standard price of 99 cents, but also lets customers save those 
tracks on their computers before they are protected by digital rights management 
software, which prevents widespread file copying. <br>
<br>
Their move may arouse the wrath of the music moguls as well as Apple, which so 
far hasn’t said anything about its copyright system being breached. PyMusique 
was initially written for Linux users but has now been developed for Windows 
users too, presenting an even bigger challenge to the music industry. <br>
<br>
The programmers behind PyMusique are Travis Watkins, Cody Brocious and Jon Lech 
Johansen. Norwegian Johansen was responsible with others for bringing out 
software six years ago that allowed users to copy film DVDs. He successfully 
contested legal action brought against him in Norway for that software, which 
still circulates on the Internet. All three programmers deny that PyMusique 
breaks any copyright law or Apple's user contract rules. </font></p>

Nortel successfully test new mobile service </b><br>
South Korea’s LG Electronics has successfully tested a next-generation 
high-speed mobile phone service with its Canadian partner Nortel Networks. The 
trial runs on the HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access) service mark a new 
era of cell-phone users visually communicating, enjoying two-way games and 
watching TV while moving by car or train, it said. The live test calls were 
conducted at Nortel’s lab in France. According to sources, the HSDPA service 
will eventually ensure data transmission at a maximum speed of 14 megabits per 
second, which is about seven times faster than the mobile phone services now in 
use. </font></p>

Ericsson launches Roving Camera </b><br>
Taking pictures with your mobile phone is no longer confined to what is visible 
through the viewfinder on the phone. Sony Ericsson’s new Bluetooth controlled 
camera, ROB-1, can move around freely—forwards and backwards—steered wirelessly 
by the joystick or keypad on your mobile phone or as for P900/P910, with the 
touch screen, enabling you to see on your phone screen exactly what ROB-1 is 
looking at. You can then capture these images using your phone just as you would 
a normal photo. <br>
<br>
The ROB-1 can rove around for a distance of up to 50 metres from the user, 
streaming video to the phone’s display. The device’s three wheels and spherical 
shape combined with clever camera technology to make it agile and flexible with 
a wide field of vision. Eleven centimetres in diameter, ROB-1 can move forwards, 
backwards, look around corners, pivot on the spot or tilt the camera 70º upwards 
and 20º downwards. So, the next time you see some bright lights at about the 
height of your ankle, you’d better watch out! </font></p>

Sultan Telecom introduces Samsung SGH-D500 in Oman </b><br>
Last month, Samsung Electronics, in association with Mustafa Sultan 
Telecommunication Co LLC, launched the first digitally converged mobile handset, 
the SGH-D500 in Oman. Senior officials from Samsung Gulf Electronics and Mustafa 
Sultan Telecommunication Co LLC were present at the launch along with top Indian 
models Malaika Arora Khan and Niketan Madhok. <br>
<br>
The 1.3-megapixel camera not only allows users to take pictures, but also gives 
them creative freedom with the availability of embedded special effects and 
emoticons. Its 128 MB (96-MB user free) dynamic shared memory supports and 
expands users’ business capabilities, allowing people to store megapixel images, 
capture 60 minutes of video, save MP3 or AAC songs or record up to 6 hours of 
voice. With a variety of synchronisation options, the D500 supports e-mail 
Client, vCard and vCalendar for quick information transfer. It has advanced MMS, 
Java and GPRS capabilities as well as USB interface and SyncML DS. </font></p>

<b>AFP slaps $17.5 million copyright infringement lawsuit on Google </b><br>
This news should be a warning for those out there who interpret copyright to be 
the right to copy! French news service Agence France Presse (AFP), which charges 
users for browsing through its content, is suing Google for copyright 
infringement. Media reports say AFP is seeking damages of $17.5 million (RO6.73 
million). <br>
<br>
Interestingly, Google News includes only the headlines on its service but not 
the entire news story. What it does is supply a link to the story to the 
original Website for people to read. In fact, AFP could have mitigated its 
claimed damages simply by putting up a subscription page requiring online 
payment for the new audiences. </font></p>

<b>Reading novels on mobiles </b><br>
In Japan, tens of thousands of cell phone subscribers are now reading 
full-length novels on their cell phones. Amazing? You bet! The people have 
become so advanced in mobile technologies that it is common routine to read 
email, news headlines, weather and sports all through the cell phone! The novels 
are provided by several mobile Websites, ranging from classic novels to best 
selling, etc. Even the fact that only a few lines of text appear on the cell 
phones doesn’t discourage the Japanese people to keep on reading full length. Is 
it time to launch OER Mobile?</font></p>

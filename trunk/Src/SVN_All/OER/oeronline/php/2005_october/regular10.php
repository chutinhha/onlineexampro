            General Manager of Energoprojekt Entel L.L.C, in an interview with

            <b>Please tell us about your career trajectory.</b><br>
            I began my career with Energoprojekt Entel in the consultancy field 
            in 1979 at the company’s headquarters in Belgrade. Over the years I 
            have worked in different countries, including Libya, Algeria, 
            Serbia, Yugoslavia, Qatar and now Muscat. I have also had the 
            opportunity of opening new branches of my parent company in a few 
            countries. <br>
            <br>
            <b><br>
            <br>
            Tell us about Energoprojekt’s entry into the Middle East market and 
            the work you do.</b><br>
            The company headquarters are located in Serbia and Montenegro. We 
            came to the Middle East region in 1991 when we bagged a huge power 
            transmission consultancy contract in Qatar. It set the ball rolling 
            for our operations in Qatar. Once we settled there, we decided to 
            eye neighboring countries for feasible opportunities. Oman was 
            destination next as the country has a lot of potential. A firm in 
            Oman wanted our consultancy services in power transmission. So we 
            set up operations here in 1997. One contract led to another and soon 
            we were getting a lot of clients in Oman. <br>
            <br>
            The Ministry of Electricity and Water was one of our clients. This 
            year, we have taken on more electricity projects. The other areas 
            where we offer our consultancy services are in waterpower 
            transmission and wastewater recycling. We also have clients in 
            Buraimi, Sohar and Shinas. PDO is another client that works closely 
            with us on their power projects. In wastewater and desalination, we 
            received our first contract from The Oman Wastewater Company. In the 
            Gulf region, we also have opened our offices in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What kind of work culture does your company follow? </b><br>
            We open local offices in all the countries where we offer 
            consultancy services. But our way of working is different. While 
            working on projects in a country, we generally tend to employ our 
            own staff from the parent company. We rarely employ new staff, as 
            training them for the different projects we undertake is difficult 
            As soon as a project is over, the staff return to our parent company 
            in Serbia and Montenegro. <br>
            <br>
            We know our staff well and they are highly qualified personnel. We 
            know their strengths and their capabilities. If it is possible to 
            send a particular project over to our headquarters, then we do that 
            also. The advancement of technology allows us that freedom. We are 
            particular about providing the best possible services to the client 
            in a fast and efficient manner, which has been our trademark.<br>
            <b><br>
            What are your responsibilities in the company?</b><br>
            As the General Manager, I am responsible for all the operations in 
            the company. I have to find new projects, execute the work along 
            with my staff, attend to the needs of the personnel and employ local 
            staff in the required areas of specializations. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Can you briefly describe your management style?</b><br>
            I have worked with most of my staff in Oman earlier, when I was in 
            Qatar and Belgrade. I insist on establishing proper engineering 
            procedures. It is very crucial to our operations. I am also 
            particular about the personnel should having complete knowledge of 
            their areas of interest. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What challenges has your company faced in Oman? And how have you 
            tackled them?</b><br>
            Challenges are part of any business and are present in any country. 
            We have faced minor challenges here but we have emerged successful. 
            Some of the challenges we have faced in Oman are rather small 
            compared to those we have encountered in some other countries. What 
            helps us to get over our challenges is that the business environment 
            in Oman is good. You tend to get support from all the vital sectors 
            here.&nbsp; </font></p>

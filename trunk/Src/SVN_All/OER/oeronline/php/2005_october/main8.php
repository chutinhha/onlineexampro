General Manager of Intercontinental Muscat talks to OER about his new innings as 
GM in the Sultanate<br>
            </b><br>
            <b>
<img border="0" src="atth.jpg" width="180" height="186" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">Please 
tell OER about your career graph</b><br>
I was born in Northern Italy and studied at the hotel school of Stresa. I have 
been associated with InterContinental since 1973; I joined InterContinental 
immediately after completing my hotel school studies. I initially started in 
Food and Beverage department before deciding to go into Accounting a few years 
later. My last job in finance was as Regional Director of Finance, Indonesia and 
Australia. However, after that stint, I moved into Operations and became the 
Executive Assistant to President for North and Latin America operations. I 
subsequently became Resident Manager in IC Rio di Janeiro. My first job as the 
General Manager was at Le Vendome Intercontinental, Beirut. I have now arrived 
in Oman after completing a three-year stint at Regency InterContinental Bahrain. 
This is my 15th move with Intercontinental.<br>
<br>
<b>Please share with our readers about the management structure of your hotel</b><br>
There is a general manager and general executive manager. I have a group of 
executives under me who are in charge of their respective areas such as 
Marketing, Food and Beverage and Human Resources. <br>
<br>
<b>What are your responsibilities in the hotel?</b><br>
My responsibilities include safeguarding the assets of the hotel, which includes 
its reputation, ensure the hotel’s profitability and the safety of the hotel 
employees, guests and visitors. I would also like to play a role in the 
development of the hotel employees for the future. <br>
<br>
<b>Can you briefly describe your management style?</b><br>
I don’t see myself as someone who is here to give orders. I see myself more of a 
coach and facilitator to the employees and executives. I would like to hope that 
they can learn and benefit from me. I expect the executives and department heads 
to be professionals as well as be aware of their responsibilities. I would like 
to assist and facilitate them into achieving their goals. <br>
<br>
<b>In your opinion, what qualities define a good manager?</b><br>
I feel that a good manager should be knowledgeable, accessible and fair but 
firm.<br>
<br>
<b>What is your opinion about the hospitality industry in Oman? Is the Sultanate 
ready to open its doors to tourists?</b><br>
I feel that Oman has the most potential in the Middle East for tourism. In the 
Middle East, Oman stands out with its combination of natural beauty, culture and 
heritage. I feel that it is a well-kept secret that people are only now 
beginning to become aware of. It is great to see that Oman is building up a good 
portfolio of hotels especially as Oman is undergoing such rapid development. <br>
<br>
<b>Which management gurus do you favor and why?</b><br>
I read a lot of different books by different management gurus so it is hard to 
mention any one particular person. I imbibe different aspects from different 
people. I would like to say that reading these gurus is definitely food for 
thought and it assists you in making decisions in the relevant circumstances or 
situations.<br>
<br>
<b>You have been in Oman for just two weeks. What is your opinion of Oman and 
its people?</b><br>
Actually, I was earlier here for a brief vacation in 2004. I had even mentioned 
to my wife that this is a place that I would not mind working in! Of course, at 
that time, I wasn’t aware that I would be coming to work over here. I found it 
to be very hospitable and warm. I also felt that it was very safe and ideal for 
raising a family. <br>
<br>
Oman has an unique combination of natural beauty, culture and heritage; most 
countries have one or the other but Oman is blessed to have all. I also like to 
indulge in photography and Oman offers much to be captured. n</font></p>

                    presented the Historical Association of Oman (HAO) with two 
                    grants from the Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation. 
                    “We are delighted to be supporting Oman’s unique heritage by 
                    funding two important projects,” Ambassdor Baltimore said. 
                    The first project will enable the HAO to conduct a survey of 
                    Bowshar village to make a database of archaeological and 
                    historic sites, including location, condition and history. 
                    The second grant will fund the HAO as it completes an 
                    architectural, historical and cultural analysis of Bilad

                    The trade relations between the Sultanate of Oman and 
                    Thailand have grown at a healthy rate. According to Ahmed

                    Thailand amount to RO31.7 million. The non-oil exports in 
                    2003-2004 to Thai ports increased by 122 per cent while 
                    imports increased by 30 per cent. Exports to Thailand in the 
                    last five years have increased at an average of 19 per cent,

                        <b>Oman to attract more FDI</b><br>
                    Oman is expected to further liberalise its economy to boost 
                    foreign direct investment (FDI) in a major way. Maqbool bin 
                    Ali Sultan, Minister of Commerce and Industry informed, &quot;We 
                    are luring foreign investors, and the Ministry of Commerce 
                    and Industry (MOCI) is for reforms in foreign investment 
                    laws as easing of foreign investment regulations will 
                    attract a large number of investors and help them explore 
                    tremendous opportunities.&quot; <br>
                    He added that on an average, Oman’s nominal GDP had grown by 
                    six per cent in the period 1991-2000. The economy grew by 
                    more than 14 per cent in 2004 compared to 6.9 per cent in 
                    the previous year. To continue the march forward, he 
                    cautioned that the Sultanate has to meet the challenges on 
                    two fronts – economic diversification and the development of 
                    human resources. Diversification of the economy, he said, is 
                    government's priority.<br>
                    <br>
                    He further added, “Oman's commitment to the WTO has led to 
                    further liberalisation of the economy, paving the way for 
                    increased opportunities for foreign investments. Investment 
                    opportunities in real estate projects such as the Barr Al 
                    Jissah Resort, the Wave and the Blue City will also play a 
                    key role in liberalising the economy further.&quot;</font></p>

                        <b>Buyer-seller meet at Dar-Es-Salaam</b><br>
                    In co-ordination with BankMuscat, OCIPED organised a 
                    buyer-seller meet at Dar-Es-Salaam in Tanzania on 29 
                    September. The meet was organised in association with 
                    International Trade Centre (ITC), UNCTAD and WTO, with the 
                    target of getting a minimum of three buyers for each 
                    identified Omani product for the event. Nisreen Ahmed 
                    Jaffer, Acting Director General of Export Development, 
                    OCIPED said: “An Omani business delegation comprising 19

                    trading on MSM </b><br>
                    The Capital Market Authority (CMA) is contemplating 
                    permitting trading in certificates of deposit (CDs) on the 
                    Muscat Securities Market (MSM). The initiative, if 
                    implemented, is expected to boost the market growth. 
                    Abdullah bin Salem Al Salmi, Chairman-MSM &amp; Executive Vice 
                    President-Regulatory Affairs, CMA informed, “We are in the 
                    process of allowing trading in CDs on the MSM. The issue is 
                    under discussion with different stake holding authorities. 
                    CDs will provide the investor community with an opportunity 
                    to trade a new instrument.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    A notification allowing trading in CDs in the next 3-4 
                    months is expected. Currently, only equities and bonds 
                    trading are allowed in the market. The initiative is 
                    expected to give further fillip to the market which is 
                    already on a high in the last year, especially after the 
                    listing of Omantel shares.</font></p>

promotions. But marketers still wonder why some promotions hit the mark and 
others don’t? </b> <br>
<br>

Loyalty programmes present a valuable mechanism for retailers and their supplier 
partners to build long-term affinity with customers. The resulting data that 
these programs generate provides a vast resource for understanding shopping 
behaviour and developing targeted programmes and communications. While direct 
mail has become a typical way to tailor offers to specific customer groups, 
customer insights can also be used to drive other types of more traditional 
retail promotions such as features in weekly circulars and POS (point of 
sales)-triggered coupon offers. Incorporating customer data into decision making 
for activities which make up the vast majority of promotional activity can 
change the dynamics of retailing by focusing attention on customers and their 
needs—rather than on categories or brands.<br>
<br>
<b>Building the basics to succeed</b><br>
In an increasingly competitive marketplace, companies that use their loyalty 
programs to establish a deeper relationship with their customers are better 
positioned to prosper. Two foundational factors are especially important within 
any loyalty scheme: <br>
<br>
1. Maintaining good customer data with insights, which can be easily distributed 
throughout the organisation for decision-making<br>
2. Developing a business culture that constantly looks for ways to improve 
programmes that benefit customers by applying shopper insights. <br>
<br>
Creating a process for gathering insights, testing programs and learning about 
customer response is important. While a few interesting facts about a 
cardholder’s household composition might come from the initial card application, 
such information and even deeper insights may also be derived by capturing sales 
history and assessing information about customers from transactional-level 
purchase data. Sales data not only tells an analyst about additional family 
members in a cardholder’s household, but it also identifies opportunities to 
target the household more uniquely through a better understanding of preferences 
for specific categories, products and brands to satisfy the special needs of a 
child or any other household member. <br>
<br>
Increasingly sophisticated models also enable analysts to understand why 
customers shop, how they shop, what they buy and how sensitive they are to 
various price structures. If properly collected and assessed, sales data can 
point out everything from pets in the home to family health and nutrition needs. 
Analysis of the data becomes one way to answer those burning business questions: 
What do customers want? How can I keep them shopping in my stores instead of the 
competition? And what opportunities exist to increase sales? <br>
<br>
<b>Commitment is a key </b><br>
The data, analysis, and decision-making are only as good as the commitment by 
business leaders to continuously apply the insights to developing programme that 
positively impact customer behavior. This kind of transformational change and 
the impact it has on the enterprise takes time. If leadership embraces the use 
and application of customer data, the business will follow. Organisational and 
structural changes are required to re-align goals and incentives or develop 
planning processes that focus on the customer. The end result, however, works.
<br>
<br>
<b>Revealing customer-focused insights</b><br>
One example of a retailer, well known for rewarding it best “Platinum Fans” 
customers, wanted to use its loyalty card programme to further build customer 
affinity and grow sales. By all accounts, this grocery chain has earned some 
measure of success—achieving over 85 per cent of sales on card by reinforcing a 
message of customer value, targeted offers, and special services. These loyal 
customers received periodic special in-store gift cards and coupons presented to 
them directly by the store manager for maintaining high loyalty thresholds. But 
leadership within the organisation realised the need to understand customers on 
a deeper level and wanted insights and analysis that identified which promotions 
worked for which customer segments and why. Promotions within three normal 
business activities were assessed to understand how customers in certain 
segments were impacted. <br>
<br>
Analysis of featured-item promotions from the front page of a weekly circular 
yielded insights about the promotion’s incremental impact on category, total 
grocery department, and total chain sales. In one example, a major laundry 
detergent was promoted at $9.99 (with no minimum spend limit) in one week and 
again at US$8.88 (limit one with a US$10 purchase) in another week. A comparison 
of sales by customer segment for each promotion showed that the second item 
promotion was able to drive additional positive performance among all shoppers. 
Specifically, the lower-priced item, even with the limit, was a key driver of 
significantly higher sales — especially among typically lower-spending and 
less-loyal shoppers. In this case, the increased sales within the category and 
total grocery department significantly offset the margin reduction from the 
discounted price. <br>
<br>
The complete analysis of front page item promotions offered category managers, 
marketing and supplier partners with recommendations to consider when selecting 
advertised specials. In general, feature items promoted in the weekly circular 
appeared to have a better impact for: Higher price items, longer purchase cycle 
items, planned purchase/fixed consumption items, many products at the same price 
point, less loyal customers. While the advertising circular appeared to be a 
good mechanism for driving visits into the store, product selection is important 
in order to optimise the impact of this marketing activity. <br>
<br>
<b>Matching rewards win </b><br>
A second analysis of direct mail promotions targeted toward highly engaged and 
highly loyal shoppers (in terms of spending and trip frequency plus Spectra 
Share of Wallet) underscored the importance of matching relevant offers to 
customer groups. <br>
<br>
In this example, reward mailers were sent to specific customers in the 
“Platinum” segment including “Fans,” “Loyals” and “Switchers in each of four 
separate months (See end of article, Building a Loyalty Segmentation). Analysis 
revealed that the highest percentage of lift in trips was among the less-loyal 
switching segment: 12 per cent to 19 per cent increase for “switchers”, compared 
to 3 per cent to 6 per cent for “Platinum Fans”. This approach was effective in 
driving less-loyal customers into the store and could be used tactically for 
situations where there is high competition. Of the four promotions, month one 
was the most effective, delivering nearly $500K incremental dollars with little 
drop off after the promotion. Combining the targeted mailing with a seasonal 
event (such as Easter) was even more effective since it captured the spend 
uplift and did not simply bring forward future transactions. </font></p>

<b>Coupon redemption cashes in</b><br>
A third analysis in the series investigated the redemption of point-of-sale 
coupons and the impact on incremental sales. One of these coupons featured a 
discount of $2 off any produce department purchase of $10 or more. The campaign 
generated a great response driving incremental visits at the store, department 
and category level. Incremental trips to the store were up nearly 10 per cent, 
while trips to the department increased by nearly 15 per cent. Leadership was 
particularly pleased as this promotion helped communicate its overall marketing 
message of the store. As with the featured item promotion in the weekly 
circular, this type of promotional mechanism was particularly good for 
increasing visit frequency for less-loyal customers. While not all the POS 
coupons delivered the same results, the lessons learned by testing ideas and 
refining the communications or targeted offers led to refinements of future 
promotions. Loyalty programmes can provide customer insights, which can be 
applied by both the retailer and the supplier for better decision making when 
developing targeted programs or communications. <br>
<br>
<b>Building Loyalty Segmentation</b><br>
Any segmentation must meet two important criteria to be effective. It must 
accurately describe and define customers within distinctive groups. It must also 
enable the targeting of customers with promotions to influence shopping behavior 
and measurement of behavioral changes. A loyalty-based segmentation is useful 
for assessing customer engagement with the store and monitoring changes in 
spending patterns. </font></p>

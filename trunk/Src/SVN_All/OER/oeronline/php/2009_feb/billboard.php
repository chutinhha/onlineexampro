                  Oman Environment Day, which was held recently, saw fourteen 
                  supermarkets join forces with the aim of reducing plastic bag 
                  usage in the Sultanate, as part of the ongoing efforts of the 
                  Environment Society of Oman’s (ESO) “Say No to Plastic Bags 
                  Campaign”. The supermarket campaign was the latest initiative 
                  by the ESO, with the support of Oman LNG, to educate consumers 
                  on the effects of plastic bags on the environment. The 
                  Environment Day provided the platform to persuade Oman’s 
                  consumers to either reuse their plastic bags or opt for 
                  reusable jute bags. Furthermore, the free distribution of jute 
                  bags in each of the fourteen outlets on the day, meant all 
                  customers were given the opportunity to ‘go green’ at no 
                  additional cost.<br>

                  published by the end of the year. Like his previous two works, 
                  it consists of sections, each one an exploration of emotions 
                  and ideas every living being can identify with. In this 
                  compilation of recent and earlier unpublished work, the poet 
                  speaks from his heart to express the universal language of 
                  desire and joy, sadness and heartache.<br>

                  Profits from the sales of ‘In the Dimmest of Light’ will go to

                  its fifth anniversary. On the occasion, Sheikh Salim bin 
                  Abdullah Al Rawas, Omanoil Chairman, said, “Omanoil’s growth 
                  over the last five years has been remarkable. It now has a 
                  nationwide marketing presence with the Retail Business Unit 
                  expanding to over 110 filling stations and 50 QuickShops 
                  strategically located across the Sultanate. As a visionary 
                  company, we renew our promise today to our loyal customers and 
                  remain committed to playing a vital role in the development of 
                  our beloved nation.” Since its inception in 2003, Omanoil’s 
                  net annual profit has grown rapidly. Total assets have risen 
                  year on year and revenue growth has largely been achieved 
                  through increased sales. Share of the retail market has also 
                  risen with substantial direct sales to both the government and 
                  commercial sectors especially due to the growth of major 
                  construction and infrastructure projects.</font></p>

                  to date, and the continued strong interest shown by the

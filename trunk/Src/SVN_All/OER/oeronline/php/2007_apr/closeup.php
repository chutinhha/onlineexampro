<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Bahrain moves to benefit from its FTA with the US, both directly and with other 
countries<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="closeup.jpg" width="145" height="281" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is now on in full swing. Bahrain is 
making every possible effort to get the most out of the accord that went into 
effect in August 2006. <br>
<br>
In March, Bahrain’s crown prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa led a 
delegation of executives and officials to a series of business meetings in the 
city of Chicago. This marked the first time that the Crown Prince had personally 
presided over a visit to the US dedicated to promoting the FTA deal. Later, the 
delegation continued the second part of its journey by visiting Houston in the 
state of Texas for the same purpose.<br>
<br>
To be sure, Bahrain’s interest in the FTA with the US does not come from a 
vacuum. Rather, the authorities in Manama appreciate potential benefits of the 
deal with respect to Bahrain’s economy, notably job prospects. The US-Bahrain 
FTA removes trade barriers related to goods and services and encourages 
investments between the two countries. <br>
<br>
<b>Advantages to Bahrain’s economy<br>
</b>The FTA provides numerous benefits to Bahrain including getting access to the 
world’s largest GDP and import market. Other benefits include enticing 
investments from American and other enterprises, besides encouraging authorities 
in Bahrain to streamline certain labour and business laws. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="13" height="11" align="absbottom"><b>Access to the largest economy</b>: The American economy is by far the largest in 
the world and accordingly can accommodate any increase in exports from Bahrain. 
American gross domestic product stands at US $ 13,000 billion. In contrast, 
Bahrain’s GDP amounts to less than 1 per cent of the US’ GDP. <br>
<br>
According to the US Census Bureau, American imports of goods and services 
amounted to US $ 2,201 billion in 2006, registering a 10.5 per cent growth in 
comparison to 2005. Also, total exports of goods and services from the US stood 
at US $ 1,439 billion, up 12.8 per cent from 2005. Thus, the US trade deficit 
amounted to US $ 764 billion, undoubtedly the highest in the world. <br>
<br>
According to statistics published by the US Census Bureau, US-Bahrain bilateral 
trade amounted to US $ 1,123 million in 2006, with Bahrain maintaining a surplus 
of nearly US $ 142 million. In 2005, bilateral trade had amounted to US $ 783 
million with Bahrain enjoying a smaller surplus of US $ 81 million. Clearly, the 
FTA has allowed Bahrain further unrestricted access to the US market. Bahrain’s 
goods exports to the US comprise apparel and clothing accessories, aluminium, 
fertilisers, organic chemicals, mineral fuels and oils, plastics, and electrical 
machinery. Conversely, US exports to Bahrain focus on aircraft, machinery, 
vehicles, pharmaceutical products, toys, games and sports equipment apart from 
agricultural exports like poultry, snack foods, cotton, processed fruit and 
vegetables. </font>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="13" height="11" align="absbottom"><b>Streamlining laws to entice American businesses</b>: The FTA is expected to 
increase American investments in Bahrain. According to the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), worldwide outward foreign direct 
investment (FDI) stood at US $ 916 billion in 2005. The US contributes some 30 
per cent of global outward FDI. <br>
<br>
Aware of the potential benefits, Bahrain authorities showed a readiness to amend 
laws deemed essential to attract possible American investments. In fact, the 
American side had insisted that the FTA could not come in force unless the 
Bahraini side was prepared to amend legislations extending protection to 
intellectual property rights (IPR), together with specific penalties against 
violators. Bahrain now hopes that some US firms would use Manama as a gateway 
for doing business in the GCC region and beyond.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="13" height="11" align="absbottom"><b>Opening up prospects</b>: Booz Allen Hamilton, an American consulting firm, 
believes that the FTA opens up opportunities for six sectors of Bahrain’s 
economy. These are: <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="13" height="11" align="absbottom"><b>Attracting investments</b>: There is also likely to be a spillover effect with 
Bahrain enticing FDI and other forms of investments from other countries. The 
reasoning cited is that the amended laws and improved business environment would 
assist the authorities in marketing Bahrain worldwide. According to UNCTAD, 
inward FDI to Bahrain amounted to US $ 1,049 million in 2005, up from US $ 865 
million in 2004.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="13" height="11" align="absbottom"><b>Upgrading 
labour laws</b>: Bahrain agreed to update all labour laws in compliance 
with International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards. For example, Bahrain 
officials are required to ensure that school-age children are barred from 
working. Also, the Bahraini government has taken up responsibility to verify 
that labour laws do not discriminate against foreign workers in any way. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="13" height="11" align="absbottom"><b>Liberalising business regulations</b>: The FTA has purportedly convinced Bahrain 
authorities to streamline the business environment at large. These measures 
include reducing charge for new or renewal of commercial registration to BD 20 
per annum for most business activities (excluding financial services). More 
recently, the authorities made two extraordinary decisions, serving the needs of 
consumers and companies. One such law requires firms to post prices of products 
in the most visible way. The law applies on all retail outlets including small 
shops selling vegetables. The other provides commercial enterprises the right to 
engage in sales activity at anytime without seeking any permission. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="close1.jpg" width="13" height="11" align="absbottom"><b>Improving chances of EU-GCC FTA</b>: The argument goes that the US-Bahrain FTA 
(together with subsequent deal with Oman) played a part in convincing the 
European Union to clinch a deal with the GCC. In retrospect, the EU and GCC 
signed a framework for entering into talks on establishing a free trade area in 
1988. However, the European side kept pressing GCC states to comply with new 
demands, including environmental protection. However, the deal could be signed 
later this year if the GCC states agree to EU request of scrapping cap on 
foreign ownership of business. At the moment, the GCC has in place a 49-per cent 
foreign ownership of firms. <br>
<br>
<b>Lengthy process</b><br>
In fact, Bahrain had to go a long way before meeting US requirements for 
implementing the deal. In retrospect, formal FTA negotiations started in Bahrain 
in January 2004. Representatives of the two countries succeeded in working out 
details of the agreement in only five months. The deal was formally signed in 
Washington in September. <br>
<br>
Yet, legal experts spent several months translating the text from English into 
Arabic. For its part, Bahrain completed endorsement process of the deal in July 
2005. Still, the US Congress only endorsed the deal in December. Nevertheless, 
the FTA deal proved popular in the House of Representatives and got an 
overwhelming majority (327 yes to 95 no votes). It is believed that the Congress 
supported the FTA with Bahrain partly because it posed no threat to American 
farm industry.<br>
<br>
President George W. Bush signed the agreement into law in January 2006. However, 
implementation was delayed until August till Bahrain satisfied American 
requirement on laws governing intellectual property rights. <br>
The US-Bahrain FTA went into effect in August 2006, nearly two years after the 
clinching of the deal. But, it marked the first time that the US had implemented 
such an accord with any GCC state. Oman became only the second GCC country with 
which the US has signed a separate FTA.<br>
<br>
In short, the FTA provides prospects for Bahrain to address economic challenges, 
notably maintaining some occupations and creating new job opportunities stemming 
from prospects of increasing exports to the US market. Unemployment, which 
stands at more than 10 per cent, is the main economic challenge facing Bahrain.
<br>
<br>
For the US, the deal increases opportunities for exporting numerous products, 
and of course the American cause of achieving a regional free trade by 2013.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%" bordercolor="#111111">

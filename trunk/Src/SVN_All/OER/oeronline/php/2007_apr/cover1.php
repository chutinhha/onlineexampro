<font face="Verdana" size="1">Globally, in 2005, foreign direct investment recorded a growth for the second 
consecutive year. Inflows increased substantially in 2005 to reach US$916 
billion, a growth of 29 per cent and this on the back of the 27 per cent growth 
recorded in 2004. Inward FDI grew in all the main sub-regions, in 126 out of the 
200 economies covered by the United Nations Conference on Trade &amp; Development 
(UNCTAD). In some regions, the growth was unprecedented. Nevertheless, world 
inflows remained far below the 2000 peak of US$1.4 trillion. <br>
<br>
During 2005, global FDI outflows amounted to US$779 billion (this variance 
between inflows and outflows is due to differences in data reporting and 
collecting methods). Developed countries remained the leading source of such 
outflows. In 2005, the Netherlands reported outflows of US$119 billion, followed 
by France and the United Kingdom. However, there were also significant increases 
in outward investment by developing economies, led by Hong Kong (China) with 
US$33 billion. Indeed, the role of developing and transition economies as 
sources of FDI is increasing. Negligible or small until the mid-1980s, outflows 
from these economies totalled US$133 billion last year, corresponding to some 17 
per cent of the world total.<br>
<br>
Similar to trends in the late 1990s, the recent upsurge in FDI reflects a 
greater level of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), especially among 
developed countries. It also reflects higher growth rates in some developed 
countries as well as the strong economic performance of many developing and 
transition economies. M&amp;As rose by 39 per cent in value terms in the first half 
of 2006 over the same period of 2005. But the current cross-border M&amp;A boom is 
partly due to the activities of private equity and hedge funds. However, if FDI 
growth is due to such investments, rather than on investments by transnational 
companies, it is not certain how long it will continue.</font></p>

<b>Inspiring Confidence<br>
</b>Looking at prospects by region, a number of recent surveys confirm the growing 
importance of the Asian economies, in particular West Asia, as FDI destinations. 
The FDI Confidence Index shows unprecedented levels of investor confidence in 
emerging markets, led by China and India. Choosing among emerging markets, 
respondents to the 9th Annual Global CEO Survey carried out by Pricewaterhouse 
Coopers said they are investing the most in China, followed by India, Brazil and 
the Russian Federation. Other fast growing economies (Indonesia, Mexico and 
Turkey) are also at the top of the list of the most preferred locations. FDI 
prospects for Eastern European nations are also bright, but are less favourable 
for Africa and Latin America as a whole. Also, AT Kearney’s FDI Confidence Index 
reveals that investors have lost confidence in Western Europe other than the 
United Kingdom due to increasing competition from emerging markets and 
protectionism.<br>
<br>
<b>FDI in West Asia</b><br>
West Asia saw a historic growth in FDI flows in 2005-both inward (US$34 billion) 
and outward (US$16 billion). The growth rate of inflows in the region was the 
highest in the developing world for the second consecutive year. Similarly, 
outflows from the region more than doubled. Economic growth, high global oil 
demand, a favourable investment environment and economic diversification efforts 
were the main factors behind this growth. This is even though there were some 
concerns about geopolitical uncertainties in some parts of the region.</font></p>

<b>Inward FDI: Unprecedented Rise<br>
</b>FDI flows into the 14 West Asian countries rose by 85 per cent in 2005, reaching 
a record US$34 billion. Similarly, the share of West Asia’s inward FDI in total 
inward FDI in Asia and Oceania was the highest since 1985-over 17 per cent. Its 
share in all developing countries’ inward FDI also increased, from 7 per cent in 
2004 to 10 per cent in 2005. Again, FDI as a percentage of gross fixed capital 
formation (15 per cent) surpassed that of Asia and Oceania as well as of all 
developing countries for the first time in 2005.<br>
<br>
Several factors explain this high growth. First, the region experienced strong 
economic growth, spurred by production increase due to high commodity prices. 
During the period 2003-2005, the GDP growth rate averaged 7.4 per cent in eight 
West Asian countries, compared to 5 per cent for the developing world as a 
whole. This raised the region’s GDP per capita, which was already high. 
Large-scale greenfield investments and cross-border M&amp;A deals were facilitated 
by the booming local economies and prospects of continuing high prices of oil 
and gas. <br>
<br>
FDI in downstream activities in the oil and gas industries has also been spurred 
by a rise in world demand. Also, the business climate has become more favourable 
following the good performance of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members. 
Again, liberalisation efforts continued to gather momentum in the region, with 
the increasing privatisation of services (telecommunications, water and energy 
supply, and banking). <br>
<br>
Finally, foreign affiliates in the region improved their performance. This sent 
a promising signal to potential investors. FDI inflows to West Asia in 2005 were 
spread unevenly among the region’s economies, being concentrated in Saudi 
Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The Islamic Republic of Iran and 
Yemen failed to attract more inflows, mainly due to increasing geopolitical 
uncertainty.<br>
<br>
The United Arab Emirates was the largest recipient of FDI in West Asia, with a 
record US$12 billion mainly going to the country’s 15 free trade zones. Turkey 
followed, with a few mega deals that included the privatisation of Türk Telekom 
and two deals in the banking sector. <br>
<br>
Although developed countries continued to be the main sources of FDI, the year 
also increasing inflows from the developing world. It is noteworthy that such 
FDI is increasingly intra-regional, specially in services, and is concentrated 
in a few countries. Cross-border M&amp;As in West Asia saw a historical increase 
from US$0.6 billion in 2004 to US$14 billion in 2005. Intra-regional M&amp;As 
accounting for 65 per cent of the total value and 30 per cent in terms of 
numbers played an important role in this growth.</font></p>

<b>Outward FDI: Petrodollars Boost
Investment<br>
</b>Surging oil prices and increased foreign exchange reserves have made West Asia 
an important source of FDI outflows, notably by the State-owned investment firms 
of oil-exporting States such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
Emirates. In 2005, outward FDI flows rose to US$16 billion, compared to US$7 
billion in 2004. For the first time since 1990, outflows from the region 
surpassed those from ASEAN member States. This was mainly because outward 
cross-border M&amp;As, mainly in services, increased 12-fold. The oil-producing 
countries are increasingly investing abroad, specially in services and 
oil-related manufacturing. This phenomenon of “petrodollar recycling” is in 
sharp contrast to the one in the 1970s and 1980s, when portfolio investment 
dominated. <br>
<br>
Private-equity and institutional investors from West Asian countries have 
invested in various areas, sometimes through large-scale investments. For 
example, Kingdom Holding, the Saudi State owned company which has been an active 
private-equity firm since the 1980s, targets not only blue-chip shares and 
luxury hotels in developed countries, but also emerging firms in developing 
countries, including in Africa. In Bahrain, Investcorp and Arcapita Bank use 
their private equity arms to purchase majority shares in companies in Europe and 
the United States. <br>
<br>
<b>Sectoral Trends</b><br>
FDI data for the region by sector are scarce. However, available data suggest 
that West Asia’s inward and outward FDI flows are highly concentrated in the 
services sector. FDI in manufacturing has also been taking place, for instance 
in textiles, as well as in areas related to oil and gas. <br>
<br>
In the case of inward FDI, the shift towards services is in response to 
increasing liberalisation, whereas the rise of FDI in manufacturing is mainly in 
downstream activities (part of manufacturing) since FDI in upstream activities 
in the energy industries is not allowed in most West Asian countries. In 
response to increasing global demand, countries are trying to attract FDI in 
downstream activities related to natural resources to increase production and 
improve productivity through advanced technologies.</font></p>

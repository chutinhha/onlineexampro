<br>
        <img border="0" src="carnews3.jpg" width="200" height="126" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The Nissan Pathfinder has earned Euro NCAP’s (European New Car 
        Assessment Program) highest award–a 5-star safety rating for side-impact 
        (front and rear seat) crash-test safety. A recently released study by 
        Euro NCAP ranks the new Nissan Pathfinder as one of the safest SUV 
        vehicles in the market for adult occupant protection. The Pathfinder 
        scored well in all three categories tested, passenger safety, child 
        safety and pedestrian safety, ensuring that it won the rank of being one 
        of the safest SUV vehicles available. The Pathfinder scored 32 points, 
        while the average score for the same vehicle category is 28 points. The 
        Nissan Pathfinder incorporates the Nissan Safety Shield approach to 
        safety. It includes rigorous crash testing, over 50 standard safety 
        features on every vehicle, available advanced safety technologies, and 
        child safety to help protect both drivers and passengers. <br>

        <br>
        <img border="0" src="carnews2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Designed to vaguely resemble classic British sports cars, the 2007 
        Chrysler Nassau concept car claims to do 0-60 in 5.1 seconds, making it 
        phenomenally quick for a car with a 120-inch wheelbase. The Chrysler 
        Nassau concept is, according to Alan Barrington, principal exterior 
        designer, “a more emotional and artistic articulation of what it means 
        to be a Chrysler. Traditional exterior proportions have been enhanced 
        with a silhouette that recalls the classic English ‘shooting brake. This 
        provides SUV-like interior volume with a lower, more roadworthy 
        physique. In order to attain a more compact appearance, the Nassau has 
        deliberately concise front and rear overhangs, with the body surface 
        wrapped around the large 10-spoke 21-inch wheels.” He added that the 
        Chrysler Nassau concept was created to form the effect of a classic 
        sculpture–an artistic approach with a shapely flowing of lines that give 
        the impression of movement even while standing still. The Chrysler 
        Nassau concept’s profile line draws down and into the tail lamp, leading 
        the eye of the observer toward to the dramatic back end which creates 
        its unexpected ‘shooting brake’ appearance. <br>

        driving feel, more power with improved, segment-leading fuel economy, 
        increased interior refinement and improved quietness. Among its key 
        features is a new 360-degree safety system of occupant protection and 
        crash-avoidance technology–a system which highlights GM’s commitment to

        wheels features an all-new elegantly handcrafted interior, a new sports 
        look and a six-speed transmission on Northstar V8 equipped models, all 
        of which take the luxury sport crossover to new levels of refinement. 
        The instrument panel and door trim are built using Cadillac’s new 
        ‘cut-and-sew’ interior process that combines advanced technology with 
        the hand-rendered expertise of expert craftsmen. The vehicle’s new 
        cockpit is hand built in the same painstaking fashion Cadillac applies 
        to the limited-production STS-V and XLR-V models. <br>
        <br>
        SRX’s in-vehicle electronics and entertainment package has also received 
        a major enhancement for 2007. The renowned Bose 5.1 Digital Surround 
        system is available as an option for the first time on SRX, while the 
        Bose system previously optional on the SRX now becomes the standard 
        audio package. SRX will offer a “theatre” package consisting of Bose 5.1 
        Digital Surround, DVD navigation and rear seat DVD entertainment.<br>

        Express Rent-A-Car LLC recently added seven Mazda6 sedans to their fleet 
        after purchasing the cars from Towell Auto Centre LLC, the national 
        dealers of Mazda. <br>
        <br>
        After test-driving sedans from most of the major car brands, Mazda6 was 
        the preferred choice as it fulfilled all requirements of Express 
        Rent-A-Car with its class-leading features. The major reasons why the 
        Mazda6 was chosen over any other, was its comfort, quality driving 
        dynamics, high-end craftsmanship and excellent road holding and 
        cornering ability. “When it comes to choosing a fleet car very few cars 
        can compete with the Mazda6 on parameters like design, safety, 
        boot-space, ride quality, running cost, maintenance cost and residual 
        values. A lot of competitive car brands in this segment offer a lot but 
        very few can offer all this in one package,” says Formose Pereira,

        <br>
        Bridgestone Corporation has earned a name for itself as one of the 
        world’s leading tyre companies that produces a wide range of tyres using 
        the most sophisticated technologies, the most popular being its Run Flat 
        Tyres (RFT). <br>
        <br>
        Bridgestone RFT comes into immediate effect in the instance of pressure 
        loss, keeping the vehicle under control and avoiding potentially fatal 
        situations. Bridgestone RFT enables passengers to continue driving in 
        comfort and safety for a certain distance at a specified speed after a 
        puncture. RFT are increasingly being fitted on premium cars. RFT removes 
        the need to carry a spare tyre, reducing weight and offering the end 
        user more storage space and the car manufacturer more design 
        opportunities. Incidentally, Bridgestone Motorsport is the official tyre 
        supplier to FIA Formula 1 World Championship for the present year 2007 
        as well as for 2008, 2009 and 2010. The decision was recently announced 
        by the sport’s governing body, the Federation Internationale Automobile 
        (FIA). <br>

        detailing, which results in significantly improved aerodynamics. All

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
China is likely to allow foreign companies to issue yuan-denominated bonds on 
domestic markets this year. Citing a top central bank official. Wu Xiaoling, the 
vice-governor of the People’s Bank of China, the China Securities Journal 
reported that the central bank was in favour of foreign companies and 
international organisations issuing yuan-denominated bonds in China. Supervisory 
authorities would not reject applications from institutions registered in China 
as long as the companies were engaging in legitimate business operations, Wu 
said. Foreign companies and international organisations currently must transfer 
foreign exchange into China from abroad when they need capital for domestic 
investment purposes. The World Bank’s International Finance Corp and the Asian 
Development Bank are currently the only foreign entities allowed to issue 
yuan-denominated bonds in China. <br>

The European Union has banned most of Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA) 
fleet from flying to the 27-nation bloc while it has lifted restrictions on two 
other carriers that had previously been blacklisted. The EU executive said only 
PIA’s seven Boeing 777s will be allowed to fly to the region, confirming a 
Reuters report in February. The rest of the airline’s fleet of 42 planes will be 
blocked for safety reasons.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

<br>
A consortium of UK bank HBOS and property magnate Tom Hunter has said it had 
agreed to a takeover of Crest Nicholson, valuing the UK housebuilder at around 
£715 million (US $ 1.4 billion). Castle Bidco said it would pay 620 pence per 
share in cash for each Crest share and a final dividend of 9.7 pence per share 
would be paid by Crest. Castle Bidco said the offer represented a premium of 
10.2 per cent to 571.5 pence per Crest Nicholson share, the closing price on 
November 9, the day before Crest said it had received an approach. Crest said 
talks with the consortium were continuing, as the deadline for a takeover bid 
was pushed to early March and reiterated it would recommend a 620 pence per 
share bid, but there could be no certainty an offer would be made. In January, 
Crest said Castle Bidco had been considering making a £700-million cash offer at 
620 pence per share, along with the right to the final dividend of 9.7 pence a 
share. </font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

<br>
China will soon be threatening major Western aircraft makers, Boeing boss James 
McNerney said in an interview to German weekly Der Spiegel. Warning that it was 
wrong to think that there would only ever be Boeing and Airbus in competition, 
McNerney was quoted as saying, “The Chinese have well-trained people, a strong 
spirit of enterprise and an enormous domestic market.” McNerney said the US 
manufacturer had learned its lesson after failing to heed the threat from its 
European rival. “We were market leaders and we went to sleep, instead of staying 
wide awake,” he added. Asked about Airbus’s current problems, stemming in part 
from difficulties with its giant A380 airliner, McNerney said the two companies 
had different views of where the market lay. “We believe the future is with 
smaller aircraft capable of flying long distances between medium-sized cities, 
rather than in the development of large hubs” favoured by Airbus, he said. But 
McNerney added that the A380 was “a marvellous airplane, very exciting from a 
technological view.” </font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

<br>
Iran, Pakistan and India are considering a plan to begin construction of the US 
$ 7.23-billion gas pipeline by September 2009 on a segmented basis to ward off 
possible US-laws aimed at punishing oil companies that deal with Iran. “Each 
country will build the pipeline in the respective territories and in fact Iran 
has already started laying pipeline from Assaluyeh to Iran Shehr to serve its 
Eastern parts that would be extended about 200 kilometres to Pakistan border,” a 
senior official in the Pakistan’s petroleum ministry has said. Distance between 
Iran Shehr to the Pakistan border is about 200 km. He said a tentative schedule 
for the implementation of the pipeline has also been agreed upon envisaging 
completion of the project between June-September in 1914. However, he explained 
that Pakistan will construct the 655 km pipeline in its territory on the build, 
own, operate and transfer (BOOT) basis. For this, the government will appoint 
lead sponsors immediately after signing of the gas sales and purchase agreement 
with the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) by June 2007.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

<br>
Inspired by the famous American “green card” scheme, the European Commission is 
considering introducing its own “blue card” system to attract more qualified 
immigrants. An impact assessment is currently being drawn up and will be ready 
“in the next two months or so” after which the Commission will draft detailed 
proposals, EU justice spokesman Friso Ascam Abbing has said. He admitted that EU 
member-states hold differing opinions over legal migration but added that 
“everyone understands immigration will be part of the solution to the aging 
population. “We had better manage immigration properly as it is going to happen 
anyway,” he said. The “blue card”–taking its name from the EU flag, blue with 
gold stars–”would allow holders to move around the EU,” EU Immigration 
Commissioner Franco Frattini said. “Today if a multinational wants to move an 
engineer from a non-EU country from Rome to Brussels, they have to go through 
visa procedures, get a residency permit, a work permit,” explained Frattini, who 
plans to present a formal proposal on the matter in September. </font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

<img border="0" src="scan2.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Coffee giant Starbucks Corp is bitter about Indian entrepreneur Shahnaz Husain’s 
plans to start a chain of coffee cafes called Starstrucks in India, a newspaper 
has reported. The Seattle-based multinational chain filed a complaint with 
India’s Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trademark saying the name is 
deceptively similar to its own. Starbucks operates over 13,000 locations 
worldwide and is planning to open its first cafe in India this year. Husain, who 
is known as India’s herbal queen and owns the country’s leading company in field 
of beauty and anti-ageing treatments, vowed that she would stick to the name. 
‘Why should I give it up? There is nothing wrong with it,’ she told the paper. 
‘Hundreds of others are deceptively similar. What to do? They have opposed and 
we will fight,’ Husain added.<br>

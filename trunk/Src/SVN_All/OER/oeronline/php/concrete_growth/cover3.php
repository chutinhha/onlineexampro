            <b>The recent boom in construction industry, especially pipelines, 
            roads, ports and sewerage projects, has helped to increase the 
            demand for earthmoving equipment in the country. Dealers of major 
            excavator and highway tipper manufacturers are all cashing on the 
            rapid growth in demand for earthmoving equipment. </b><br>
            <br>
            <b>
            <img border="0" src="cov7.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="132"></b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="3">A</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">ccording 
            to industry sources, the excavator market has achieved a phenomenal 
            100 per cent growth last year and the trend is likely to continue in 
            the next three to four years. This is in view of a phenomenal growth 
            in infrastructure, industrial and tourism ventures, including the 
            Barr al Jissha Resort, Sohar Aluminium, The Wave, Sohar Port 
            expansion, Sohar Refinery, a portion of Quriyat-Sur road and the 
            first phase of Muscat Sewerage station. These are in different 
            stages of planning and implementation in different parts of the 
            country. <br>
            <br>
            Unlike many other countries, the demand for excavators is more in 
            the Sultanate in view of the peculiar topography of the country, 
            which consists of hilly terrain and very hard rocks. This calls for 
            an excavator-hammer combination to break mountains without 
            explosives for initial civil work. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cov8.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="140" height="203">Although Omani market is relatively small in terms of sales volume, 
            all major global players are actively competing to enhance their 
            slice of the market. The major equipment players include 
            Caterpillar, JCB, Komatsu, Volvo, Hitachi, Xcmg . The vehicles &amp; 
            tippers are by Hino, Man and Mercedez-Benz &amp; Steyr. The products of 
            these companies include bulldozer, motor grader, hydraulic 
            excavator, wheel loaders wheeled excavators, compactors. The 
            authorised dealers believe that the volumes are likely to improve 
            further once some of the mega projects, like The Wave, reach the 
            implementation stage, which is expected within a year. However, the 
            demand for mining equipment (large earthmoving equipment) is 
            relatively low compared to construction equipment in the country, 
            mainly due to the fact that mining is yet to assume large 
            proportion. Presently, few cement manufacturers are carrying out 
            mining activity for their raw material requirements. <br>
            <br>
            It may be noted that the multinational companies that bagged 
            projects in Oman prefer to hire earthmoving equipment rather than to 
            go for outright purchase. This has resulted in a further thrust to 
            machine hiring business. Entrepreneurs, who invest relatively 
            moderate amount, can buy these machines with the help of finance 
            companies with the intention of hiring it to large contracting 
            companies. This phenomenon has also resulted in better demand for 
            lease and hire purchase businesses. To avoid risk, it is preferable 
            to maintain a few machines than a large fleet with the company. This 
            would not only enhance efficiency in utilization of machines but 
            also create gainful employment opportunities for Omani nationals.
            <br>
            <br>
            The important aspect for marketing earthmoving equipment includes 
            the quality of the machine. With an equal importance given to dealer 
            after sales support and machine availability being the two most 
            important aspects as lack of service support could delay projects, 
            leading to huge losses to the companies. Reliability and ease of 
            operation are other key ingredients.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cov9.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="200" height="138">Many companies, when buying earthmoving equipment, go by the price 
            and credit terms and ignore maintenance cost or the productivity of 
            the machine. This clearly indicates the customer ignorance about the 
            maintenance cost of the machine. In fact, the customers do not 
            attach any importance to the hidden cost, which is a significant 
            factor in determining the cost of operation over a period of time. 
            It is also important to know the productivity of the machine in 
            terms of either ton or cubic metres of earth moved for rial Omani 
            for either out right purchase of a machine or hiring a machine. The 
            purchaser should estimate operating and owning cost of the machine 
            before going for outright purchase or hiring a machine. Like other 
            developed markets, the local companies will have to take into 
            account productivity of the machine rather than merely considering 
            the price and credit extended by finance companies or suppliers. In 
            this connection, the dealers will be in a better position to brief 
            potential customers on operating cost of each machine, which would 
            help them to choose the right equipment. With the marketing showing 
            remarkable growth, these aspects will be crucial factors in the 
            coming days. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cov10.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="138" height="136">At the macro-level, the growth in government expenditure is an 
            important factor that will decide the development of infrastructure 
            projects and thereby the demand for earthmoving equipment. The 
            estimated government expenditure during the current year is up by 
            7.5 per cent at RO 3,680 million. As the government gives special 
            emphasis on development projects, the investment expenditure is at 
            RO 867 million. It is expected that the government expenditure will 
            give a fillip to the private sector as the business activity in a 
            country like Oman depends on the government spending. A number of 
            development activities, including infrastructure projects, are at 
            the implementation stage and RO 238.2 million has been allocated 
            during the current year for speedy implementation of these ventures.

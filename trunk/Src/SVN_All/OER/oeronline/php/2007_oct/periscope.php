<b>A plunge in the Fed’s overnight borrowing rate could provide a steroid shot 
for Asia’s stock market valuation, making Asia the easy money superstar of 2008, 
forecasts Matein Khalid<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="periscope.jpg" width="134" height="213" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">With the exception of Shanghai A shares in China, Asian stock indices were 
victims of the credit crunch and subsequent trauma on Wall Street. The negative 
correlation of Asia to risk aversion was anchored by the unwinding of the 
Japanese yen carry trade, whose greatest beneficiaries were the stock markets 
and currencies of Southeast Asia, India, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and 
South Korea. Asian stock markets were also hit by the forced selling of hedge 
funds, particularly FDI driven bourses such as South Korea, Taiwan and India. 
While LBO debt in Asia is miniscule, a number of Asian banks have invested in 
subprime and CDO securities, led by the Bank of China’s US$9.8 billion exposure 
and DBS’s US$2 billion exposure. <br>
<br>
Of course, Asian stock markets are also vulnerable to recession risk in the US, 
which can prove catastrophic for the export growth led, open economies of the 
Pacific Basin. However, while the credit crunch is unquestionably a deflation 
shock to the US economy and recession risk is not at all marginal, the Federal 
Reserve will do its best to pre-empt any softness in the US consumer and payroll 
data. This means the Fed will be forced to revert to easy money policies to bail 
out Wall Street’s merchants of leverage and speculative excess; akin to its 
policy response during the New York banking crisis of 1991, LTCM/Russia in 1998 
and the collapse of the tech bubble in 2000.<br>
<br>
<b><img border="0" src="periscope1.jpg" width="350" height="214" align="right"></b>Yet the plunge in the Fed’s overnight borrowing rate could provide a steroid 
shot for Asia’s stock market valuation. In essence, just as Nasdaq techs became 
the world’s favourite asset class after the Fed’s easy money gift in 1998, Asia 
could become the easy money superstar of 2008. Valuation multiples in Asia are 
certain to rise despite epic events such as the collapse of the Silicon Valley 
tech bubble, 9/11, SARS, the Iraq War and a tripling in crude oil prices. The 
fact also remains that the Asian Pacific stock indices have outperformed the 
MSCI All Country World Index. Asian Pacific markets are no longer dirt cheap 
(with the exception of Thailand) but they are not particularly expensive either 
at 14 times forward earnings. Moreover, the domestic demand momentum in the 
Pacific Rim coupled with an entirely novel change in the consumer spending and 
borrowing paradigms suggests that 14 times 2008 earnings is a modest price to 
pay for exposure to some of the world’s fastest growing economies.<br>

<b>Cultural positives</b><br>
In retrospect, the Asian FX and stock market meltdown of 1998 marked one of 
history’s legendary bottom fishing opportunities. The Asian crisis also spawned 
a culture of risk aversion that ensured that companies de-leveraged their 
balance sheets, bankers became prudent in extending credit, and consumers 
boosted savings rates. In fact, the psychology of risk aversion in Asia was a 
diametric opposite to the credit bubble and leverage mania that swept Wall 
Street since the late 1990s. It is, therefore, no coincidence that foreign 
investors have driven the rally in Asian equities. This trend will probably rise 
as sovereign wealth funds in the GCC, Russia and China all seek to access the 
world’s most explosive secular economic growth story. Of course, it is entirely 
possible that foreign ownership will trigger excessive volatility in Asian 
shares, as we witnessed in August. Yet, foreign buyers will also lead to an 
incremental rise in Asia’s valuation metrics relative to the SP 500, Europe and 
the Emerging markets as it attracts domestic liquidity still invested in low 
yielding bank accounts. This is the reason I expect a cut in the Fed Funds rate 
and a fall in US Treasury bond yields to be a positive signal for Asian 
equities.<br>
<br>
Mutual funds, commercial banks, pension funds and insurance companies are still 
nowhere near excessively invested in their home markets and their holdings in 
fixed income and money markets instruments are far too excessive. For instance, 
Thai mutual funds have US$3 invested in the bond market for every US$1 invested 
in equities.<br>
<br>
Most Asian national provident fund and pension fund schemes have only 20 per 
cent investment in their local stock market. Both South Korea and Taiwan have 
announced strategic allocations to local equities in the years ahead.<br>
<br>
<b>Bank indicators<br>
</b>Asian banking systems exhibit some of the lowest loan to deposit ratios in 
the emerging markets. Moreover, even though the Fed and the ECB have engineered 
sharply higher interest rates since the summer of 2004, Asian three-month money 
markets rates are among the lowest in the world, less than 1 per cent in 
Thailand, and less than 3 per cent in Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and the 
Philippines. This excessively low risk free bank deposit rates are also a 
compelling argument to accumulate Asian equities. Moreover, as Asian property 
prices rise and home mortgage finance becomes ubiquitous, it is entirely 
possible that a greater proportion of Asian savings will be reallocated from 
bank deposits or money markets into equities.<br>
<br>
China’s stock market bubble, paradoxically, camouflages the prudent risk 
aversion of non-PRC Asian investors. Of course, it is important to note that the 
Middle Kingdom, with its closed capital account, was never assailed by the 
1997-1998 Asian financial meltdown. China’s negative real interest rates and 
lack of pension scheme also encourage speculative behaviour. Yet, even the mania 
in Shanghai A shares has a potential spillover impact on other Asian stock 
markets, not just on Hong Kong red chips and H shares. This is because the 
Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme will lead to Chinese 
money flows into the Asian stock markets. The corollary also holds true to a 
certain extent. A collapse in the Chinese A share market will have ominous 
implications for the Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index.<br>
<br>
The bullish case for Asian equities must also incorporate China’s new 
willingness to use its trillion dollar central bank reserves to invest in higher 
risk securities offshore. China’s US$3 billion pre-IPO stake in Blackstone and 
China Development Bank’s agreement to finance Barclay’s bid for ABN Amro 
demonstrates Beijing’s willingness to emulate Singapore’s Temasek model. After 
all, Asian central banks reserves (not including the Bank of Japan) at US$3.5 
trillion are far in excess of any war chest needed to defend undervalued, not 
overvalued currencies. As Asian governments reduce their colossal holdings in US 
Treasury bonds, the potential for a secular rating in Asian equities only rises. 
Asia’s stock markets are still correlated to Wall Street for now. But Asian 
valuation metrics are headed significantly higher in the decade ahead. This is 
the decade of the Asia Bull! </font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

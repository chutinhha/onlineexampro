<img border="0" src="southafrica.jpg" width="250" height="262" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">A recent brand equity study has valued Brand South Africa at US$74billion, up 
from US$52 billion in 2003. This figure is a measure of the selling power of the 
South African brand, that is, its ability to attract foreigners to the country’s 
products, industry and shores. <b>South African Ambassador to Oman, HE Yacoob Abba 
Omar</b>, explains how South Africa changed from the polecat of the world because of 
Apartheid to a world wide recognised brand.<br>
<br>
In 1998, the South African government wondered why it was not enjoying dividends 
from its “miracle”. South Africa became an independent state in 1994 led by 
President Nelson Mandela. However, it was not enjoying the increase in 
investment and tourism we thought we should have.<br>
<br>
The government decided, after looking at a number of successful country branding 
experiences, to embark on promoting South Africa in an integrated and co-ordinated 
way. This meant ensuring that all the government departments and levels 
collaborated. The departments of Finance, Tourism, Trade and Industry and 
Foreign Affairs alongside the promotion bodies of the nine provinces and the 
major cities were all jostling for the attention of the international market.<br>
<br>
It was also felt that since the private sector benefited from and contributed to 
the South Africa brand that it was essential to have them involved. This led to 
the creation of the International Marketing Council (IMC). The IMC was 
established in 2000 to create a positive, united image for South Africa. Using 
the slogan, “South Africa: Alive with Possibility”, the IMC’s mission is to 
articulate a brand for South Africa in order to attract tourism, trade and 
investment into the country.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="guest1.jpg" width="250" height="322" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">A vital part of the campaign was to get South African to be committed to the 
brand. Personalities such as President Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu 
and current President Thabo Mbeki were enlisted to champion the brand. A number 
of measures were used to promote the brand amongst South Africans. This was 
essential so that the entire nation could be seen to be living the brand, which 
was being used to attract tourists, investors and buyers of our goods and 
services. <br>
<br>
For example, in conjunction with the South African Coin Exchange, the IMC 
launched a competition on its web portal and on radio stations to encourage 
South Africans to suggest new ways to celebrate our heritage. The winners each 
received a silver Democracy coin valued at US$250, which features a collage of 
South Africa’s national symbols. In addition, the IMC supported a number of 
campaigns initiated by other organisations, such as National Be Positive Day. 
The Caring Nation campaign was conceptualised to capitalise on the prevailing 
festive mood in December when South Africans celebrate Christmas and New Year. 
The campaign was used to amplify the brand value “Caring Nation” by focusing on 
what South Africans can do to help others and the sharing of compelling facts on 
the country.<br>
<br>
In the process of amplifying Brand South Africa messaging, the IMC aligns itself 
with events of specific organisations, their programmes and initiatives. Some of 
the tactical opportunities seized upon are :</font><ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Creating a downloadable ‘Alive with Possibility’ logo for cell phones. The link 
was posted on the web portal for South Africans and friends of South Africa – 
both locally and abroad to share. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The Grammy – award winning group Ladysmith Black Mambazo used Brand South Africa 
messaging and rhythm during their European tour in June 2004. They also wore 
Brand SA t-shIrts and tattoos and distributed the SA Story Booklet.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The Brand SA logo was painted on the roof of the Sci-Bono Discovery Centre, 
which is visible from the M1 Highway in Johannesburg – one of the busiest 
stretches in South Africa. This initiative led to a flood of requests from 
property owners to put the logo on their rooftops as well. This campaign is 
on-going. The branding of roofs is being negotiated in other parts of 
Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The IMC has a number of tools to address international audiences. It developed 
adverts which can be seen in key media such as CNN, the BBC, and magazines such 
as Fortune and The Economist. Also country managers have been appointed to the 
USA, UK and India. Pele, the Brazilian soccer legend, visited South Africa in 
September 2004 and the IMC awarded him Brand Ambassadorship at Sun City. 
Furthermore, the campaign built on a successful visit to South Africa by London 
cab drivers by branding ten London taxis.<br><br>The IMC appointed Dr. Hischam El-Agamy, Director of Corporate Development for 
the prestigious International Institute of Management Development (IMD). Dr. El-Agamy’s 
appointment is strategic, as he enjoys unusual insight into the competitiveness 
of nations and is well positioned to use his platforms to give a credible view 
on South Africa. The following countries have asked the IMC to share their 
experience: Brazil, India, China, Kenya, Tanzania and Botswana.<br><br>The IMC tracks research on the impact of its work. It found that an 
extraordinary 93 per cent of adults South Africans said: “I am proud to be South 
African”. Eight percent said they were willing to do whatever they could to help 
make South Africa a better place, and two thirds said: “When I am with people 
who try to run South Africa down, I use my positive knowledge of the country to 
give them a better picture.”<br><br>Internationally, it has conducted perception audits. Of note is that while just 
7 per cent of foreign importers would consider the South African brand when 
buying from the country in 2003, this figure has increased to 10.7 per cent. For 
investments, the figure has shifted from 27 to 35.4 per cent while for tourism 
the figures have increased substantially from 50 to 74 per cent. This has seen 
South African tourism rise from about 600,000 in 1993 to about 7 million in 
2005. <br><br>Says Yvonne Johnston, CEO of the IMC: “In 2003, we were the first country in the 
world to do a brand evaluation. This study gives us a benchmark against which 
future brand improvements may be measured.<br>
<br>“It will also allow us to evaluate any improvements in the perception of the 
South African brand post the massive marketing opportunity that the FIFA 2010 
World Cup allows the nation.<br><br>“It sets a yardstick to see if gains made for the World Cup are being sustained 
in the future.”<br>
<br>The South Africa Nation Brand Valuation report uses the BrandMetrics tool to 
value brands. This tool was developed in 1999 by two professors based at the 
University of the Witwatersrand. In five years, BrandMetrics has completed some 
330 valuations for some of the world’s biggest brands.<br><br>The IMC also runs a Communication Resource Centre which monitors all the major 
international media – newspapers, radio and TV stations. It issues a daily 
bulletin of global coverage as well as a weekly analysis. It has a daily 
teleconference with government departments to work out responses to development 
in the media.<br><br>Perhaps one of the best indicators of the IMC’s impact can be seen by the number 
of visitors to SA’s information portal: www.southafrica.info. Launched in 2002, 
it has almost 2 million visitors per month from 157 countries.<br><br>Furthermore a number of companies and organisations have been involved as brand 
champions. The IMC inducts the management and staff, getting them to appreciate 
the essence of the SA Brand: The range of enterprises includes tour operators to 
insurance companies. <br><br>Having such a strong brand to work from has made my work as an Ambassador a lot 
easier. From the beginning of my term in Oman in September 2003 until now I have 
found that we have benefited from the promotional efforts of the IMC. </font>

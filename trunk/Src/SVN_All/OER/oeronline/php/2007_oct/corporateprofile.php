Global giant in the making<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<b>Salalah-based petrochemical and plastics company, Octal Holding is set to 
become the largest player in the world in its segment and contribute US$500 
million to Oman’s export revenue. OER uncovers the story behind the making of 
the global leader</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="corporte.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Three years ago, Chemlink Capital Ltd and Pound Capital Ltd, both US based 
private investment firms specialising in downstream petrochemicals projects, 
were exploring for a suitable base market for their new projects. Their search 
ended when their research analyst hit upon www.ociped.com, the website of the 
Omani Centre for Investment Promotion and Export Development (OCIPED). Soon 
after, Chemlink’s President Nicholas P. Barakat landed in Oman and after several 
rounds of talks with OCIPED, Mohammed Al Theeb, Deputy Chief Executive Officer 
at Salalah Free Zone Company, took him down to Salalah to convince him of the 
benefits of operating a profitable business from Salalah. He confirmed 
availability of land and utilities which would enable Octal to build its 
investment rationale fast track. After discussions with various ministries and 
other trade bodies and companies, Barakat decided to set up shop in Oman. <br>
<br>
As a result, Octal Holding, with 70 per cent foreign investment (from Chemlink 
Capital and their overseas partners) and 30 per cent Omani investment (from 
BankMuscat, Suhail Bahwan Group, National Investment &amp; Fund Co., Muscat 
Overseas, Oman Investment Company, Malatan Trading &amp; Contracting and Oman &amp; 
Emirates Investment Holding Co. SAOC and Dhofar Investment &amp; Real Estate 
Services Co. LLC.), got the go-ahead from the government in May 2006. BankMuscat 
was also the financial advisor to the project globally. Moving at a very fast 
pace, the company imported the machinery from Europe and started operations in 
the first week of December 2006 at Salalah Free Zone. The total investment in 
the project was US$300 million. Fluor Corporation, the world’s largest publicly 
owned engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance services companies, 
is the technology advisor to Octal and the project manager also.<br>
<br>
The company’s objective? Secure a 20 per cent share of the amorphous 
polyethylene terephthalate (APET) sheet, which in 2006 was worth US$2.25 billion 
and is considered one of the largest and fastest growing polymer applications. 
The company plans to become the world’s largest producer of APET sheet packaging 
and the Middle East’s largest producer of PET resins. It will be exporting 
primarily to the US, Europe and other markets, including the Middle East, India, 
China and the Far East. It already has 40 customers mostly in the US, UK and 
Western Europe.</font></p>

<b>Advantages of Oman<br>
</b>Why was Oman chosen as the location? Barakat, who is also the Managing 
Director of Octal Holding, responded, “We reviewed lot of other markets but 
selected Oman for its excellent logistics and stable environment. Salalah, in 
particular, has an excellent infrastructure. It enables us to bring in raw 
material from the other parts of Middle East, convert them and export them. 
Within two weeks, our products can reach anywhere in the world. Another 
important factor for choosing Oman was its FTA with the US and the present 
negotiations with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to remove import duties 
on exports from Oman to EU.” <br>
<br>
The move to develop one of the world’s fastest growing packaging companies in 
the Sultanate responds to the global trend for convenience food packaging and 
the increasing use of clear rigid plastic for consumer products and 
merchandising. APET’s clarity, gloss and toughness make it ideal for goods that 
require both protection and shelf life, and the product is completely 
recyclable.<br>
<br>
Octal entered the market in December 2006 with 20,000 tonnes per year production 
capacity, which in September was augmented by an additional 10,000 tonnes per 
year. A new twin PET resin and APET sheet complex will provide a further 300,000 
tonnes of APET sheet-making capacity from April 2008. The company will be 
looking at establishing upstream and downstream activities in Oman, beyond its 
current scope of activity, with the active participation of Omani companies.<br>
<br>
Talking about competition in the global market, Barakat said, “On the PET resin 
side, there are many producers. The global capacity is 14 million tonnes. We 
will be making only 300,000 tonnes. But in terms of APET sheet, a packaging 
material for food and consumer products, there are not many large competitors. 
It is more of a cottage industry. In Europe, there are three large players. In 
the US, there are two. From next year, we will be five times larger than the 
largest PET producer in the world.”<br>
<br>
<b>Hi-tech product</b><br>
What makes Octal so competitive? Barakat said: “Octal can tailor its product to 
a specific gauge, which saves money for its clients. When the gauge is held to 
less than 1 per cent variation, manufacturers know exactly how much packaging 
will be produced per tonne of APET sheet. There are other benefits, such as 
easier storage and higher shipping volumes. In the end, we just found a way to 
take an existing process and make it better.<br>
<br>
“Our manufacturing complex is designed to address the industry’s cost and 
quality failures that are hampering the growth of APET. Octal is the first 
manufacturer to have fully integrated production from resin to sheet on one 
site, and to develop a base in Oman to compete worldwide.” <br>
<br>
Octal Holding will give a major boost to Oman’s non-oil exports, especially to 
the US. Informs Barakat, “If you look at Central Bank of Oman’s Annual Report 
2006, non-oil exports to the US from Oman in 2006 were US$40 million 
approximately. We will be exporting five times that to the US from next year. 
Overall, we will have sales of US$500 million per annum through 100 per cent 
exports. In addition to generation of thousands of jobs, directly or indirectly, 
the Salalah Port will earn significant fees, not only in terms of shipping but 
in handling also.<br>
<br>
“It positions Oman as the leader in the world in a very important segment that 
is consumer packaging. It is a high technology-led product category. It is not 
easy for others to catch up fast.”<br>
<br>
On the strategy ahead, he said, “We need to develop our infrastructure and 
capacities fast, otherwise we will lose the advantage. The key matrix is volume, 
operating leverage and margin. We need to invest more and more to build enough 
capacity to capture 40 per cent of the market before the competition heats up. 
We have 500,000 sq m. of land in Salalah, a very strong balance sheet and the 
backing of financially strong local and international institutions to finance 
the expansion of our operations. We have got to become more competitive at an 
accelerated pace as demand grows.”<br>
<br>
Mohammed Hassan Al-Theeb, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Salalah Free Zone 
Company, said: “Octal Holding is the first investor to set up a plant in Salalah 
Free Zone, and the company has committed to invest significant capital in its 
production facilities. This will lead to a substantial increase in non-oil 
exports from Oman and a rapid increase in activity at Salalah Port.<br>
<br>
“The project is expected to create substantial direct and indirect employment. 
Many Omani companies will benefit from tender awards and many ancillary upstream 
and downstream businesses will also gain.”<br>
<br>
AbdulRazak Ali Issa, Chief Executive, BankMuscat said: “Octal is the first 
project of this size in the region that is being financed on a limited recourse 
project finance basis.” He added: “Projects in the region tend to be either 
supported by government, the developer or through off-take agreements. Lenders 
are comfortable with the market risk for Octal based on its disciplined 
development approach and its clear market strategy. This should open up the 
financing market for similarly well structured projects.”

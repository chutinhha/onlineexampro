<b>A lacklustre month on the MSM was otherwise livened by some corporate events. 
OER reports<br>
</b><br>
The Muscat Securities Market displayed lacklustre performance during the 
one-month period ended September 15. The benchmark MSM-30 general index, which 
has generated an 18.36 per cent year to date return, fell 1.07 per cent or 71.92 
points during the period. This was primarily due to selling pressure seen in the 
banking counters, which caused the banking index to drop 1.44 per cent. The 
industrial index augmented by 4.17 per cent and emerged as the highest year to 
date gainer surpassing the banking index and generating a return of 27.91 per 
cent. <br>
<br>
In key corporate events, Galfar Engineering and Contracting Company’s IPO 
mobilised RO872.97 million, indicating an oversubscription of 14.5 times. Galfar 
made an all-time record in IPO collection in the Sultanate, even bigger than the 
funds collected by Oman Telecommunications Company, which offered RO288 million 
and could attract RO700 million. The institutional investors, who will get 40 
per cent of the IPO, offered RO790.72 million while individuals put in RO82.25 
million.<br>
<br>
In another important development, Al Jazeera Steel Products Co.’s board resolved 
that the company is entering into a subscription agreement with Global Buyout 
Fund LP and its associates. The subscription agreement sets out that the company 
will increase its issued share capital from RO6,120,000 to RO12,489,796 by 
issuing 63,697,960 shares, each with a par value of RO0.100 per share and at a 
price of 0.325 per share. The new shares will be allotted to Global Buyout Fund 
LP by way of private placement.<br>
<br>
After a long legal battle, the EGM of Dhofar Cattle Feed Co. finally authorised 
the Board of Directors to take necessary action regarding the withdrawal of 
Garziz Farm and Sahnout Farm legal cases subject to the condition that Ministry 
of Agriculture agree and sign a mutual settlement between the Government and the 
Company.<br>
<br>
Also, Majan Glass Co. has announced the successful commissioning of its fourth 
production line on August 25.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>GCC Market<br>
</b>The markets ended mixed for the one-month period ended September 15. The 
Doha bourse was the top gainer and the DSM index increased by 4.32 per cent to 
7716.53 points during the period. All the major indices on the exchange ended on 
a positive note, with the industrial and banking indices rising by 5.75 per cent 
and 4.42 per cent, respectively. The Kuwaiti index, which has the highest year 
to date return of 27.87 per cent, was the second largest gainer, increasing by 
2.17 per cent. All the major indices ended in the green, with the investment 
index moving up by 2.72 per cent. The Bahraini bourse ended almost flat gaining 
0.41 per cent. However, the insurance and the banking counters gained 7.53 per 
cent and 2.67 per cent, respectively. <br>
<br>
After the heavy buying witness on the Saudi exchange in recent months, the 
general index corrected by 1.21 per cent during the one-month period ended 
September 15. Lacklustre performance was seen in the insurance counters and the 
insurance index dwindled by 10.06 per cent. However, this was partially offset 
by the buying witnessed in the banking counters, which caused the Saudi banking 
index to rise by 1.55 per cent. The Abu Dhabi and Dubai bourses shed 0.67 per 
cent and 0.15 per cent, respectively, during the period. While the industrial 
index lost 3.32 per cent on the Abu Dhabi exchange, banking counters were the 
top losers on the DFM, shedding 1.01 per cent. The much-awaited Deyaar 
Development Company got listed on the DFM bourse on September 5 and generated 
huge volumes in the additional trading sessions.<br>

<b>Research Highlights<br>
Raysut Cement Co. SAOG Research Abstract</b><br>
For the first half of 2007, Raysut Cement Co. (RCC) reported an increase of 14.5 
per cent in revenues y-o-y and 4.4 per cent quarter on quarter. While cement 
dispatches reduced during the second quarter, the company was able to maintain a 
positive trend in turnover and profitability due to higher realisations from its 
overseas markets. RCC has been taking advantage of the upward cement cycle by 
adding capacities at the right time. From less than 1 million TPA 2 years ago, 
the company has expanded to 3 million TPA capacity in a phased manner. With 
better realisations and incremental volumes, there has been a marked hike in 
investment return ratios also, driving the price of its stock to current levels. 
With a positive demand outlook and rising realisations, combined with the 
addition of Kiln 4 easing the supply side, we expect RCC to perform well in 
FY07-08, achieving an EPS of RO0.125 and RO0.157 for FY07 and FY08, 
respectively. Vision assigns a ‘Hold’ rating for the stock.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>Galfar IPO Research Abstract</b><br>
Galfar’s IPO is coming at a time when the company is embracing yet another 
high-growth trajectory, which should move in tandem with overall infrastructure 
development and construction activity in Oman. Given the buoyancy in the economy 
and post-cyclone restoration efforts, it can be believed that the spending on 
infrastructure and new industries by the government and other private players 
will gather momentum in the days to come. As per 2007 budget, RO500 million 
worth of infrastructure development projects (non-oil) is envisaged, and an 
additional RO135 million is earmarked for the electricity sector. Strong order 
book position of RO600 million and a healthy conversion rate (historically about 
35-40 per cent) makes us believe that the company will be able to achieve its 
projected financials with much ease. <br>
<br>
Though the tenders are yet to be awarded, the company expects that it is the 
lowest bidder in contracts worth over RO150 million. The financial projections 
for 2007 for Galfar indicate 46 per cent growth on top line (40 per cent of 
projected revenues achieved up to May 2007) and 30 per cent growth in bottom 
line (39 per cent of projected profits achieved up to May 2007). As new orders 
get added to the book, we expect the projections for 2008 and 2009 to be 
upgraded. At an EBITDA multiple of 4 times and PE multiple of 7 times on its 
2007 estimates, we believe the Galfar offering is priced attractively for 
investors.<br>

<b>Renaissance Services SAOG Research Abstract </b><br>
Renaissance Services (RNS) registered a y-o-y growth of over 35 per cent in its 
top line. On a q-o-q basis, the growth has been over 24 per cent mainly driven 
by the marine services group, which contributes roughly 32 per cent of the 
company’s total revenues. The Contract Services Group too witnessed good 
additions to top line through Norsk Offshore Catering, which RNS acquired during 
Q3 FY06. Operating margins declined due to the lower impact of ‘contract 
services’ business; in Q207, though, there was some improvement. The company’s 
business model has turned better with increased visibility in earnings from a 
sustainable stream of revenues. Prominent in the new business model, the Marine 
Services segment is expected to ease out the volatility in earnings arising from 
the unsustainable Contract Services business, which used to be the key profit 
driver for the company even up to the first half of FY05.<br>
<br>
Current capex layout of roughly US$500 million (RO192 million) should push RNS 
into a bigger league in the marine and oil and gas services business. The 
company has also been able to successfully diversify its core profit-stream from 
the high-risk contracts business to more sustainable and stable businesses like 
marine services. Management’s strategy to have a blend of asset-based and 
service-based businesses within the same fold has been working well for RNS 
during this period of metamorphosis. Assuming significant growth in marine 
services group and following current capex plans, our model works out an EPS of 
RO0.068 for FY07 and RO0.077 for FY08. Current valuations discount these 
estimates by 10.5 and 9.3 times. Given the positive business outlook and low 
valuations with respect to growth, Vision maintains a ‘buy’ rating on the stock.

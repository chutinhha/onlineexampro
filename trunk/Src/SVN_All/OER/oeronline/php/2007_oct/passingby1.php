<b>Wayne Scherger</b>, Vice President (Divisional Services), MAF Shopping 
Malls, was in Muscat in September for the opening of the RO22.5 million 
expansion of Muscat City Centre, owned by MAF Shopping Malls. He talked at 
length with Akshay Bhatnagar and Susmita De about the changing dynamics of the 
Omani retail sector and the growth strategy of MAF Shopping Malls, part of Majid 
Al Futtaim Group.<br>
<b>
<br>
How do you look at Oman’s retail market? <br>
</b>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">I think it has changed quite a lot in 
the last several years and it is continuing to change. When Muscat City Centre (MCC) 
entered this market in October 2001, it was relatively an unknown entity. When 
we first opened, we really had to do a lot of convincing to get some of the 
international brands to come.<br>
<br>
When we first opened, it took about a year-and-a-half and then it really gained 
a solid footing. To make our presence known, we researched very well about the 
local market. The brands and the retail groups initially came because we saw 
their potential in Oman. We saw that a growing segment of the market is 
absolutely young.<br>
<br>
<b>What is your strategy for expansion in Oman? <br>
</b>We have another project, Qurm City Centre (QCC), that will again be anchored 
by Carrefour. It will be smaller than the Muscat City Centre. In all the markets 
we are in or we want to be in, to see what the actual potential is we are 
actively doing our analysis based on the success of Muscat City Centre, the 
economic indicators, population growth and the retail span. We feel that Oman is 
the market we want to continue to invest in.<b><br>
<br>
Can you tell us more about QCC?<br>
</b>The foundation work is happening now. We are going to make a formal 
announcement on QCC soon.<b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="passingby1.jpg" width="350" height="231" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Will it not impact your business in Muscat City Centre? <br>
</b>Any new retail in the market is going to have some impact on other 
retailers. We feel that Oman, specifically the Muscat market, is growing at a 
fascinating rate and going to absorb more retail. For example, in North America, 
the average retail space per capita in the market is almost 20 sq ft.<br>
<br>
<b>In Dubai, the average is about 5 to 5.4 sq ft. Compared to Oman, Dubai is a 
different market as there is a larger floating population due to influx of 
tourists…</b><br>
<br>
But in Oman the average retail space per capita is 1.3 sq ft. Oman is 
under-serviced as far as retail is concerned. There is a potential for other 
shops as well. In Qurm, although QCC will change the market to a degree and 
change the shopping pattern too, we don’t feel it is going to have major impact 
on the viability of Muscat City Centre. I think it will be complementary; it 
will solidify our position in the market.<b><br>
<br>
Are you not considering other locations also, like Salalah, Sohar and other 
places? <br>
</b>We are analysing the potential in every segment of the Omani market. We have 
no definite plan now but there is an opportunity and we are going to make future 
investments in Oman. At this point, nothing else can be announced.<br>
<b><br>
Do you have any plans for The Wave, Muscat project in which your parent group 
has substantial stake?<br>
</b>That is definitely something that seeks our attention.<br>
<b><br>
Back to MCC, what is stopping you from increasing the leisure and entertainment 
element? <br>
</b>At this point, the MCC has a restriction. We don’t have the space for it. In 
our Dubai-based site, leisure and entertainment are an integral part of the 
shopping centre experience.<b><br>
<br>
What kind of footfall growth are you expecting now from MCC?<br>
</b>We see a very strong growth rate in footfalls. During expansion, our 
footfalls had softened but the sales had increased. So we not only expect our 
footfalls to increase but the average spending of customer is also going to 
increase.<b><br>

      <img border="0" src="passingby2.jpg" width="250" height="112" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"></b>Muscat City Centre opened its new facilities built at a cost of RO22.5 
million after a 16-month construction process. With 42 new brands, dedicated 
flyover and more spacious multi-level parking lot, Muscat City Centre has become 
bigger and better than ever before. The original 33,036 sq. m. of gross lease 
area of MCC has now been expanded to a total of 60,484 sq. m., nearly doubling 
the size of the mall and bringing in a total of 63 new stores (overall 144 
stores) since the beginning of 2007. The iconic fashion brands, such as Zara, 
Gap, Banana Republic, Forever 21, Fat Face, Aldo, Stradavarius along with Tommy 
Hilfiger, Hugo Boss and Lacoste, are expected to attract larger number of 
shoppers to the centre. Of the new stores that have been added to the mall, 95 
per cent of the brands are making an entry into the Oman retail market for the 
first time. The mega expansion has added 300 new job opportunities for Omanis, 
increasing total localisation of the entire mall to over 600 jobs. </font></td>

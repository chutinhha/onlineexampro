<img border="0" src="pdo1.jpg" width="250" height="258" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">In recent years, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) has embarked on a major drive 
to sustain oil production. As primary and secondary recovery techniques come to 
the end of their natural life, PDO is increasingly turning to Enhanced Oil 
Recovery (EOR) methods to extend Oman’s production plateau into the coming 
decades. In 2006, the company spent more than US$2 billion in oilfield 
development projects and is likely to continue to see continued high capital 
expenditure in the coming years. Oman Economic Review spoke to PDO’s deputy 
managing director <b>Dr. Abdulla al-Lamki</b> about the company’s plans.<br>
<br>
<b>What triggered PDO’s move to EOR on such a large scale?</b><br>
The main change of our strategy towards EOR is due to the maturity of our 
producing oilfields. All fields in the world have limited recovery from primary 
mechanisms and Oman is no exception. We operate a portfolio of over 120 fields 
and in many of them we have already followed up with secondary methods, 
primarily waterfloods or gas injection. We have now reached a point when we need 
to embark on tertiary mechanisms and those are EOR. However, in Oman there is an 
additional factor, namely the existence of multiple fields with very heavy, 
viscous oil which require thermal methods to heat the oil and improve recovery.<br>
<br>
<b>To what extent will EOR improve your final recovery factors?<br>
</b>The average recovery factor of our portfolio is around 21 per cent from 
primary and secondary methods and we can add another 6 per cent by the 
application of further secondary and EOR methods.<br>
<br>
However, matching the right EOR technology to individual fields is a complex 
task. The available processes are not universally applicable as each field has 
its own unique characteristics. Indeed, for some fields, an appropriate EOR 
method might not exist at this moment in time. And, more importantly, EOR 
technology is costly requiring the careful appraisal of each project to ensure 
that it is economically viable. Unless oil prices are very high, many EOR 
technologies such as the use of chemical surfactants or direct heat injection 
are not economically viable even though they might be technologically 
appropriate.<br>
<br>
<b>As one of the first companies applying EOR techniques in multiple projects, 
how has PDO managed to find the necessary expertise?</b><br>
I recall that there was an excellent global pool of EOR experts in the 1960s and 
70s in areas such as in-situ combustion and steam-driven production. However, 
low oil prices in the ‘80s and ‘90s meant that the oil industry as a whole moved 
away from EOR processes and, unfortunately, we lost 20 years of expertise.<br>
<br>
What PDO has done with the help of our private shareholders is to draw on the 
remaining expertise around the world. We visited companies which had already 
embarked on tertiary recovery such as the Californian oil producer Aera Energy 
which is jointly owned by Shell and ExxonMobil. We drew on some of the available 
Shell know-how in the US and Canada but fundamentally we have been forced to 
develop our own in-house expertise. I am glad to say that, today, we are a 
global leader in EOR technology. We are the only Shell joint venture company in 
the process of developing projects using the three main available EOR 
technologies; miscible gas injection at the Harweel field, steam injection at 
the Qarn Alam and Amal fields and polymer injection at Marmul. These projects 
will help us to continue growing our in-house expertise for the next phase in 
which we have a string of EOR projects in Southern Oman.<br>
<br>
<b>How is PDO managing to cope with surging engineering, procurement and 
construction (EPC) costs that are affecting companies throughout the GCC region?
</b><br>
Our projects are, indeed, a lot more expensive than they were three or four 
years ago. For example, the initial bid for the Qarn Alam project was horrendous 
at US$1.6 billion. We managed to reduce this considerably by splitting the 
contract into on-plot and off-plot elements. This allowed us to capitalise on 
the expertise of local Omani contractors for the off-plot work while limited the 
need for international contractors to the on-plot component. This is the 
direction we will be forced to take over the next few years. As you point out, 
the GCC market for turnkey EPC contracts is overheated and, unfortunately for 
PDO, our projects are relatively small compared to the likes of Saudi Arabia and 
Qatar which puts us in a weaker competitive position.<br>
<br>
<b>Has there been a trade-off between reducing costs and ensuring timely project 
delivery?</b><br>
We may have to accept such a trade-off. In recent months, we have had to accept 
our contractors’ time constraints given that many of them are suffering from 
delays by their own suppliers in the delivery of materials. But, furthermore, we 
may well have to accept that we may save some costs by delaying the project 
slightly. However, such delays might also lead to a better project by giving us 
extra time to improve detailed design work and by allowing the contractor more 
time to deliver the project.<br>
<br>
<b>How well is the Harweel field miscible gas injection project progressing?<br>
</b>Harwell is going well. We had some initial issues following the introduction 
of new industry standards to manage the risks of working in a high-pressure, 
sour gas environment and we had to adapt our engineering designs accordingly.<br>
<br>
<b>In the short to medium term how do you see PDO’s oil production evolving?</b><br>
In the short to medium term, I expect oil production to be within the current 
target range with the commissioning of EOR projects. So, for the next 8 to 10 
years we will be able to maintain our production levels and we are working to 
find new ways in the next few years to maintain our plateau for longer. Indeed, 
I am confident that we can. We continue to invest heavily in new exploration in 
our concession area and we have had some important successes, most notably the 
Budour Northeast field in Southern Oman. <br>
<br>
<b>Do you see PDO’s move into EOR as the beginning of a regional trend?<br>
</b>Yes, in many ways PDO is ahead of the region and I expect a lot of countries 
going down the EOR route in the future. Eventually, any mature oil company will 
get to the phase when tertiary recovery is required.

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>EOR is done through injections of materials not normally present in the 
reservoir. It changes reservoir or fluid properties to achieve recovery higher 
than otherwise possible. This improved extraction is achieved by either gas 
injection, thermal recovery, or chemical injection</b><br>
<br>
Gas injection is the most commonly used EOR technique. Here, gas such as carbon 
dioxide (CO2), natural gas, or nitrogen is injected into the reservoir whereupon 
it expands and thereby pushes additional oil to a production wellbore, and 
moreover dissolves in the oil to lower its viscosity and improves the flow rate 
of the oil. The prospects of using CO2 has gathered much interest, as this would 
allow storing it away from the atmosphere and hence a tool to combat global 
warming. Oil displacement by CO2 injection relies on the phase behaviour of CO2 
and crude oil mixtures that are strongly dependent on reservoir temperature, 
pressure and crude oil composition. These mechanisms range from oil swelling and 
viscosity reduction for injection of immiscible fluids (at low pressures) to 
completely miscible displacement in high-pressure applications. In these 
applications, more than half and up to two-thirds of the injected CO2 returns 
with the produced oil and is usually re-injected into the reservoir to minimize 
operating costs. The remainder is trapped in the oil reservoir by various means.<br>
<br>
Other techniques include thermal recovery (which uses heat to improve flow 
rates), and, more rarely, chemical injection, where polymers are injected to 
increase the effectiveness of waterfloods, or the use of detergent-like 
surfactants to help lower the surface tension that often prevents oil droplets 
from moving through a reservoir.</font></td>

<b>With new agencies coming up, international and regional powerhouses taking 
more interest in Oman and brand marketers giving more weight to PR in their 
marketing mix, the public relations industry in Oman is on the verge of an 
exciting phase. Akshay Bhatnagar looks at the PR environment in the Sultanate</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">The last year has been the most significant period in the short history of the 
public relations industry in Oman. Cyclone Gonu created havoc and institutions, 
both for profit and non-profit, realised the need for favourable public 
relations to present the true picture or to hide any ugly scars and show a brave 
face. No amount of advertising or any other communication discipline could have 
done what public relations did to maintain, in fact to reassert, the trust among 
external and internal communities for the institution and the country at large.<br>
<br>
A closer look at the developments in the communications’ industry in the last 
year indicate that public relations has definitely emerged as a stand-alone 
discipline, with the entry of new, local and international specialist players. 
Thus, ASDA’A, the Middle East’s public relations’ consultancy powerhouse, has 
opened an office in Muscat; as did Action Global Communications, the independent 
PR network heavyweight present in Central, East and South East Europe, North 
Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia; and so did BPG, earlier known as Bates 
PanGulf.<br>
<br>
Thus, Action Global runs a joint venture outfit Buzzword/Action, which 
represents MCS/Action in Oman and is an integral part of Action’s global 
network. And BPG has set up shop in the form of BPG Adinc. BPG is part of the 
WPP Group, one of the largest communication services groups in the world.<br>
<br>
Earlier, with the exception of MomentumPR, most of the so-called PR agencies 
were in practice an extension of ad agencies. Many such entities still exist. 
Many of them have international affiliations but an equity ownership, partly or 
fully, can definitely improve the image of their PR interests in Oman.<br>
<br>
The new heavyweights may not have the luxury of large set-ups seen in markets 
such as Dubai but they promise to bring a qualitative difference to the Omani 
market with best industry practices and a rich international experience.<br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="cover4.jpg" width="173" height="268" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Shortcomings of PR in Oman</b><br>
One of the most ardent believers in the powers of PR is Amer Mustafa Al Fadhil, 
Vice President – External Affairs, The Wave, Muscat. According to him, “The PR 
scene in Oman is under-served and under-valued. It is fairly premature. Public 
relations discipline is often misconstrued to the function of PROs – dealing 
with the ministries for liaison work.”<br>
<br>
Supporting him, Lutz Meyer, MCS/Action's CEO for the GCC, says, “There is lack 
of knowledge about what PR really is and what PR can do. There is also lack of 
competence in integrating corporate messages into all written and verbal 
communications. We need to explain to our customers that public relations is a 
matter which involves the management and needs its input and its engagement.”<br>
<br>
In Oman, a significant percentage of the companies, specially, those with little 
or no involvement with multinational partners, generally take it for granted 
that ad agencies will offer PR services either free or for a nominal fee as a 
value add when signing up the ad account. Says Sarah Livingston, Managing 
Director of Momentum Public Relations and one of the early movers in the PR 
business in Oman, “This happens many times as clients like to have one point of 
contact for ease of business.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover3.jpg" width="175" height="268" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">This also happens due to the fact that many companies don’t recognise public 
relations as a separate discipline and refuses to de-link it from advertising 
services. For a majority of such companies, PR means two things – arranging 
press conferences and ensuring placement of press releases in various 
publications. They also believe that there is a co-relation between their media 
investment via ad releases and editorial coverage in a publication. <br>
<br>
“Though this is definitely not the ideal way to manage communications to achieve 
strategic brand objectives, many companies in Dubai and the region, believe in 
such practices. Fortunately, the scenario is changing,” says Nitin Puri, the CEO 
of BPG Adinc.<br>
<br>
But how will this co-relation equation change? And who can engineer this change? 
Al Fadhil suggests, “The readers of the publications are going to play a major 
role in this change. They should be more demanding and ask for more credible 
news. They should voice their opinion. Unfortunately, this is not happening. 
Otherwise, the co-relation would have been lower than what it is now. At the 
same time, there are publications that demand ad support from companies in 
return for editorial coverage. Such publications are not doing justice to their 
readers.” If the media is compromised in terms of its trustworthiness, then the 
Ries and Ries’ argument falls apart: no credibility = no brand. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="cover2.jpg" width="175" height="268" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Taking the debate in a different direction, Nitin Puri says, “Generally, PR in 
Oman is evaluated on the basis of editorial space. It can’t be and should not be 
the primary way of evaluating PR. It should be about the effectiveness of the 
message rather than the space. When space alone becomes the criteria, the 
important elements of the PR exercise get missed.” Crisis management is another 
area where companies need to share more information with their PR agencies. Many 
companies tend to manage such issues on their own which is not the right 
approach and doesn’t inspire confidence in the PR agency. They have to believe 
that their PR agencies will maintain confidentiality even as they help achieve 
specific PR objectives.<br>
<br>
<b>The brighter side of the picture<br>
</b>Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Definitely. It is good to know 
that there is a committed lot of PR professionals and organisations that believe 
in the power of public relations and they are taking active steps to make it 
more credible and trustworthy. Al Fadhil says, “Advertising is incredible, but 
PR is credible. PR has a lot of potential but it requires a few champions to 
take it forward. Recently, a group of PR professionals in Oman came together to 
create a Society of PR Professionals. It will work towards increasing the level 
of awareness about PR and infuse more professionalism into the industry. It can 
be more productive if agencies, marketers and professionals can work together.”<br>
<br>
He adds, “The leaderships in relatively new companies are very well educated and 
exposed to best international business practices. They understand the need and 
importance of PR professionals, especially Omanis within the team. They are 
driving the PR industry and bringing a much required change in the mindset.” 
Says Livingston, “The PR industry is changing as new publications are entering 
more frequently than ever before. The companies are finding it difficult as they 
really don’t have enough knowledge about the new entrants and don’t trust their 
readership quality and figures. They place information in bits and pieces 
everywhere to either keep certain people happy or hope to reach out to their 
desired target group. Many of them don’t know whether what they are doing is 
right or wrong. It is a very interesting scenario from the PR agencies’ 
perspective, as there is an increased and genuine need of professional PR 
consultants to help companies in managing their public relations with the 
proliferation of media.”<br>
<br>
In fact, it is the MNC companies that are making a major difference in the way 
PR is perceived in Oman. Take, for example, when Shangri La Barr Al Jissah 
Resort &amp; Spa was about to open towards 2005-end, it hired a Hong Kong-based 
communications agency to train key managers of the property in handling public 
relations in different scenarios, with the help of leading international and 
Muscat-based journalists. Reveals Desmond Hatton, General Manager, Shangri La 
Barr Al Jissah, “We hosted 5,000 room nights in 2006 for fam groups (travel 
agents etc.), so that they could see the destination and experience its 
uniqueness. Hundreds of journalists have been flown in by us in the last two 
years to promote the destination and property. We are again going to bring in a 
group of international journalists so that they can witness that Oman is back to 
normal after Cyclone Gonu and it will help to boost room occupancy that has come 
down post-Gonu on the whole for the hospitality industry.”<br>
<br>
Many Omani companies are also placing great emphasis on public relations. 
BankMuscat is a prime example. The bank has one of the most professional, if not 
the most professional, public relations team in Oman that has contributed 
immensely in developing and maintaining the bank’s strong brand equity. The 
entry of MNC PR agencies is also expected to bring a major change in the market. 
Says Puri, <br>
<br>
“We must create PR initiatives that needs to be strategically relevant to what 
the brand is trying to achieve. For example, BPG managed the PR of Coca Cola’s 
sponsorship of Dubai Summer Surprises. Our task was to leverage sponsorship and 
generate salience and a surprise factor around the brand. To achieve our goal, 
we created many events. For example, we brought Coke memorabilia from all over 
the world and held an exhibition in Dubai. On the weekends we also arranged for 
celebrity chefs to prepare special dishes with Coke as the main ingredient. 
These events were written about, as they were interesting and unexpected.”<br>
<br>
Summarises Sunil John, Partner &amp; Managing Director – Middle East, ASDA’A Public 
Relations, “The challenge of the modern world is that we are time poor but 
resource rich. We lead incredibly busy lives, inundated with meetings, memos, 
phone calls, e-mails, television, newspapers, the internet – and that’s not 
counting the demands on our personal time. For a company to get its message 
across clearly and effectively in the middle of this clutter, it has to not only 
be seen and heard but believed, and only public relations can achieve that.<br>
<br>
“At its heart, PR is about trust: about building a relationship between 
consumers and companies at every step of the way. PR breaks through the clutter 
because it can personalise a message in ways advertising and other forms of 
marketing cannot, no matter how creative they are. PR is also much more 
versatile: it can respond in different ways to specific needs, can reach 
specific audiences and has effectively no limits on its channels of delivery. 
This is why, worldwide, advertising is continually losing its market share to 
PR, and we are confident this will gradually be true of the MENA region 
(including Oman) as well,” John concludes.

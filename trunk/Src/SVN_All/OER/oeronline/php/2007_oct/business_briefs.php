selling in November</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="business1.jpg" width="250" height="192" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Al Sawadi Investment and Tourism (ASIT) has made public the timetable for the 
launch of its Blue City project and sales of freehold property in the first 
phase. “The master plan and initial artists’ impressions of the first phase will 
be revealed in October. The first retail sales will commence in November. 
Construction at the site has already begun and vertical construction is 
scheduled to start from December,” informed Anees Issa Al Zadjali, Chairman of 
ASIT. The Blue City is a unique 32 sq km project, expected to create an entirely 
new city of more than 250,000 people, with an estimated US$15-20 billion of 
investment.<br>
<br>
“The dynamics of the Blue City project and its importance to Oman cannot be 
underestimated,” said Al Zadjali. “The success of the first phase of this 
project is crucial to succeeding phases, so it is imperative to ensure our plans 
are in line with projected market trends and forces”. Chris Steel of Hamptons 
remarked: “We are expecting tremendous demand for the Blue City residential 
properties, from within the region and further afield, particularly the UK where 
interest levels are extremely strong”. AECO, a partnership between Elliniki 
Technodomiki TEB of Greece and Enka of Turkey, has been appointed as contractor 
for the first phase, which will see an initial area totalling 5.5 sq km or 17.2 
per cent of the projected final site land of 32 sq km being developed. Al 
Zadjali said announcements on third-party contracts and partners will also be 
made shortly.<br>

<font color="#CC3300" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>TKM – Ernst &amp; Young Big 
Business Idea Gala<br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Muscat – Entries to the TKM–Ernst &amp; 
Young Big Business Idea Competition, the largest technology-focused business 
plan competition in the Gulf region, closed late last week. Backed by Ericsson, 
Nawras, NCR, GroFin, Infocomm and OER, this year’s competition final and Gala 
Dinner will take place 28 October at the Crowne Plaza Hotel under the patronage 
of HE Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, Minister of Commerce &amp; industry. <br>
<br>
“The four finalists will present power pitches to the judging panel at the Gala 
Dinner. The panel of judges will then make their final deliberations and 
announce the 2007 winner,” said Mohammed Al Maskari, Director General, Knowledge 
Oasis Muscat (KOM). <br>
<br>
This year the competition has a top prize of RO6,000 awarded to the winning 
business plan. The winner is also granted 12 months rent free office 
accommodation in the TKM incubator program based at KOM.<br>
<br>
”We welcome entries from anyone - individuals, teams, new companies, colleges 
creating spin-offs, scientists, students and entrepreneurs - with a good, 
innovative idea for a science, technology, medical or design-based business,” 
commented the KOM Director General.<br>
<br>
The TKM–Ernst &amp; Young Big Business Idea Competition is not just about the 
competition itself. Former entrants have used the event as a launch pad to raise 
investment for their ventures, and the competition’s finalists, particularly, 
benefit from the additional exposure they receive at the annual Gala Dinner, 
which provides them with instant access to an audience of influential business 
angels and venture capitalists seeking new investment opportunities.<br>
<br>
One company that has benefited in this way is Qumreiyat who is developing a 
dynamic tourism portal. Qumreyat’s Zawan Al Sabti was one of three responsible 
for presenting the prize-winning pitch at last year’s final, she commented: “The 
TKM–Ernst &amp; Young Big Business Idea Competition provided our start-up with a 
great opportunity. We were able to present our initial ideas on business 
strategy and receive valuable feedback from experienced professionals on how 
best to take the company forward. Since presenting at the final in 2006 the team 
have followed up on interest expressed by several organizations who attended the 
event.”<br>
<br>
Al Sabti’s colleague, Majda Al Hinai, agrees that the competition provides an 
invaluable opportunity for young Omani entrepreneurs. “Qumreiyat has attracted a 
significant amount of interest since its launch and taking up residency in the 
TKM incubator program at KOM. The competition provided the focus the team needed 
to define its business strategy. The document we had to produce was a valuable 
starting point on which to build the broader plan for the launch. Our appearance 
at last year’s final clearly raised the company’s profile to a national level, 
something we could not have achieved so quickly on our own.” <br>
<br>
Al Maskari, organiser of the TKM–Ernst &amp; Young Big Business Idea Competition 
added: “The quality of entries is very high and our experienced judges are not 
easily impressed, so getting to the final is a significant achievement, and one 
which is recognised by potential domestic and regional investors.”<br>
<br>
The TKM–Ernst &amp; Young Big Business Idea Competition has been helping to raise 
the profile of start-up and spinout organisations since its inception in 2006 by 
providing valuable exposure for growing businesses and access to a wide range of 
resources, advice and guidance through its seminar programme and networking 
activities. The competition is free of charge and open to all Omani nationals.

<img border="0" src="business3.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Galfar Engineering and Contracting SAOG (under transformation) raised RO873 
million through its IPO as against the actual issue size of RO60 million. This 
was the biggest-ever sale that an IPO has recorded in Oman. The issue was 
oversubscribed 14.5 times. The IPO comprised 100 million ordinary shares at a 
price of RO0.602 per share – nominal value of RO0.100, premium of RO0.500 and 
issue expenses of RO0.002 per share.<br>
<br>
Investors and analysts forecast a strong secondary market for Galfar shares as 
institutions were unable to get all the shares they wanted. High net-worth 
individual investors are already showing strong interest, as they paid just 
RO0.602 for a share in an over 14.5 times oversubscribed IPO,” analysts opined. 
In 29,898 applications (28,127 individuals – category I and 771 individuals and 
institutions – category II) investors applied for more than 1.45 billion shares 
making a total of over RO872.969 million (RO82.248 million – category I and 
RO790.720 million – category II). Investors are bullish on listing as they 
expect handsome gains on the day of listing, and in future.</font></p>

assist Omani fisheries</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
The Oman Government has awarded a major US$ 7 million contract to assess the 
country’s fish stocks to a New Zealand consortium spearheaded by fisheries 
management consultant, Bruce Shallard and Associates, according to a press 
statement issued by Bruce Shallard and Associates. It will be the first fish 
stock survey undertaken in Oman since the 1980s. Shallard and his New Zealand 
consortium partners NIWA (National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research), 
Independent Fisheries and Deloitte will spend two years surveying and analysing 
Oman’s fish stocks to help the government make strategic decisions based on 
sound scientific information about the future development of Oman’s fishing 
industry. The New Zealand scientists will be conducting surveys using 
sophisticated technology and a large New Zealand trawler, renamed “Al Mustaqilla” 
(Arabic for independent).<br>
<br>
With the assistance of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE), the country’s 
economic development agency, Shallard has spent many years developing 
relationships in the Middle East including completing contracts in Iran and the 
United Arab Emirates. New Zealand’s reputation for world leading fisheries 
management is seen as a huge asset to looking at the ongoing management of Omani 
fish stocks.<br>

Port and Dry Dock</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<img border="0" src="business6.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The Japan Bank for International Cooperation will give a loan of US$660 million 
(about RO254 million) towards financing the Al-Duqm Port and Dry Dock project 
whose total investment cost is about US$1,096 million (about RO421 million). The 
period of the loan extends to 14 years. The project aims at constructing a port 
and a dry dock in the wilayat of Al-Duqm in the Al-Wusta region to meet the 
requirements of the international market to use the quay facilities to satisfy 
projected industry needs coming up as part of the comprehensive plan to develop 
the wilayat of Al-Duqm.<br>
<br>
A comprehensive master plan has been prepared for Duqm by the Supreme Committee 
for Town Planning, Sultanate of Oman. The area will have a major dry dock, 
commercial port and a shipbuilding yard in future. The master plan has 
designated areas for airport, petroleum refinery and oil storage facilities 
along with downstream industries, a fishing harbour with fishery related 
industries, free trade zones, general industries and tourism projects. It has 
planned a complete residential town with a Town Centre and all modern amenities. 
A tentative allocation of 1,026 hectares has been made and designated as the 
Free Trade Zone. However, the total area in five different locations within the 
Duqm development area available both for FTZ and general industries is about 
21,000 hectares. Out of this, about 3,300 hectares has been designated for the 
study of setting Duqm refinery and petrochemical complex, and about 1,300 
hectares for fishery related industries. The commercial and dry dock facility 
would come up on 237 hectares. While the main port area would come up on a site 
of 115.6 hectares, ship repair facility would have 102-hectare area. It also 
will have about 13.4 hectares for workers and shipping clients to stay and rest. 
Exploring opportunities in tourism is one of the main components in the master 
plan, which includes hotels, resorts and a public beach.<br>

moving from 24 last year to 18th spot this year, according to the ‘Economic 
Freedom of the World: 2007 Annual Report’ released recently by the International 
Research Foundation (IRF). The Sultanate has scored in key components of 
economic freedom measurements on a scale of 1-to-10 where a higher value 
indicates a higher level of freedom. The score for size of government changed 
from 5.9 in last year’s report to 5.7; legal structures and security of property 
rights changed from 7.5 to 7.7; access to sound money changed from 8.6 to 9.4; 
freedom to trade internationally changed from 7.8 to 7.3; while regulation of 
credit, labour and business went up from 6.6 to 8. The Sultanate is essentially 
tied with the UAE for the regional lead but is well above the global average on 
all counts, disclosed Fred McMahon, director of Centre for Globalisation Studies 
of the Fraser Institute. The Canada-based Fraser Institute prepared the report 
in cooperation with independent research organisations in 71 countries, 
including the IRF in Oman. Hong Kong once again tops the international rankings 
for economic freedom, with Singapore a close second and New Zealand third. 
Zimbabwe and Myanmar had the lowest economic freedom ratings of the 141 
countries measured.<br>

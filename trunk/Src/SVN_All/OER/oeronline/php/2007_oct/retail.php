<b>In OER’s last issue, the cover story on retail industry showcased the 
challenges faced by the retailers and consumers. The Minister of Commerce and 
Industry, HE Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, addresses those issues in an exclusive 
interview with Sunil Singh</b><br>

<img border="0" src="retail1.jpg" width="175" height="223" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">What is driving the retail sector boom in Oman?</b><br>
The wholesale and retail trade in Oman grew very strongly by 19.2 per cent in 
2006, the highest-ever recorded growth. The reason behind this was the strong 
growth in all sectors of the economy, higher per capita income, increased salary 
levels of both private and public sector employees, among others, which 
increased the purchasing power of the people.<br>
<br>
<b>How much foreign direct investment (FDI) is allowed in the retail sector in 
Oman?</b><br>
In Oman, 100 per cent FDI is allowed in large hypermarkets on a case-by-case 
basis.<br>
<br>
<b>How is the retail industry contributing to Omanisation?</b><br>
A recent survey of three major hypermarket chains in Oman indicates that the 
total direct employment in these three chains was around 3,300, of which more 
than 50 per cent were Omanis. The Omanisation level will be increased 
progressively. The hypermarkets also generate more indirect employment 
opportunities for nationals in other related supporting services, such as 
transportation, warehousing, packing, etc.<br>
<br>
<b>In what ways will the coming of hypermarkets and malls impact the small 
retailers in Oman?</b><br>
The hypermarkets, which provide centralised shopping facilities for all family 
requirements, have also brought in centralised purchasing, warehousing, 
bulk-breaking and retailing techniques to the country. These concepts were 
non-existent in Oman till a few years back. <br>
Hypermarkets also can offer better quality and variety of products at 
competitive prices to their customers. Small retailers should now take steps to 
improve their quality of services and product range availability to satisfy 
customer needs and also withstand competition.<br>
<br>
<b>Is inflation a drag on the retail boom in Oman?</b><br>
Integration of the Omani economy with the world economy allows faster 
transmission of global inflation through costlier imports. Therefore, Oman alone 
cannot fully contain current moderate inflationary pressures, specially at a 
time when all sectors of the country’s economy are growing. Also, as the dollar 
is depreciating against other regional currencies, imports from Europe, India 
and other Asian countries are becoming expensive. When the economy grows, demand 
and the purchasing power of people also improve accordingly. Therefore, there is 
no reason to believe that the current level of moderate inflation rate 
prevailing in Oman will adversely affect the retail sector growth. <br>
<br>
<b>Is the growth of real estate influencing the retail sector in terms of rents, 
etc?</b><br>
There is no evidence that there is any relation between higher rents and retail 
sector growth. As it has been observed, the year 2006 witnessed an overall 
increase in rents but the year also recorded the highest-ever growth in the 
wholesale and retail sector. Therefore, higher rents have not affected retail 
sector growth.<br>
<br>
<b>The recent fall of Omani rial due to the depreciation of US dollar has 
escalated the cost of imports, which in turn has caused inflationary trends. 
What do you think should be the pricing strategy of hypermarkets to counter the 
inflationary trends?</b><br>
Inflationary pressures are mainly due to the country’s dependence on imports 
from Europe, India, and other Asian countries for essential consumer items. The 
currencies of these countries have become stronger and therefore imports have 
become more expensive. Moreover, the freight cost has also gone up 
internationally due to the escalating fuel prices. However, the government is 
taking every step to ensure that the traders don’t take any undue advantage of 
the situation. The hypermarkets should take prudent measures to cut the cost of 
retailing, wherever possible, and also try to reduce margins to lower the burden 
on their customers. </font></p>

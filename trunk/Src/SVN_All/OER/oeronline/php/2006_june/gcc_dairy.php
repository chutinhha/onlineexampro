<b>International and local pressures are leading to rise in inflation in the GCC<br>
</b><br>
Inflation 
remained at a high all over the world in 2005, particularly in the Middle East. 
Many reasons can be attributed to the soaring inflation in the Gulf region. All 
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are threatened by the strengthening 
of the Euro against the US Dollar. In such a situation, import bill may rise, as 
GCC countries have pegged their currencies to the US Dollar and get most of 
their imports from Europe.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Prices of most of the consumer items are going up making life harder in the Gulf 
region. Across the region, rents have shot through the roof, with the biggest 
jump being witnessed in the UAE and Qatar. Rents shot up by 50 per cent in 
Dubai, the commercial hub of the UAE, during 2005. The housing sector pushed 
inflation up in Qatar as well. According to a report, the housing sector drove 
inflation in the first half of 2005 by 28.45 per cent in Qatar. On the other 
hand, inflation in Oman is easing, for the reason that rents have come down by 
0.3 per cent in January-April 2005 compared to the same period in last year.<br>
<br>
According to official figures, in absolute terms, the highest rate of inflation 
in the Gulf in 2005 was recorded in Qatar, at 7.8 per cent. In the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), consumer prices rose by 6 per cent, Kuwait recorded a modest 3.7 
per cent increase, and Bahrain less than 3 per cent. However, the lower 
inflation rate was recorded in Oman (1.1 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (0.6 per 
cent).<br>
<br>
<b>Fuel Effect</b><br>
Adding to the difficulties is the increasing fuel prices. In September last 
year, the UAE government, in response to the international market rates, 
increased oil prices by 31.5 per cent. Education and health are also proving 
quite an expensive experience for the people. Petrol, gas cylinders, healthcare, 
education, and vegetables, everything has become dearer. However, salary hikes 
are still not matching with the growing expenditures in the region. <br>
<br>
Price rises have become so forceful that the UAE government has increased the 
salaries of their employees by 25 per cent for UAE nationals and 15 per cent for 
expatriates. The Kuwaiti government, which had approved a one-off bonus of 
US$700 for government employees in December 2004, announced an annual pay rise 
of US$2,000. The previous such increase was in 1992. Bahrain’s government also 
proposed a one-off bonus of US$530, plus an annual pay rise of US$4,200 for all 
civil servants. The Saudi government announced a 15 per cent salary increase for 
government employees, marking the Kingdom’s first across-the-board shift in the 
pay scale in more than two decades. The private sector also responded quickly by 
announcing similar pay rises for its employees within days of the government’s 
announcement.<br>
<br>
<b>Low Inflation</b><br>
The pay packet fattens in the UAE, Qatar and to some extent Kuwait, are driven 
largely by inflationary pressures in the economy and increased cost of living. 
The other three <br>
GCC countries — Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman — have had very low inflation 
rates. The pay rises in those markets are driven primarily by increased 
competition for a <br>
limited supply of qualified talent, says the Gulf Talent, <br>
a recruitment portal. <br>

<img border="1" src="gcc_dairy_6_1.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="201">Grand 
Prix is helping transform Bahrain’s economy for the better, with the direct and 
indirect benefits that accrue out of hosting the annual event. The direct 
benefits include expenditures incurred by visitors during Formula One (F-1), 
private investors getting a chance to develop facilities and the public sector 
endeavor in expanding road network. The indirect advantages entail streamlining 
regulations and raising Bahrain’s global profile. <br>
<br>
To be sure, F-1 is a making a fair contribution to Bahrain’s economy. It is 
estimated that activities related to Grand Prix 2006 injected some US$184 
million into Bahrain’s economy. This is a sizeable amount for an economy with a 
GDP of nearly US$10 billion. Spending covers matters such as ticket sales, TV 
coverage, transportation, accommodation, food <br>
and beverage, merchandise and souvenirs, and other leisure activities.<br>
<br>
In retrospect, the government invested some US$150 million on constructing 
Bahrain International Circuit (BIC). Financing of the track was secured as part 
of US$500 million Eurobond issued in 2003, Bahrain’s first international 
financial instrument. The racing track is BIC’s primary facility. <br>
<br>
<b>Tourism</b><br>
Grand Prix has yet added another dimension to Bahrain’s tourism potentials. It 
is partially credited with encouraging developers and entrepreneurs to construct 
new hotels and other types of accommodation facilities in numerous locations 
around Bahrain, and not just Manama, the capital. For instance, a mega project, 
known as Al-Areen Desert Spa and Resort, is being built at the cost of US$750 
million near the site of BIC. The project is a joint venture between Gulf 
Finance House and the government of Bahrain. <br>
<br>
According to Middle East Economic Digest (MEED), two further elements related to 
Al-Areen were uncovered lately. Enshaa Development Real Estate Company decided 
to develop the US$100 million Al-Waha resort. Among others, the project will 
include a luxury hotel and residential, commercial and leisure facilities. Also, 
Kuwait-based Gulf Holding Company disclosed the master plan for the estimated 
US$363 million Al-Areen downtown to be built over an area of 261,000 sq. metres. 
Likewise, the project will include commercial and residential property and 
retail and entertainment facilities. <br>
<br>
Thanks - in part - to Grand Prix, several other leading hotels in the country 
have opted to expand their facilities too, giving a big boost to tourism. This 
is true of the Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Gulf, and Radisson SAS, to name a few 
hotels.<br>
<b><br>
Profile </b><br>
To cap it all, the event helps raising Bahrain’s profile, as the country becomes 
the global focal point of motor sporting for three days. It is estimated that 
some 450 million TV viewers worldwide watched the 2006 Gulf Air Bahrain Grand 
Prix. This extraordinary number is partly credited to an agreement between BIC 
and Al-Jazeera TV of Qatar to broadcast the event on its free-to-air channel. 
Still, Federation International Automobile (FIA) selected Bahrain as season 
opener for the 2006 Formula One World Championship. Traditionally, Australia 
serves as season opener, but not this time, thanks to the Commonwealth Games. </font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right:5px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<b>Streamlining Regulations<br>
</b><br>
<b><img border="1" src="gcc_dairy_5.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="100"></b>Grand 
Prix is also helping streamlining other matters in Bahrain, notably, in doing 
away with the bureaucracy. According to officials of the General Directorate of 
Nationality, Passports and Residence (GDNPR), hundreds of F-1-related visas were 
issued for the three-day event. Visitors are offered a two-week multiple 
re-entry F-1 visas free of charge. Citizens over 30 years of age are extended 
the right of obtaining visa on arrival at the point of entry in Bahrain. <br>
<br>
Besides, hundreds of GCC citizens and qualified residents, who do not require 
visas, entered the country primarily via the King Fahd causeway linking Bahrain 
to Saudi Arabia. Yet, other nationalities need to pre-arrange the process either 
the through a dedicated website or local sponsors. No wonder that some visitors 
stay well beyond the Grand Prix, either for seeking business opportunities or 
for exploring Bahrain’s archeological jewelry. <br>
<br>
All-purpose Facility BIC is a multifaceted facility that includes numerous 
hospitality lounges, in turn used for hosting a wide range of corporate and 
social occasions. The facilities attract corporate incentive programmes, 
including entertainment, exhibitions and seminars. Located in Sakhir areas south 
of Manama, BIC’s added advantage is that of being away from the traffic snarls.<br>
<br>
Finally, two extraordinary developments unfolded in Bahrain in the days leading 
to the big event. For one, RUF of Germany laid the foundation stone for a US$50 
million facility to manufacture special cars for racers and collectors. The RUF 
Bahrain Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly plant will be built within BIC 
complex. For another, Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman highway was inaugurated, thereby 
easing travel between central Manama and Sakhir. Clearly, BIC is helping 
accelerate development throughout the country, and not just Manama, the capital.
<br>
<br>
One thing is for sure. All roads lead to Bahrain when it comes to motor sporting 
in the Middle East. <br>

To encourage investments in the Emirates, the Dubai government has announced the 
creation of the Dubai Corporation for Government Investment under the 
chairmanship of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President and 
Prime Minister of the UAE and the Ruler of Dubai. According to the 19-article 
law, the new body will enjoy financial and administrative independence with full 
legal competence to assume its activities and achieve its objectives. <br>
<br>
The corporation will be responsible for laying down the investment strategy of 
government funds and enhancing the importance of the private sector’s role. It 
will also supervise the government’s financial and industrial investments and 
monitor the activities of all affiliated companies and subsidiaries. <br>
<br>
The board will lay down the general policy and administrative and financial 
regulations, which will be approved by Shaikh Mohammad. It will also issue 
bylaws, rules and decisions to regulate the corporation’s activities and prepare 
the annual budget. <br>
<br>
The Board consists of nine members. Its deputy chairman will be Shaikh Hamdan 
Bin Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Mohammad Bin Rashid

Kuwait plans to privatise non-core oil sector in a phased manner by 2010. “This 
plan aims to allow Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) to focus on exploration 
and production of oil and natural gas,” Energy Minister Sheikh Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah 
said. This so far remains under state control. <br>
<br>
By the end of the current year, KPC plans to sell at least 30 per cent of its 
foreign arm, the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC), and 49 
per cent of Kuwait Drilling Company. Kuwait has already started privatising the 
oil-marketing sector by signing agreements with Al-Oula and Al-Sour companies. 
The minister expressed confidence that private participation in the oil sector 
would allow government to divert its resources in developing other areas of oil 
industry where private participation is not allowed. <br>
<br>
The country is planning to invest over US$20 billion in next five years for the 
development of the oil industry. Kuwait is also planning to privatise two 
petrochemicals projects producing propylene and fertilizers, and KPC subsidiary 
Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC), which currently operates 24 oil tankers for 
crude and petroleum products. This liberalisation strategy will also include the 
granting of licences for up to three new oil tanker companies.<br>
<br>
Kuwait also plans to privatise at least 25 per cent of the planned new 615,000 
barrels per day refinery, which is estimated to cost US$6.3 billion and slated 
to come on line in 2010. The minister said KPC planned to sell its butane gas 
factory, the only one of its kind in Kuwait, and a hospital run by the oil 
sector. Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee unanimously approved a draft 
privatisation law. It is, however, yet to be debated in the National Assembly. 
The bill facilitates the sale of electricity, communications and education 
services but bans the privatisation of oil and gas production. The bill also 
allows the government to retain a golden share of the privatised companies, 
which would give it veto power on any board of directors.</font></p>

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia plans to privatise its stock market and establish 
the Middle East’s largest financial district as a part of economic reforms to 
boost investments. The financial districts that will be constructed over an area 
of 3 million sq. meters are going to house stock exchange as well as banks, 
brokerage services and other financial institutions. This project is expected to 
be completed in three years.<br>
<br>
The move to privatise the bourse will help the stock market operate on more 
professional and transparent bases and introduce new products and services, 
analysts expect. The Saudi stock exchange that operates on an inter-bank basis 
is run by Tadawul, which is managed by the board of the Capital Market Authority 
(CMA), a government organisation. The CMA is looking to launch the Saudi Arabian 
Financial Exchange [SAFX], a private sector corporation. Though the time frame 
is not set for converting the stock exchange as a joint stock company, the 
new-look exchange will introduce new products and services as per the needs of 
the investors.<br>
<br>
The Saudi government may transfer management of the stock exchange to the new 
holding company in next few months, following which the exchange will float 
initial public offering (IPO). The value of the stake to be offered has not yet 
been decided. However, the Saudi government usually offers stakes of around 30 
per cent in its companies.<br>

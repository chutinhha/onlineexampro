                to media reports in Japan, Apple is expected to introduce an 
                iPod-enabled cell phone. The new phone, which Apple is 
                developing with Japanese company Softbank, will be introduced 
                later this year in Japan. Softbank recently purchased Vodaphone 
                Japan, and will continue to develop next generation phones. 
                Softbank’s President, Masayoshi Son, was reported to have 
                recently met with Apple’s CEO, Steve Jobs, to chalk out a basic 
                agreement on how an Apple iPhone would be developed. Currently, 
                Japan uses its own priority cellular network and if one were to 
                purchase an Apple iPhone in Japan with the intention to use it 
                in North America, it simply wouldn’t work. As per reports, Apple 
                was developing plans internally to launch its own cell phones. 
                Apple already has a partnership with Motorola for integrating 
                iTunes into phones.</font></p>

                we talk of online retailing, Amazon’s name comes first to our 
                mind. But Amazon now has a serious competition with the growing 
                popularity of Otto. With sales of US$3.8 billion in 2005, Otto, 
                the German company, is now the world’s second-biggest online 
                retailer. The company has its roots in the mid-1990s when its 
                founder Michael Otto was part of an experimental project of Time 
                Warner to test the willingness of the residents of Orlando (USA) 
                to shop online, using a specially installed cable network. 
                Moving on, he acquired Crate &amp; Barrel in 1998 and converted it 
                into one of the fastest-growing retailers in the US with focus 
                on catalog and online sales. The Otto group notched up sales of 
                US $18.5 billion in 2005 and has 54,000 employees globally. Its 
                online sales portfolio includes all kinds of products such as 
                garments, sports goods, electronics and appliances. Otto Group’s 
                core business is still the German catalog, but it generates half 
                of its sales outside of Germany, including other European 
                countries, the US and parts of Asia. Michael Otto continues to 
                push into new areas of e-commerce. His current endeavour is a 
                “t-commerce” partnership with Microsoft that would allow 
                customers to buy from the Otto catalog using a TV, a remote 
                control, and a set-top box. Otto hopes to reach the millions of 
                people still not comfortable with the Internet through this. </font></p>

                the strained relationship between Iran and the US, the leading 
                French hypermarket chain, Carrefour, is planning to make an 
                entry into the Iran market. As per MAF LLC, Carrefour’s regional 
                partner, an entry in Iran is among the company’s business 
                expansion plans. However, nothing has been finalised as of now. 
                Market analysts say Carrefour is expected to start up to 14 
                stores in Iran in the next 5-6 years. The first store could come 
                up as early as in 2007 in Tehran. Iran’s retail market doesn’t 
                boast of many hypermarkets, something quite common in the GCC

                <img border="1" src="worldscan_3.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="105">Philips, 
                sponsors of FIFA World Cup 2006, got caught in a media row 
                recently. The company came in for heavy flak for offering an all 
                expense paid trip of Germany to watch the World Cup to 
                journalists in the Middle East in return of a “favourable 
                coverage” in their respective publications. The company sent 
                letters to a select group of journalists in the region, stating 
                that the one who gives the best coverage to Philips in the 
                period leading to the event will win the trip. The offer sparked 
                off a major controversy and a debate raged on the issue of 
                bribing journalists indirectly to get the media coverage. To 
                clear its stand, Philips issued a statement: “The issued Philips 
                letter to the media was merely part of our efforts to engage 
                with some targeted media and not an offer for coverage. If the 
                wordings of the letter led to some misrepresentation then we 
                sincerely apologize.”<br>

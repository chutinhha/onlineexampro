            was, arguably, the most eventful year in the history of Oman 
            Telecommunications Company SAOG (Omantel). Two major developments 
            that changed the telecom landscape in Oman had a major bearing on 
            Omantel. The first private telecom player — in the mobile segment — 
            made its entry as the second telecom company in the Sultanate. Then 
            came the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Omantel. On 28 July 2005, 
            Omantel shares were listed on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM).

            Landscape</b><br>
            The government has been following the liberalisation policy in the 
            telecom sector in line with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) 
            agreement. The introduction of a Telecom Act and establishment of 
            Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) is a step in that 
            direction. Currently, Omantel has 70 per cent ownership by the 
            government and 30 per cent by the private investors.<br>
            <br>
            Beginning March 2005, the market was thrown open with the entry of 
            the second telecom company in the mobile space. TRA intends to 
            further liberalise the market by issuing new licences related to 
            fixed telephony, public data and value added services. This will 
            transform Oman into a multi-player, vibrant and competitive market.
            <br>
            <br>
            It requires Omantel to adopt a flexible and lean operating model 
            with articulated business strategies along with competent workforce, 
            all sharing a commercial and business driven culture. Along this 
            line, the management of Omantel has adopted a strategy to transform 
            itself into a profit-oriented, competent and aggressive telecom 
            player, which also takes care of its social responsibilities. <br>
            <b><br>
            Financial Performance</b><br>
            Omantel’s top line increased significantly in 2005. The total 
            service revenues (comprising revenues from fixed line, Internet and 
            data, mobile services and in-payment and inter-connection services) 
            increased from RO 247.9 million in 2004 to RO 270.6 million in 2005. 
            This indicates a growth of 9.4 per cent. The total revenue is higher 
            by 1.3 per cent compared to the IPO prospectus projection of RO 
            267.1 million. <br>
            <br>
            The growth in total service revenues in the 2003-2005 period has 
            been mainly driven by the increase in mobile revenue, resulting from 
            an increase in the number of mobile — particularly prepaid — 
            subscribers. Fixed line revenues fell during the same period. 
            Aggregate Internet and data communications revenue gradually rose 
            during the same period. <br>
            <br>
            The increase in other revenue for the year 2005 is mainly due to 
            interconnection service provided to new mobile operator. (To comply 
            with TRA guidelines, the roaming expense, RO 4.5 million in 2005 and 
            RO 2.43 million in 2004, is removed from the total service revenue 
            and shown separately under operational expenses).<br>
            <br>
            The operating expenses increased by 15.4 per cent to RO 193.8 
            million in 2005 compared to RO 167.9 million in 2004. This has also 
            impacted the net profits of the company. “The increase in operating 
            expenditure is due to increase in international administration 
            expenses, depreciation, marketing and operating &amp; maintenance 
            expenses. The increase in operating expenses is to enhance the 
            network coverage and to comply with the quality of service 
            parameters that are required in a competitive scenario, ” defends 
            Saud Bin Nasser Al-Shaikili, Board Chairman, Omantel.<br>
            <br>
            Fixed line services: As reflected in the table (Segment Wise 
            Revenues — 2003-2005), the revenues from the fixed line services 
            (including national and international fixed line voice, prepaid 
            cards-Jibreen and payphones-Al Multaqa) have gone down in the 
            2003-2005 period. The average number of subscribers (including 
            pre-paid and payphone services) has gone up marginally (6 per cent) 
            from 235,037 in 2003 to 256,106 in 2005. The blended monthly average 
            revenue per user (ARPU) has declined from RO 28.5 in 2003 to RO 
            21.5.<br>
            <br>
            Internet and data services: The Internet and data communications 
            services of Omantel includes Internet dial-up, broadband services 
            (ADSL “PowerNet”), prepaid services (“Al Ufuq”) and Internet 
            dedicated services. It also includes leased circuits (domestic and 
            international services). <br>
            <br>
            Internet revenues have been on an upswing, going up from RO 6.7 
            million in 2003 to RO 10.7 million in 2005. The average Internet 
            subscribers, including broadband, have also gone up from 52,726 in 
            2003 to 72,689 in 2005. The average revenue per subscriber 
            year-on-year increased by 4.6 per cent in 2004 and by 11.5 per cent 
            in 2005. The average revenue per subscriber per month blended was RO 
            10.6 in 2003, which increased to RO 11.03 in 2004. In 2005, it was 
            RO 12.3. <br>
            <br>
            The major factor for the increase in APRU is the addition of 
            hi-speed broadband service (ADSL). In 2006, the Internet-based 
            revenues are expected to climb up further with Omantel recently 
            launching WiFi Wireless Internet service ‘Ibhar’. <br>
            Mobile services: The mobile services business of Oman Mobile, part 
            of Omantel Group, has registered a spectacular growth in 2005 
            despite the opening up of the mobile telecommunications sector. In 
            July 2005, the total subscriber base reached the one million mark. 
            In comparison, the average subscriber base was 528,657 in 2003. It 
            went up to 699,867 in 2004. As on April 2006, it stands close to 1.2 
            million. <br>
            <br>
            Talking about Oman Mobile’s good performance, Dr. Amer Bin Awadh Al 
            Rawas, Managing Director, Oman Mobile says, “Oman Mobile has been 
            able to double the number of subscribers through a number of 
            transformation steps that we took to change the company from a 
            government-owned utility public authority to a consumer and 
            market-oriented private sector company. This has resulted in an 
            increased interest from the community in our services. In 2005, we 
            came out with a large portfolio of services and achieved a full year 
            of successful production, launching over 25 products and services 
            that cater to every segment of the market in one year. We were, and 
            still are, ranked the largest telecommunication distribution channel 
            in Oman with over 11,000 points of sales by the end of 2005.”<br>
            <br>
            As a result of the fast track growth of the mobile business, Omantel 
            Group’s mobile revenues have overtaken that of fixed line revenues. 
            In 2005, mobile revenues were RO 163 million, accounting for 60 per 
            cent of the total revenues of the group. In comparison, the mobile 
            revenues were RO 110.2 million in 2003 and RO 146 million in 2004. 
            Evidently, the mobile segment has been the primary growth driver of 
            the Omantel Group’s revenues over the last three years, particularly 
            after the introduction of the prepaid services in 2001.<br>
            <br>
            However, the increase in the number of subscribers and competition, 
            leading to price cuts, has affected the blended mobile APRU as it 
            has decreased from RO 17.4 in 2003 to RO 14.3 in 2005.</font></p>

            Developments in 2005</b><br>
            In order to achieve significant growth in revenues and subscribers, 
            Omantel launched a series of initiatives in 2005. It introduced over 
            20 value-added mobile services. It took the initiative to introduce 
            managed network services to provide effective and efficient telecom 
            solutions to the government, banks and other major corporate 
            clients. It launched attractive and value-for-money consumer 
            promotions in mobile, fixed and Internet services. It also extended 
            customer service counters/distribution network with enhanced service 
            standards. <br>
            <br>
            In 2005, the company signed over RO 78 million worth of contracts, 
            mostly infrastructure-based expansion, covering both Omantel and 
            Oman Mobile. Over RO 51 million worth of contracts was signed for 
            Oman Mobile network expansion to provide seamless coverage to most 
            of the populated areas and major highways/roads. In the last 
            five-year plan (2001-2005) period, Omantel has invested RO 383 
            million in telecom infrastructure development.<br>
            <br>
            Another notable development of 2005 was the creation of Tejari Oman. 
            Omania E-Commerce, jointly promoted by Omantel, entered into a 
            partnership with Tejari, the Middle East premier online 
            business-to-business (B2B) marketplace. This new initiative will 
            enable both government departments and private sector organisations 
            to source goods and services through online trading hub, enhancing 
            transparency and lowering the costs associated with paper-based 
            procurement processes.</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">Omantel committed over RO 1 million to provide backbone telecom 
            infrastructure in Sohar Port. It is also working towards striking a 
            partnership with port authorities to establish management system in 
            the port in order to streamline the shipping process and customs 
            through a fully automated system. <br>
            <br>
            It has set up a joint venture, Infoline LLC, which is engaged in the 
            provision and management of call center services. Omantel has also 
            invested over RO 15 million in the FLAG (FALCON), which is in the 
            advanced stages of building a new resilient sub sea fibre optic loop 
            cable system. The system has two landing stations in Oman (Seeb and 
            Khasab). This project, once completed, will serve as the traffic hub 
            for carrying traffic across the Middle East and the Indian 
            subcontinent. It also signed a three-year agreement with Eutelsat 
            for the lease of a full transponder. <br>
            <br>
            All this, besides a host of other investments and programmes 
            undertaken by Omantel, is aimed at strengthening the infrastructure 
            to service not only the existing customer requirements but also for 
            building up the capability to meet the growing service demands. 
            These long-term investments must have impacted the bottom lines of 
            the group in the short run.<br>

            “We are optimistic and upbeat that our past efforts along with 
            organization-wide adoption of customer-focused business strategies 
            and processes would bring enormous success in the years to come and 
            we would be able to take the company to new heights,” exudes Saud.<br>

            Already, the first quarter results of 2006 have been quite 
            encouraging. The net profit has jumped by 9.6 per cent. As per the 
            un-audited figures released by the group, the net profit shot up 
            from RO 19.528 million in Q1 2005 to RO 21.408 million in Q1 2006. 
            The revenues also went up by 22.6 per cent from RO 63.578 million in 
            Q1 2005 to Ro 77.966 million in Q1 2006.<br>
            <br>
            Omantel has started the year 2006 on a positive note. Its bid for 
            the third mobile license in Yemen is close to success as the company 
            has been invited by the Yemeni authorities to work out the 
            modalities for the operations. It is a tremendous boost to the 
            company’s overseas expansion plans. <br>
            <br>
            Omantel also won a contract with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) to 
            build the infrastructure for the transmission network of PDO and for 
            linking its strategic sites through fibre optic cables on the one 
            hand, and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) equipment as well as 
            Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems on the other 
            hand. The contract’s value is RO 12.573 million. <br>
            <br>
            Omantel unveiled its new MPLS service at the recently held Comex 
            2006 Exhibition. It is a virtual private network (VPN) that is 
            provided through the Internet Protocol, which combines any flexible 
            contact over the telephone or the Internet in an effective and high 
            quality manner, safely delivering it through lease line services. 
            MPLS provides several levels of performance and has the ability of 
            delaying the flow of data and information. It also enables voice and 
            multimedia applications — all these facilities shall be available in 
            one network. <br>
            <br>
            Omantel has also recently launched the hi-speed wireless Internet 
            service (Wi-Fi) ‘Ibhar’. Dr. Mohammed Bin Ali Al-Wohaibi, Executive 
            President, Omantel informs, “The new service aims at attracting 
            large segment of laptop and mobile notebook users. It helps 
            subscribers visit the Internet while moving from one place to 
            another through hotspots made available in more than 12 locations in 
            public places. Thanks to these hot points, Wi-Fi users can easily 
            finish their jobs without the mess of wires.” Recently, Omantel also 
            launched WLL service project to connect the Sultanate’s rural 
            villages. This project will cover around 200 rural villages. <br>
            <br>
            Despite the impending threat from competition, Omantel believes 
            there still are opportunities to increase the customer base and 
            penetration levels in Oman. As the leading telecommunication service 
            provider, Omantel is strongly placed to compete with newcomers in 
            mobile as well as fixed segments. It enjoys the advantage of strong 
            national brands, fully built-out and up to date network, capable 
            workforce, national distribution as well as systems and processes in 
            place to provide and deliver services and support to the customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            While the company does accept the fact that competition will lead to 
            an erosion of market share in Oman, it also expects it to stimulate 
            growth of market. With the opening of the mobile market, Oman Mobile 
            witnessed an exponential growth in subscribers as well as revenues.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, liberalisation provides Omantel with opportunities to 
            grow internationally in markets, which have also opened up for 
            competition. The invitation by Yemen to Omantel to run mobile 
            services there is a good example of this. The competition also 
            provides Omantel with the opportunity to position itself as carrier 
            of carriers on the basis of its unique network position, thus 
            utilising the evolving competition to further business 
            opportunities. <br>
            <br>
            As per Omantel management’s statement in its Annual Report for year 
            2005, “The expected competition in the fixed line business may turn 
            into a serious threat if it is not properly implemented. Omantel 
            takes the view that competition is beneficial but that it needs to 
            be implemented in the right market at the right time and under the 
            right terms and conditions. While we are not certain how the 
            liberalisation policy would evolve, we are confident that TRA’s 
            sector policy would provide a balanced path to liberalisation 
            programmes based on the currently adopted way of consulting market 
            players before finalising the policy.”</font></p>

                <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Stock Performance</b><br>
                As part of the privatisation process, a portion of the share 
                capital was divested to public at a price of RO 1.28 in June 
                2005. In its first year as a listed company, Omantel’s net 
                profit for the year 2005 stood at RO 68.15 million as against RO 
                72.95 million compared to 2004, a decrease of 6.6 per cent on a 
                year on year (YoY) basis. This, in spite of the stability seen 
                in its core revenue! <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, a positive sign emanating from the financials 
                is the improvement in its other operating revenues whose main 
                contributor has been the interconnection revenues and external 
                administration revenues. <br>
                <br>
                Overall, the annualised earnings slipped from 97 baizas to 91 
                baizas on year to year basis. The stock is getting traded at P/E 
                multiple of 14.15, which is lower than the GCC telecom average 
                of 21. The share is worth RO 1.82 if we apply the P/E of 20 
                (slightly less than the GCC average of 21) to the 2005 earnings.
                <img border="0" src="dailypricechart.jpg" width="250" height="180" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2"><br>
                <br>
                However, there also are issues that require a major attention in 
                the financials. Royalty payment to the government is to be based 
                on net revenue, which was allowed by the government for the year 
                2004, in line with the international practice. However, the 
                company continues to make provisions based on gross revenue and 
                this could create a substantial impact (positive) on the bottom 
                line. The company has been reporting certain amounts under the 
                head “Items Awaiting Capitalization” for the past four years (RO 
                98 million). The company needs to clarify when the 
                capitalization will be carried out.<br>
                <br>
                Fundamentally and technically, the share looks sound. We may 
                expect the share to go to a level of RO 1.80 in the next 3 to 6 
                months time where both fundamental and technical targets 
                coincide. Hence we advise the investors to enter the share once 
                it crosses RO 1.37, keeping the stop loss at RO 1.29 . <i>- by

            It was an interesting disclosure by any yardstick. Talking to OER on 
            December 11, 2005 (the day Sohar Aluminium’s equity and technical 
            partners had gathered in Muscat to put their seal of approval to go 
            ahead with the development of the project in Sohar), Tony Kinsman, 
            the CEO, declared his company had the distinction of bringing in 
            Islamic finance to the shores of Oman. <br>
            <br>
            The comment, coming from a top CEO, perhaps, was a pointer to a 
            probable paradigm shift. Is this to be a trend? Is Islamic finance 
            (IF) on its way to Oman? <br>
            If we talk of the Muslim world, IF has been wildly successful in 
            Malaysia, accounting for 10 per cent of all banking operations 
            there. In the GCC region, Bahrain was the first to catch on to the 
            trend and promote the concept. And the UAE has seen a renewed push 
            in this sector in the recent times. <br>
            <br>
            Formally, Oman is not into IF. The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) does 
            not allow the local banks to deal in Islamic finance, banking or 
            insurance products. On that count, the Sultanate has a different 
            policy compared to its GCC peers like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar 
            or the UAE. But companies operating in the Sultanate are 
            increasingly climbing on to the IF bandwagon. There is heightened 
            interest in IF in Oman. As of now, the regional banks have moved in 
            to fulfil this need.<br>
            <br>
            Sohar Aluminium’s case is, probably, a pointer to the shape of 
            things to come. The first Greenfield aluminium smelter project in 
            over a quarter century in the entire Middle East, Sohar Aluminium is 
            raising US$260 million of the total US$ 1.58 billion project, from 
            the IF route. This makes up for around 15 per cent of the total 
            project finance. For the first time in Oman, a capital project is 
            probably availing of IF of this size. </font></p>

            Clearing the cloud further is Usman Ahmed, Deputy CEO of Citi 
            Islamic Investment Bank E. C. (CIIB) in Dubai, a 100 per cent-owned 
            subsidiary of Citigroup. He reveals to OER that his bank has 
            recently closed the first Islamic tranche for the Omani issuer — the 
            US$ 260 million Islamic facility for the Sohar Aluminium project.<br>
            <br>
            There are other examples as well. One of the reasonably large 
            diversified groups in the oil and gas sector in the Sultanate is 
            reported to have borrowed money for a transaction on an Islamic 
            basis. AES Barka, the 427 MW gas fired power plant and 20 MIGD 
            desalination plant, is also reported to have borrowed some of its 
            project finance through IF. A real estate sector company, and some 
            leasing companies are also reported to be interested in considering 
            the IF route. <br>
            <br>
            Rajeev Singh, Partner, Ernst &amp; Young, Oman, informs that his firm 
            was approached by a consortium of developers bidding to the 
            government on the Sohar Independent Water and Power Project. (They 
            did not go on to win the bid). Ernst &amp; Young, Oman, were their 
            financial advisors and had approached an IF institution to put in 
            almost US$200 million worth of project finance. </font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">Has IF arrived in Oman? “I think it 
            has definitely arrived,” argues Rajeev. “It has been a force in the 
            region for sometime. Oman government has been very pragmatic in 
            consciously trying to avoid linking religion with business. We 
            understand that the regulator doesn’t have a problem if you have 
            these (IF) products without specifically marketing it under that 
            tag. IF transaction and lending has been taking place in Oman for 
            the past few years, but quietly, and without a lot of publicity. But 
            businessmen continue to use that. It’s now a way of life in the 
            Middle East.” <br>
            <br>
            Is the trend likely to pick up in the future? Rajeev believes it has 
            to; it’s a fact of life across the region. A big development for 
            Islamic banks, points out Rajeev, is that while in the past it was 
            confined to retail business, and later corporate, the recent times 
            have seen the arrival of the Islamic component for project finance. 
            “You now see sizeable IF component forming part of project finance 
            tranches. Anything between 20 per cent and 35 per cent of project 
            finance transactions now comprise of Islamic tranches,” he informs.<br>
            <br>
            However, Khalid sees the non-standardization of IF banking 
            procedures as the biggest hurdle for its growth in Oman. This, he 
            views, as a problem with the structural element of the IF concept. 
            The Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank or the Dubai Islamic Bank have their 
            in-house Shariah boards, he points out. Malaysia, where IF is 
            breaking new ground, has set the benchmark for standardization. “We 
            don’t have this,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            Khalid then points to the problem relating to the marketability of 
            IF products. Here, he sees a big problem with liquidity, which he 
            says, is an issue with both IF and conventional products. The 
            primary market is low. However, change of hands is not taking place 
            in the secondary market. Khalid cites the example of Sukuk (Islamic 
            leasing bonds), which has done extremely well in the primary market. 
            In the secondary market, Sukuk has the attractiveness but not the 
            liquidity. Khalid says the prospect of IF looks bright in the 
            short-term. Petrodollars have made the market more attractive. “But 
            only when the secondary market sees transactions taking place, that 
            liquidity and attractiveness will come to the IF market.” <br>
            <br>
            Rajeev, on the other hand, sees a silver lining with regard to the 
            IF terms and conditions, which have been improving in recent times, 
            for example the tenure of the loan, the sort of paperwork and 
            documentation required, and the level of compliance etc. “In recent 
            times, IF has become easier to understand and easier to facilitate. 
            IF now has standard packages so there is no need to bother about 
            checking compliance from scholars. Bankers arrange all that. The 
            transaction process has become very smooth now,” says Rajeev.<br>
            <br>
            The eased procedures and the heightened interest bring us to back 
            the basic question: what is happening on the&nbsp; regional and 
            global maps? How far has IF’s reach grown? <br>
            <br>
            <b>IF: Third Generation </b><br>
            In fact, Muslim societies have always looked to means of conducting 
            their banking and investment affairs according to the Shariah, the 
            sacred law of Islam. However, the discovery of oil in the Arab world 
            in the 1930s brought about radical changes, stepping up the 
            challenge of compliance in the global economy. <br>
            <br>
            Today, there seems to be a growing interest in IF even in such parts 
            of the globe as Europe and North America, where Muslims are a 
            minority. And in the Middle East, IF may become a way of life! A 
            recent study illustrates that the Asia-Pacific region looks 
            promising as well, following estimates that Islamic banks will 
            account for 40 per cent to 50 per cent of total savings of the 
            Muslim population worldwide within the next eight to 10 years. <br>
            <br>
            Modern Islamic finance, clearly, has come a long way since it 
            appeared on the scene some 30 years ago. The industry is now seeing 
            a third generation of evolution. The concept as such started with 
            the creation of Islamic banks in the Middle East in the mid-1970s. 
            However, majority of their assets were either real estate or very 
            short-term, trading-type activities. <br>
            <br>
            The second generation lasted from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. Now, 
            Islamic banks were developing a bit more sophisticated corporate and 
            retail banking structures, trying to come up with better products 
            and a better level of service. From the mid-to late 1990s to the 
            present day, is the time for the third generation of IF 
            institutions. Sophisticated product offerings mark this phase. <br>
            <br>
            The first Islamic investment bank was founded in Bahrain in 1997. 
            Since then, several Western banks have set up Islamic windows, 
            including UBS Group’s Noriba Bank, Citigroup’s Citi Islamic 
            Investment Bank, and HSBC Amanah Finance. It is not unusual, now, to 
            find conventional banking models operating side by side with Islamic 
            banking systems. <br>
            <b><br>
            What They Offer</b><br>
            Islamic financial institutions typically offer such traditional 
            Islamic banking services as investments in Murabaha (instalment 
            sales), equity investments that conform to Shariah precepts, real 
            estate investment programs, treasury products, foreign exchange, and 
            private wealth, and portfolio management. An Islamic fund of hedge 
            funds is only the latest milestone in the development of Islamic 
            finance, an opportunity lying somewhere between US$200 billion and 
            US$300 billion.<br>
            <br>
            Islamic financing in the GCC in general, and Dubai in particular, 
            has seen a surge recently following the launch of Islamic banking 
            services by regional and international banks. <br>
            <br>
            “In fact, Islamic financing has grown in double digits from a low 
            statistical base. At some point in the future, growth rates will be 
            slower because the industry is maturing,” points out Dr. Eckart 
            Woertz, Program Manager, Economics, of the Dubai-based Gulf Research 
            Center.<br>
            <br>
            Adds Dr. Woertz: “Islamic financing has quite some potential in the 
            Islamic countries and among migrant communities in the West. But 
            much of its future growth depends on how it will be able to copy 
            conventional banking products, including project financing, options, 
            short selling.”<br>
            <br>
            “This in turn might raise discussions about its specific Islamic 
            identity, as boundaries to conventional banking become increasingly 
            blurred.”<br>
            <br>
            For example one can argue whether murahaba constructions are some 
            kind of disguised interest and in fact treasury departments of 
            Islamic banks, which invest in such vehicles use the LIBOR (London 
            Inter-bank Offered Rate) of conventional banking as a benchmark.<br>
            <br>
            That may be so for now. But in future Islamic financial institutions 
            will come under increasing competition. Will they be able to 
            withstand such competition from the likes of Citigroup, HSBC and 
            Deutsche Bank?<br>
            <b><br>
            They could, says Dr. Woertz.</b><br>
            It is not too difficult for a conventional bank to ease into Islamic 
            financing. The similarities are greater than the differences, says 
            Dr. Woertz, who says it is about risk management and the time value 
            of money... “Once a Shariah board is in place and there is 
            administrative separation of Islamic/non-Islamic accounts, there is 
            no problem. All the bigger banks, including Citi, HSBC, Deutsche etc 
            are venturing into the field since there is increasing business.”<br>
            <br>
            But Islamic banks will have to keep initiating new measures with 
            products that will be able to maintain profitability.<br>
            “The huge profit margins of Islamic Banks will decline once 
            investors become more sophisticated and demand some kind of profits 
            or ‘disguised interest’ on their current accounts. So far, the 
            Islamic Banks mostly get deposits at essentially no cost while 
            operating profitably with them on the consumer financing and 
            murahaba markets.”<br>
            <br>
            But what needs to be done in order for the industry to expand and 
            still corner more share of the international finance is to integrate 
            value with sustainable growth.<br>
            <br>
            The Islamic finance sector needs to do more to encourage socially 
            responsible investing (SRI), a recent forum in Dubai was told.<br>
            <br>
            Of particular interest and key to the moral dimension of investing 
            will be the parallels drawn between Islamic Finance and Socially 
            Responsible Investing (SRI), a strong and growing force in Europe 
            and the US, which aims to balance sustainable value to both society 
            at large and the shareholders by investing in companies who meet 
            their exacting standards of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
            <br>
            <br>
            “Islamic finance is rapidly maturing into a mainstream and powerful 
            financial industry, and Shariah-compliant disciplines are 
            accelerating into many new sectors,” according to Christianna 
            Tsiterou, Conference Director at IIR Middle East, organizers of the 
            9th International Islamic Finance Forum (IIFF) in Dubai.<br>
            <br>
            Probably the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), which 
            plans to list Islamic instrumnets at some stage can play a key role 
            in the development of Islamic financing.<br>
            <br>
            Islamic banking and financial institutions intending to operate out 
            of Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) must ensure a clear 
            division between senior management and company-appointed Shari’a 
            Supervisory Boards (SSBs), according to Hari Bhambra, Senior Manager 
            - Supervision at DIFC Financial Services Authority (DFSA).<br>
            <br>
            While a company’s board would hold ultimate responsibility for the 
            organisation’s operations, including its general compliance with 
            DIFC’s regulatory framework, as well as its Shari’a aspects, the SSB 
            would be responsible for approving the Shari’a aspects and reporting 
            to DFSA, adds Bhambra.<br>
            <br>
            But future growth in the GCC Islamic financial services industry 
            hinges on developing and introducing standardisation and innovation 
            of products and services.<br>
            <br>
            Says Dr. Habib Al Mulla, Chairman, Dubai Financial Services 
            Authority (DFSA), ‘The Islamic financial services industry should 
            seek to be as innovative as possible in terms of products and 
            services that they offer. The industry would greatly benefit from 
            standardisation of Islamic services and products, and this would 
            promote greater consistency across the industry.”<br>
            <br>
            Industry experts point out Islamic firms would greatly benefit by 
            being able to respond more quickly to the needs of clients, and not 
            be delayed by the legal and Shariah approval process.<br>
            <br>
            The DFSA considered many jurisdictions when devising its regime for 
            the DIFC as a whole and specifically Islamic finance. With respect 
            to Shari’a, the DFSA chose to act as a Shari’a Systems Regulator 
            rather than a Shari’a Regulator.<br>
            <br>
            ”For the future, the DIFC has established the Islamic Finance 
            Advisory Council its responsibility is to begin work with the 
            industry to identify the gaps and issues in the market, and then set 
            realistic timetables with a view to improving the operating 
            environment for Islamic finance. This is just a start. As a 
            regulator, we recognise that we along with the market have to 
            continue to evolve,” adds Dr. Al Mulla. Of equal importance is the 
            Citigroup Dow Jones Islamic bond index recently launched, to help 
            create a benchmark for Sukuks“But Sukuks as such are far from 
            constituting a benchmark, most of the time they are 5-year floating 
            rate notes and fixed coupon and government sukuks are rare. Thus a 
            benchmark all across the yield curve is not possible yet,” said Dr. 
            Woertz of GRC.<br>
            <br>
            The Dow Jones Citigroup Sukuk Index includes investment-grade, US 
            dollar-denominated Islamic bonds-also known as Sukuk-issued in the 
            global market. The Index tracks seven issues: Islamic Development 
            Bank, Solidarity Trust Services Ltd, BMA International Sukuk, Qatar 
            Global Sukuk, Malaysia Global Sukuk, Sarawak Sukuk and Dubai Global 
            Sukuk.<br>
            <br>
            To be included in the Index, an Islamic bond must comply with both 
            Shariah law and the Bahrain-based Auditing &amp; Accounting Organization 
            of Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) standards for tradable 
            Sukuk. Once a bond meets these criteria, Dow Jones Indexes and 
            Citigroup will apply market-based criteria such as minimum maturity 
            of one year, minimum issue size of US$250 million, and an explicit 
            or implicit rating of at least BBB-/Baa3 by leading rating agencies.

            <br>
            Bahrain is increasingly emerging as the undisputed capital of 
            Islamic finance. This notion is supported by continued advances made 
            in the sector. <br>
            <br>
            To begin with, some 30 Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) operate 
            in Bahrain. These include investment IFIs like Gulf Finance House 
            (GFH) or commercial banking entities such as Shamil Bank. Still, 
            other leading banks such as Citibank and Arab Banking Corporation 
            have dedicated units catering to Islamic finance in Bahrain. <br>
            <b><br>
            Supportive Institutions</b><br>
            To be sure, Bahrain is well placed to lay claim on being the primary 
            hub for Islamic finance by virtue of supportive institutions in 
            place. Already, Bahrain plays host to numerous institutions 
            promoting and organising Islamic banking activities, like the 
            International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM). Set up in November 
            2001 by several Muslim countries and Saudi-based Islamic Development 
            Bank, IIFM serves as a money market for Islamic institutions 
            worldwide. In turn, this is sustained through Liquidity Management 
            Centre (LMC), which helps realising IIMF’s objective. <br>
            <br>
            Set up in July 2002, LMC provides a platform for IFIs to manage 
            their day-to-day liquidity requirements. In particular, LMC manages 
            the sale of Islamic leasing bonds, better known as Sukuks. In short, 
            LMC intends to develop an active secondary market for short-term 
            Shariah-compliant treasury products. <br>
            <br>
            To add to it all, the International Islamic Rating Agency (IIRA) is 
            based in Bahrain. Set up in 2002 as a pioneering project, IIRA 
            extends ratings to IFIs and other Shariah-compliant products. As 
            such, the global banking industry’s necessary infrastructure is 
            based in Bahrain. <br>
            <b><br>
            Serious Regulations </b><br>
            Financial authorities in Bahrain regard Islamic banking sector as 
            one with extraordinary growth potential. Not surprisingly, the 
            government is keen to promote Islamic banking by providing a 
            supportive regulatory environment, with emphasis placed on high 
            standards, transparency and accountability. <br>
            <br>
            The Prudent Information and Regulatory Framework for Islamic Banks 
            (Piri) came into effect in 2002. Piri requires&nbsp; Islamic banks 
            to maintain a capital-adequacy ratio of 12 per cent. In fact, the 
            Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial 
            Institutions (AAOIFI) is based in Bahrain too. According to 
            International Monetary Fund (IMF), Islamic finance houses anywhere 
            are mandated to follow standards set by AAOIFI. <br>
            <br>
            Other regulations are in place in dealing with asset quality, 
            management of investment accounts and liquidity. In 2003, BMA signed 
            a memorandum of understanding with the London Metal Exchange (LME) 
            to develop contracts and documents that abide by Islamic law. The 
            final aim of the deal is to assist IFIs conduct transactions on the 
            LME.<br>
            <b><br>
            Innovative Businesses</b><br>
            In many respects, Bahrain-based IFIs are noted for their innovative 
            business ideas. They are credited for standing behind a number of 
            property-related projects across the region. <br>
            <br>
            For example, GFH is leading force behind Bahrain Financial Harbour, 
            the US$1.3 billion project, set to become the country’s main 
            financial district by 2007. Also, GFH is the financial advisor to 
            the newly launched Qatar Energy City. In fact, Essam Janahi, Chief 
            Executive Officer of GFH, serves as chairman on the board of Qatar 
            Energy City, whose first phase will be built at the cost of US$1.6 
            billion. Besides, promoters expect to launch a stock market 
            dedicated to trading in oil and gas derivatives, as part of Qatar 
            Energy City project.<br>
            <br>
            Also, GFH shows that IFIs can be profitable — it posted net profit 
            of US$57 million in the first quarter of 2006, up 75 per cent from 
            the same period in 2005. <br>
            <b><br>
            Bright Future </b><br>
            The IMF believes that Islamic banking extends opportunities to 
            Bahrain’s financial services sector. The point was made during the 
            financial sector assessment programme (FSAP) review of Bahrain, 
            released in March. Says IMF: “The variety and popularity of Islamic 
            instruments has surged in recent years, driven mainly by the supply 
            of funds from savers who wish to invest in Islamic vehicles, and to 
            a lesser extent, by entrepreneurs seeking financing using Islamic 
            instruments. The growth is likely to remain rapid over the near 
            term.”<br>
            <br>
            In fact, according to FSAP’s report, Islamic banking is assisting 
            Bahrain remain an attractive location for financial institutions. 
            Likewise, the IMF’s report noted growing demand for Islamic 
            insurance in Bahrain. Islamic insurance activity is known as 
            Takaful. <br>
            <br>
            Suffice to say that the financial services sector, which includes 
            Islamic banking, is the main contributor to Bahrain’s gross domestic 
            product (GDP). In 2004, the sector accounted for 24. 2 per cent of 
            the GDP in constant prices, up from around 19 per cent in 2003. 
            Activities related to the financial services sector, namely 
            investment banking, advisory and management services, grew by a 
            hefty 35 per cent in 2004.<br>
            <br>
            The challenge to financial authorities in Bahrain lies in continuing 
            the drive to encourage development and introduction of innovative 
            Islamic banking products. And there are numerous indications that 
            Islamic financial institutions operating in Bahrain plan to remain 
            innovative while taking calculative risk. For instance, Kuwait 
            Finance House (Bahrain) has recently revealed plans to set up KFH 
            Industrial Oasis within Bahrain International Investment Park 
            (BIIP). KFH’s project intends to stimualte diversification within 
            Bahrain’s industrial sector by building on growing demand for 
            indudstrial-based real estate projects in the country. <br>
            <br>
            In short, Islamic finance is bound to remain an agent of change in 
            Bahrain’s vital financial servcies sector.<br>
            <br>
            It has never been this good for Islamic finance in Qatar. In recent 
            times, three local conventional banks have branched out and launched 
            Islamic financial entities. Qatar market is witnessing an escalation 
            in competition in this area — in providing Shariah-compliant 
            products and services to the local clientele. <br>
            <br>
            Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), that started its operations in 1983, is 
            the pioneer in the field. Its local investments exceed 70 per cent 
            of its gross investments. With assets standing at QR8.294 billion, 
            QIB’s success is proof of the readiness of the market for 
            competition. <br>
            <br>
            And that’s why conventional banks have joined the bandwagon. QNB Al 
            Islami, Al Safa (Commercialbank) and Doha Islami (Doha Bank) join 
            Qatar Islamic and Qatar International Islamic Banks. “In countries 
            such as the UAE and Saudia Arabia, both such models of banking have 
            simultaneously existed for a long time. It should be construed as 
            ‘healthy competition’ as it keeps everybody on their toes in terms 
            of coming up with offerings that are value packed. Qatar is now 
            experiencing the same and I am optimistic that it will contribute 
            positively in all aspects,” says Mohammad I Mandani, Deputy CEO and 
            Head of Islamic Banking, Al Safa Islamic Banking. “Conventional 
            banks opening up Islamic branches only proves how popular the 
            concept has become. And this increased competition will only being 
            about improved quality in products and services,” according to a QIB 
            spokesperson. <br>
            <br>
            Islamic finance is indeed coming of age in Qatar. It is no longer a 
            unique or niche service, as its appeal crosses religious and 
            national boundaries. It is probably a little intriguing why this 
            concept of banking had not found wider favour earlier here. <br>
            <br>
            QIB, the leading Islamic bank in Qatar, has ventured overseas in its 
            expansion. It has stepped forward to lead the establishment of three 
            finance houses in Europe, Asia and the USA. Musadag El Melik, Head 
            of QNB Al Islami, says the basic concept of Islamic banking is 
            something that is built on the ethical beliefs or principles of not 
            just Muslims, but also of the two other major religions — Judaism 
            and Christianity. “Usury is banned in all three religions. So we are 
            providing a service that is interest-free. So we can simply look at 
            this form of banking as ‘interest-free banking’ — as one economic 
            concept. Yes, there is more than just being interest-free, we will 
            not invest in what is prohibited — alcohol, tobacco, gambling etc. 
            But those may well be the principles of those who are not Muslims 
            too.”<br>
            <br>
            Businesses Seek It Too “The Qatari market has become so appealing 
            that there is excellent opportunity for investing locally in 
            Shariah-compliant projects. That is why so many new players are 
            entering the market,” says the QIB official. <br>
            <br>
            Recently, Dolphin Energy Limited signed what is considered the 
            biggest Shariah-compliant financing agreement ever. Dolphin Energy 
            signed an Islamic financing agreement with 14 financial institutions 
            that will provide $1 billion to finance a portion of the Dolphin Gas 
            Project. Dolphin had earlier appointed five banks with Shariah 
            Supervisory Committees to lead the financing. <br>
            <br>
            Dolphin also invited other banks, including a number that had never 
            invested in Islamically structured financing facilities before, to 
            join the financing. <br>
            <b><br>
            Key Challenges </b><br>
            The Islamic finance industry is comparatively young. Therefore, the 
            there will be challenges.<br>
            <br>
            One of the key challenges is the relatively small talent pool of 
            qualified personnel to run Shariah-compliant programs.<br>
            <br>
            Another obstacle is the lack of uniform standards. Differences in 
            approach can make it difficult for professionals who try to adapt 
            their financial business practices in one Islamic country to 
            another. <br>
            <br>
            Islamic banks looking to compete in the global economy must 
            eventually align themselves with Basel II, the international banking 
            standard. This means developing the necessary technological 
            capability and operating procedures. However, conventional banks 
            that already comply with Basel II and decide to enter the Islamic 
            banking business, must reengineer their processes to make their 
            activities Shariah-compliant. <br>
            <br>
            Then, assessing the performance of Islamic banks is often 
            confounding for experienced regulators, let alone newcomers to the 
            sector. The problem is a lack of adequate transparency and 
            disclosure. This is the other big challenge.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, there is the persistent skepticism that interest in IF is 
            being driven by marketing needs rather than the sector’s own merits.

                <font face="Verdana" size="1">Malaysia presents a particularly 
                interesting case. Although it has a completely secular financial 
                system in place, the country claims to have the highest Islamic 
                banking growth rate in the world. The government is reportedly 
                aiming at increasing the share of Islamic financial services 
                providers to 20 per cent of the banking and insurance (or 
                Takaful) industry by 2010. <br>
                <br>
                Malaysia has a good chance to be an international Islamic 
                financial centre, Bank Negara Malaysia Governor, Tan Sri Dr Zeti 
                Akhtar Aziz, recently said in Malaysia after launching AmIslamic 
                Bank Bhd, AmBank Group’s Islamic banking subsidiary.<br>
                <br>
                Recent reports have pointed out Malaysia might just lose its 
                status as the world’s second largest Islamic banking hub after 
                Bahrain to Singapore as the island state was actively pursuing 
                this interest by capitalising on its status and strength as a 
                major Asian financial centre.<br>
                <br>
                The Singapore Government also announced two new tax incentives 
                for Islamic finance in its fiscal budget announcements, in order 
                to attract more foreign investors into its Islamic financial 
                system.<br>
                <br>
                Singapore does have an edge because of the progressive methods 
                incorporated by the Islamic scholars there.<br>
                <br>
                “The shift in thinking among the scholars who were able to keep 
                up with modern times and the contemporary requirements and 
                approved novel ‘asset migration’ techniques played a key role in 
                the development of Islamic financing,” according to Mohd Alami 
                Musa, President, the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura – Islamic 
                Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS).<br>
                <br>
                Singapore has over 100 wakafs, which have more than US$250 
                million in assets.<br>
                <br>
                The MUIS received recently the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al 
                Maktoum Islamic Finance Awards in Dubai for the Musharaka bonds 
                through which the Bencoolen Mixed Development project was 
                successfully executed.<br>
                <br>
                However, even though the global environment is competitive, 
                Malaysia’s Islamic banking is well supported by the people as 
                well as the regulatory infrastructure, which is already in 
                place.<br>
                <br>
                Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz says Malaysia still has the competitive edge 
                to become the international Islamic financial centre due to the 
                country’s comprehensive Islamic financial system.<br>
                <br>
                Islamic banking assets in Malaysia amount to US$31.37 billion 
                (RM113.5 billion), the takaful assets, US$1.63 billion (RM5.9 
                billion), the approved Islamic bonds in 2005, over US$11.05 
                billion (RM40 billion), and the Islamic money market recorded a 
                sizeable monthly turnover of US$37.36 billion (RM135.2 billion).<br>
                <br>
                With two full-fledged Islamic banking institutions and the three 
                new foreign Islamic banking players, Malaysia now has 12 Islamic 
                banking institutions operating under its Islamic Banking Act.</font></td>

                <font face="Verdana" size="1">Citibank has been in Islamic 
                financing for over 25 years. The bank’s London operations were 
                set up way back in 1981. Citigroup was also the first 
                international institution to set up a separately capitalized 
                Islamic bank. Citi Islamic Investment Bank E. C. (CIIB) was 
                incorporated in July 1996 in Bahrain, as a 100 per cent owned 
                subsidiary of Citigroup. Usman Ahmed, Deputy CEO of CIIB tells 
                Michael Clarence in Dubai how Citi views the future of Islamic 
                Finance. Excerpts:<br>
                <b><br>
                What prospects does Citi see in Islamic finance?</b><br>
                We have long-term commitment to Islamic banking. The industry 
                continues to grow from a geographic as well as product 
                perspective. <br>
                <b><br>
                At what rate do you think Islamic financing will grow worldwide?</b><br>
                Currently, Islamic financing is estimated to be in the region of 
                US$300 billion to US$350 billion. While the industry size and 
                historical growth has not been precisely documented, it is 
                expected to continue growing at the estimated historical rate of 
                10-15 per cent per annum in the foreseeable future. <br>
                <b><br>
                How difficult it was for a global bank like yours to ease into 
                Islamic financing?</b><br>
                As mentioned, Citigroup has longstanding involvement and 
                commitment to Islamic banking. More and more international banks 
                are offering Islamic financing instruments through Islamic 
                windows as the industry gets increasingly integrated with 
                mainstream capital markets. There are no significant barriers to 
                entry for an international bank to venture into Islamic banking.
                <br>
                <br>
                What Islamic financing products do you currently offer? Is the 
                demand for your products increasing in the Arab world?<br>
                Historically, we have focused on Islamic corporate and project 
                finance, capital markets, advisory and derivative products. 
                Citigroup has been a leader in Islamic structured debt 
                transactions and has played a pioneering role in the development 
                of the Sukuk Market.<br>
                <b><br>
                Can you point out major Shariah-compliant deals led by Citi 
                Islamic in the past few years?</b><br>
                With CIIB’s active involvement, Citigroup was lead-manager and 
                bookrunner on four out of five sukuk offerings in 2004, 
                including the Dubai Civil Aviation US$1 billion debut sukuk 
                offering, the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) US$250 million 
                issue, the Saxony-Anhalt Euro 100 million debut offering and the 
                Government of Pakistan US$600 million Sukuk. <br>
                <br>
                We have also arranged for a US$260 million Islamic component for 
                Sohar Aluminium last year out of a total financing facility of 
                US$1.58 billion. In 2005, CIIB was the mandated lead arranger 
                and bookrunner for US$1 billion Islamic loan for Dolphin Energy 
                Ltd. While the general syndication was done last year, some 
                parts of it were completed during the first quarter of 2006. <br>
                <b><br>
                Which countries in the Arab world have the potential to become 
                like Malaysia in Islamic financing?</b><br>
                We are talking about slightly different market dynamics here. In 
                Malaysia, there is a regulatory focus on increasing the share of 
                Islamic banking assets to 20 per cent by the year 2010. And 
                Malaysia has a large domestic capital market. The Middle East is 
                largely US Dollar-denominated, as most regional currencies are 
                pegged to the dollar. The domestic capital market is therefore 
                not as large as that of Malaysia where most Islamic issuance is 
                Ringitt denominated under regulatory encouragement and 
                supervision. The Bahrain Monetary Authority (BMA) for a long 
                time, and, of late, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) 
                are playing important roles in developing Islamic capital 
                markets and encouraging the setting up of new Islamic banks and 
                windows.<br>
                <b><br>
                What is Oman’s status in the Islamic financing world?</b><br>
                We have recently closed the first Islamic tranche for an Omani 
                issuer – this is a US$ 260 million Islamic facility for the 
                Sohar Aluminium project. It is part of an overall deal of US$ 
                1.58 billion. <br>
                <br>
                Has the Citigroup Dow Jones Islamic bond index been successful 
                so far in helping create a benchmark for sukuks?<br>
                The index was established to promote secondary market liquidity 
                of existing Sukuk issues and encourage future issuance. It will 
                also serve as a benchmark for measuring and tracking performance 
                as well as a reference point for developing Islamic derivative 
                and investment products. <br>
                <br>
                Even though the Sukuk market has made great strides in the 
                recent past, it still has a long way to go and such initiatives 
                will serve to accelerate the pace of integration of Islamic 
                finance with mainstream capital markets. <br>
                <b><br>
                There is an opinion that most of the time, Sukuks are 5-year 
                floating rate notes (FRNs). Fixed coupon and government Sukuks 
                are rare. Thus, a benchmark all across the yield curve is not 
                possible yet. What is your view on this?</b><br>
                It is true that most Sukuk issuance to date has been on a 
                five-year, FRN format. However, in future, we do anticipate 
                issuance across the yield curve as the scope of the Sukuk 
                product expands. The recent US$3.5 billion PCFC Sukuk has a 
                tenor of two years. We can also expect to see real estate and 
                project financing Sukuk issues with longer tenors in the 
                imminent future.</font></td>

                </b><br>
                Western investment bankers, according to recent media reports, 
                are on a talent hunt. They are scouting&nbsp; for 
                financially-literate Islamic scholars. Leading banks in the 
                West, say reports, are moving quickly to locate&nbsp; Islamic 
                experts who can issue religious edicts approving new financial 
                products, such as “Islamic” bonds, loans or hedge funds. <br>
                <br>
                One of the key challenges with Islamic finance or banking is 
                that there are very few Islamic scholars who command enough 
                religious respect to issue fatwas, understand the complexities 
                of global structured financial products, and have the kind of 
                language skills required to read the necessary market 
                documentation in both Arabic and English.<br>
                Finding qualified personnel to create, monitor, and administer 
                Shariah-compliant products and services often means training 
                conventional bankers (they may not even be Muslims). <br>
                <br>
                Although a number of universities in Muslim countries offer 
                business courses guided by Islamic principles, the industry 
                stills lacks widely recognized certification programs. <br>
                <br>
                This shortcoming, coupled with the fact that investment bankers 
                are rushing to expand their business in the Middle East amid an 
                oil price boom, ensured a real shortage of Islamic scholars, who 
                are hard to get. Being short in supply, they are reportedly 
                being constantly whizzed around the world in planes. <br>
                <br>
                According to Humayon Dar, managing director of the Dar Al 
                Istithmar insitute, a London-based Shariah&nbsp; consultancy, 
                “There are perhaps 150 (such scholars) worldwide who are 
                involved with Islamic finance but only&nbsp; 20 are 
                internationally recognized.”</font></td>

                  Mudarabah is a profit-and-loss-sharing contract whereby a 
                  professional manages the capital of a group of investors. In 
                  Islamic banking, the bank acts as a mudarib 
                  (entrepreneur-borrower) and manages the funds of the 
                  depositors in order to generate profits, in which the 
                  depositors share. The bank uses the depositors’ funds on a 
                  mudarabah (profit-sharing) basis. That is, the bank acts as 
                  both the entrepreneur-borrower on the saving side of the 
                  equation and as the rabbul-mal (owner of capital) on the

                  ownership. For example, Muslims seeking home financing at

                  In Islamic law, Riba is defined as excess, either in quantity 
                  or term, in the counter-values of whatever is 
                  exchanged—currency, commodities, goods, or anything else — in 
                  a variety of sales, purchases, swaps, or loans. In one 
                  explanation, riba is forbidden because it is predatory or 
                  exploitative, and produces profit at another person’s expense.</font></li>

                  <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Risk Sharing </b><br>
                  Contrary to popular perception, Islamic banking is not 
                  monolithic, nor can Islamic finance be neatly summed up as a 
                  prohibition against charging interest (riba), as it is often 
                  portrayed in the media. Riba, as described in Islamic 
                  jurisprudence, is a forced, or demanded, exchange of 
                  quantities that gives one party an advantage over another. 
                  Because it can be predatory, riba is considered unjust. For 
                  example, riba in a loan is prohibited because the lender is 
                  guaranteed a profit whether the borrower has gained or lost on 
                  the transaction. Conventional mortgages are regarded as 
                  exploitative in part because the mortgage-holder does not 
                  share in the homeowner’s risk. </font></li>

                </b><br>
                Not many know that Islamic Finance is more expensive compared to 
                its conventional counterpart, says Rajeev Singh, Partner, Ernst 
                &amp; Young, Oman. “A couple of clients in Oman have chosen to have 
                financing with Islamic banks. The most recent is the case of a 
                client who is paying 3-4 per cent higher finance charges only 
                because he wants to have IF as part of his portfolio,” he adds.<br>
                <br>
                According to Farmida Bi, a partner at the Denton Wilde Sapte law 
                firm in the UK, “It’s hard to get hold of Islamic scholars and 
                their fees are getting higher.”<br>
                <br>
                The fees charged for Shariah advice are a closely guarded 
                secret. However, some investment banks say they have paid up to 
                US$500,000 for advice on large capital markets transactions, a 
                dramatic increase from the levels seen a few years ago.</font></td>

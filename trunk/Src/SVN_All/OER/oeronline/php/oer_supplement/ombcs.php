        Oman Mobile strives with its developing services to provide high quality

        towers which adhere to international standards as well as meeting 
        environmental safety standards in their design and installation.<br>
        Before establishing any new power station, Oman Mobile conducts the 
        necessary field study to find the areas that require power stations. 
        Oman Mobile sets them across road lines and high in mountain areas to 
        extend symmetrically and in harmony with the Omani environment as more 
        than 1209 towers cover the districts of Oman to enhance the basic 
        foundation. <br>
        <br>
        Recently Oman Mobile accomplished a project (stage 7) to cover Al-Dakhiliya, 
        Al-Dhahira, and Al-Sharqiya regions by setting 38 power stations and 
        expanding 32 current stations. The company also provided a complete 
        coverage on strategic roads in the regions of Bidbid, Sur, Muscat and 
        Nizwa. This included setting 12 stations for a continuous service in the 
        main and significant areas in these roads. Another project accomplished 
        by Oman Mobile (stage 8) is covering the regions of Al-Batina, Al-Wusta, 
        Musandam, and Al-Buraimi by setting 110 new stations. Oman Mobile’s 
        network covers more than 95 per cent of Oman’s area and its services are 
        spread over more than 3482 residential areas through its power stations 
        and towers located on the strategic and secondary roads and all the

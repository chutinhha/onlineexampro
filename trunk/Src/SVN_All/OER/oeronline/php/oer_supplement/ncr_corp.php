        Corporation has announced that Habib Hanna will assume the role of the 
        General Manager for its branch in Oman. Hanna will be responsible for 
        driving the overall strategic development of NCR in Oman and managing 
        the NCR branch across all its business units. Hanna has an impressive 
        successful track record in sales and business management with different 
        organizations, with the last five years leading the NCR payment systems 
        division for the Middle East and North Africa region — based in Dubai. 
        He did an outstanding job with NCR in developing its payment business, 
        maintaining its leader position, and connecting with governments, banks, 
        central banks, and other customers and partners in the area.<br>
        <br>
        Commenting on his appointment, Hanna said: “I am delighted to take over 
        this position — as Oman is evolving as one of the most important markets 
        for us in the area. NCR has a great heritage of success in the 
        sultanate, where we were always the pioneers in introducing the latest 
        technologies. My focus will be to continue the success and growth that 
        we have achieved so far, reinforce the NCR’s corporate vision and 
        direction in the country, work very closely with our customers to build 
        on the existing relationships and partner with them to achieve their 
        business objectives, and to deliver great value to the market by taking 
        Oman to the forefront of technology.”<br>
        <br>
        About the various solutions that NCR is deploying in the Sultanate, 
        Hanna stated: “We are offering integrated Information and Communication 
        Technology (ICT) solutions in the field of Financial Solutions (ATMs, 
        Bill Payment, etc.), Teradata Enterprise Data Warehousing (EDW) &amp; 
        Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Contact Centers, Retail 
        Solutions (web kiosks/ Point of Sales, etc.), Cheque Processing and 
        Imaging Solutions, high-quality document and media consumables, Turnkey 
        ICT infrastructure &amp; Business solutions, as well as Lifecycle support 
        and Managed Services for critical IT environments.”<br>
        <br>
        Responding to the Commitment that NCR has for Oman, Hanna added: ”NCR 
        has been operating in the Sultanate since 1965 with over 40 years of 
        experience in meeting the various technological and business needs of 
        the country. We keep on investing in Resources and Infrastructure. 
        Today, our commitment to Oman goes even further where we have opened an 
        NCR facility — Oman Customer Care Center (CCC) located in the Knowledge 
        Oasis Muscat (KOM). The objective of this center is to provide around 
        the Clock Managed Services support for the whole region — from Network 
        and Systems Management, to ATM Channel &amp; Incident Management, to 
        Helpdesk services. A Team of highly trained specialists monitor our 
        customer’s networks and devices, reacting to alerts and status messages 
        and then remotely resolving the incident or dispatching an NCR field 
        engineer to the customer site, via our Field Support Centre located 
        within the same operation. The Center today has the infrastructure and 
        capabilities to deliver the full suite of NCR Managed Services portfolio 
        for the whole region. As part of a Global service delivery organization, 
        the NCR Oman operation is further enhanced through our Knowledge Driven 
        Services approach. Access to our Teradata Data Base, which captures 
        around 18,000 transactions per day (worldwide), enables NCR to deliver 
        more value add in the form of root cause analysis, recommendations and 
        trend analysis which ultimately can drive costs out of our customers’ 
        business — while simultaneously improving service levels to a great 
        extent.”<br>

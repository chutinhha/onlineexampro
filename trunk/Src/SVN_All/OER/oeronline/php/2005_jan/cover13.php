            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Tourism has become 
            a major focus in the development endeavour of the Sultanate since 
            the mid 1990s when the vision for Oman’s Economy: Oman 2020 was 
            launched and adopted as the long-term development strategy for the 
            country. It comprised four main dimensions, namely, the macro 
            economic framework, human resource development, economic 
            diversification and development of the private sector. <br>
            <br>
            The top priority sectors of the economic diversification are 
            large-scale gas-based industries, tourism and fisheries being the 
            most promising sectors in view of the Sultanate’s huge resource 
            endowment in all three. Objectives, policies and mechanisms aimed at 
            accelerating the growth of the tourism sector are spelled out in the 
            Fifth and Sixth Five Year development plans (1996-2000 and 2001-05).<br>
            <br>
            The impact of these plans on the tourism sector is well manifested 
            in the improvement of the development indicators related to the 
            sector. Taking a quick look at some of these indicators for the 
            five-year period 1990-2003, it will be found that the value added 
            (GDP of the sector) increased from RO53.6 million in 1999 to RO60.5 
            million in 2003, or at an average annual growth rate of 3.1 per 
            cent. The number of hotels increased to 133 in 2003 as compared to 
            102 in 1999, whereas the number of beds has increased from 7,573 to 
            9,778 – i.e., an annual average growth rate of 6.6 per cent during 
            the period under reference. <br>
            <br>
            These developments have raised the number of tourists visiting the 
            Sultanate to more than 1 million at present. We expect this trend to 
            continue during 2005 and beyond. This is not wishful thinking – 
            rather, it is an optimistic outlook in view of the Sultanate’s 
            diversified tourism potential which include beaches, mountains, 
            habitat areas vast deserts, caves and waddis. These assets would 
            provide the Sultanate with great opportunities to develop a variety 
            of tourist products such as eco-tourism, adventure, golf tourism, 
            Saharan tourism, nature tourism and cultural tourism, to name only 
            some of the attractions. <br>
            <br>
            The private sector is thus seen by us as a strategic partner and the 
            engine of economic growth in general and of the tourism sector in 
            particular. Obviously, public investment in the tourism sector in 
            the current and certainly in the Seventh Five Year Development Plans 
            would be geared towards building this strategic partnership and 
            facilitate success by strengthening existing infrastructure, 
            promoting the incentive packages directed to the private sector, 
            both domestic and foreign, and augmenting the private sector 
            investment outlays in tourism projects.<br>
            <br>
            As for the key projects in the pipeline, there are many such 
            projects – some of them are large scale, which will certainly have a 
            positive impact on the overall growth and development of the 
            national economy at large. Barr Al Jissah in the Muscat Governorate 
            is an example. This project is expected to embrace three world-class 
            hotels. The project is a 40:60 JV between the government and the 
            private sector. Another key project in the pipeline is The Wave – 
            also a JV between the two sectors. Its components include, but are 
            not limited to, a golf course, three hotels, marina, commercial 
            centre, diving and water sport centre and residential areas. Work on 
            these two projects is already underway.<br>
            <br>
            Other large-scale projects include Al Sawadi Tourism Development 
            Project in Al Batinah Region, which is an integrated resort 
            comprising accommodation, entertainment and sport facilities, the 
            golf project in Muscat and the development of Misfat Al-Abriyyeen as 
            a heritage destination.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
            I would like also to share with you the capacity and capability of 
            the tourism sector in creating employment opportunities for Omanis. 
            Being labour intensive by its nature, the sector is expected to 
            generate considerable employment opportunities in 2005 and beyond, 
            thus enabling the national economy achieve one of the top priority 
            objectives of Vision 2020. Moreover, unlike other economic 
            activities, employment in the tourism sector is more secure and less 
            affected by the fast technological changes and advancements.<br>
            <br>
            In our world of today, information and communication technology 
            plays an important role in enhancing production and productivity in 
            both goods and services sectors. That is why countries that have 
            acquired these technologies and became extremely advanced in 
            high-tech are today’s forerunners in socio-economic growth and 
            development. <br>
            <br>
            We, in the Ministry of Tourism, are fully aware of this fact and are 
            working currently towards building a reliable database of all 
            tourism products that is easily accessible internally and abroad, 
            especially to visitors of the Sultanate from the present and future 
            tourists sources. The Ministry’s new Website, currently under 
            negotiation with a private IT company, is intended as a vehicle for 
            promoting and marketing the sector. <br>
            <br>
            It is worth noting here that our marketing and promotional 
            activities are not confined to the information provided by the 
            Website. It includes another venues such as special programmes in 
            reputed TV channels and radio stations, articles published in 
            specialised and renowned magazines and newspaper. The Ministry is 
            also very active in utilising travel and tourism exhibitions 
            worldwide in view to the importance of these exhibitions in 
            marketing the Sultanate as a distinguished destination in addition 
            to a wide range of brochures and road shows planned to be carried 
            out in the near future in some target markets.</font></p>

                        from Maersk Contractors Norge AS (MCN). Renaissance 
                        Chairman Samir Fancy stated on behalf of the Board of 
                        Directors: “We are delighted with the strategic 
                        implications of this initiative. The company’s Contract 
                        Services Group has expanded its capabilities to include 
                        offshore catering; the acquisition strengthens 
                        Renaissance’s core focus in the oil &amp; gas sector; 
                        underlines our international ambitions; and, most 
                        importantly, provides a platform for synergy between the 
                        group’s services businesses and marine &amp; energy 
                        businesses in key markets including the Gulf and the 
                        Caspian.”<br>
                        <br>
                        In related moves, Renaissance has announced the 
                        appointment of Ingvar Varhaug as General Manager of NOC 
                        based in Norway, and Keith Laddiman as Business 
                        Development Manager for the offshore oil &amp; gas sector 
                        internationally, based in UK.<br>
                        <br>
                        A high level delegation from Renaissance had visited 
                        Norway recently for meetings with NOC employees and 
                        union representatives, and NOC clients before concluding 
                        and signing the deal with MCN. Ever since MCN decided to 
                        divest NOC as a non-core activity, there had been 
                        considerable interest and competition for the 
                        acquisition amongst major international contract 
                        caterers. Renaissance’s Commercial General Manager for 
                        Contract Services, Ananda Fernando, explained, “Maersk 
                        has taken great care to select a buyer which understands 
                        and satisfies the highest safety, quality and customer 
                        service standards expected in the offshore oil &amp; gas 
                        industry in the North Sea.” He added, “The commercial 
                        details of the deal are subject to a confidentiality 
                        requirement. However, the scale of the acquisition can 
                        be understood by considering the current annual revenue 
                        of NOC at over RO5 million.”<br>

                        transportation activity which includes passengers, 
                        flights, cargo and post services, according to HE

                        Aviation Affairs at the Ministry of Transport and 
                        Communications. The average growth of passengers reached 
                        28 per cent during the first half of this year, as the 
                        number of passengers reached 2.30 million approx. 
                        compared to 1.80 million approx. during the same period 
                        last year. The number of departing flights increased by 
                        15 per cent during June 2006 to reach 1,940 flights, 
                        compared with 1,691 flights during the same month in 
                        2005. He attributed this significant growth in air 
                        transportation at the Seeb International Airport to the 
                        growth in Gulf Air flights, which were transferred from 
                        Abu Dhabi to Muscat. They grew by 46 per cent in June — 
                        from 521 flights in June last year to 761 flights last 
                        June. He also said some airlines, such as Oman Air, 
                        increased their flights since the beginning of this year 
                        to reach 450 last May, compared with 321 flights in the

                        2006-2007 for the 11th consecutive year. Unveiled by H.E. 
                        Ahmed Abdul Nabi Macki, Minister of National Economy, 
                        the latest edition of Progress acknowledges and applauds 
                        the futuristic vision of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin

                        understanding of the way our nation has developed over 
                        the years. This book is a well-analyzed volume with rich 
                        content, capturing the progress of each of the eight 
                        regions of Oman”, said H.E. Ahmed Abdul Nabi Macki. He 
                        further commended UMS for the zeal and dedication that 
                        went into preparing and publishing Progress (Al Takkadum) 
                        2006-2007 and congratulated the entire team for their 
                        achievement.<br>
                        <br>
                        “On this Renaissance Day, we celebrate the developments 
                        that have flowed from His Majesty’s wise policies and 
                        that have transformed Oman into a modern and vibrant 
                        country. We rejoice in dedicating Progress (Al Takkadum) 
                        2006-2007 to showcase these developments”, said Sandeep 
                        Sehgal, General Manager of UMS. This year’s edition 
                        highlights the remarkable socio-economic and 
                        geo-political achievements that have transformed the 
                        Sultanate into a forward looking progressive nation. It 
                        takes a look at the vivid and tremendous metamorphosis 
                        at the grassroots level -strategically devised by the 
                        pragmatic vision of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. 
                        The carefully put together publication goes beyond 
                        Muscat to capture and reflect the growth of the 
                        Sultanate at the regional level, examining on a 
                        macro-level, the positive changes that have taken place 
                        across the length and breadth of the Sultanate since 
                        1970.<br>
                        <br>
                        “It has always been a matter of pride and honour for us 
                        to bring out this publication in the best manner 
                        possible and value-adding to the presentation each 
                        year,” expressed Alpana Roy, Assistant General Manager, 
                        UMS. Thematically, this annual volume highlights the 
                        eight regions’ composite pace of progress in the spheres 
                        of education, health, social welfare, sports and 
                        culture, electricity and water, telecommunication and 
                        housing. It also mirrors the way the economy has grown 
                        in leaps and bounds as seen in the sectors of oil and 
                        gas, trade, agriculture and fishery and more recently 
                        tourism. Meticulously researched articles on social and 
                        economic developments, evocative reviews, and a 
                        spotlight on each region’s key feature — and its 
                        prospects bring to light the past, present and future of 
                        each of the Sultanates eight regions. It is a snapshot 
                        account of each of the eight regions’ development which 
                        ultimately empowers the people — the most important 
                        resource wealth of a nation.</font></p>

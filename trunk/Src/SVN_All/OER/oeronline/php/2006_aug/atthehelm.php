            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">landed in this beautiful country, the Sultanate of Oman, in the 
            year 1975 as a fresh graduate. I started my career with Unilevers. I 
            had a very brief rendezvous with office supplies before the 
            Unilevers break. I joined Muscat Electronics in 1979, taking care of 
            practically everything, including sales. In fact, that was the year 
            Muscat Electronics was established and I have been with ME since its 
            inception. <br>
            <br>
            We had our first Sony showroom in Muttrah. Soon we had more brands 
            coming in like Tanita, Fairmate, Silver and Crown, Casio, etc. We 
            brought in many other brands into our company’s portfolio — Supra, 
            Ricoh and air-conditioning division–Daikin. Thereafter, I started 
            diverting my attention towards development of these agencies. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Witness to Development<br>
            </b><br>
            I have fantabulous memories of my 30-year experience in Oman. I have 
            travelled to most of the interior locations of the country. Oman is 
            really very beautiful. I started travelling to the interiors in the 
            70s and continued in the 80s and the 90s. I have seen development 
            take place at practically all the places in the Sultanate. <br>
            <br>
            When I came to Oman in 1975, the area that houses Ruwi Market now, 
            had just a few shops. The pace of development has been tremendous. I 
            have seen virtually each and every building in Oman coming up. Even 
            when I travel to the interiors I can remember what was there before 
            and what are the changes that have come up. <br>
            <br>
            For instance, I first travelled to Ibri 20 years ago. Today, when I 
            go the place, I am amazed by the changes. In the capital area of 
            Muscat, 1985 can be termed a watershed year as the pace of 
            development really accelerated since then. <br>
            <br>
            I surf the scene with relentless energy, translating trends to help 
            businesses identify emerging opportunities. My area of expertise is 
            analysing trends to help organizations anticipate change. My 
            experience includes working on strategy and innovation projects.<br>
            <br>
            There have been a lot of changes in the patterns of selling. 
            Earlier, it used to be dealer-oriented. After that it was 
            showroom-oriented. Now, it is power retailer-oriented. <br>

            Growth Chart <br>
            </b><br>
            Bringing over 30 years of marketing and brand leveraging experience 
            in Muscat Electronics, I direct consumer analysis and project 
            management for Iconoculture, which leads a team of cultural 
            reporters, based across the country, observing, analysing, and 
            applying current and emerging trends and their underlying consumer 
            values.<br>
            <br>
            Since I took over as the GM of Muscat Electronics (ME) in 1999, 
            there have been tremendous changes in our group company. For 
            example, in terms of volume business, we have grown tremendously. We 
            established a number of service franchises in the Sultanate. But the 
            thrust area has been manpower. We now have more professional people 
            working with us and bringing about a real difference. Our people are 
            our strength. <br>
            <b><br>
            Motivation Theory <br>
            <br>
            </b>Accompanying any societal revolution is a fundamental change in 
            the structure of the family that reflects the market’s new dynamics. 
            Like the industrial age, the digital age is ushering in a profound 
            change in society that will affect everything, from marketing and 
            media to language and socially acceptable norms.<br>
            <br>
            We have lot of schemes and motivational programmes for our 
            employees. Internally, we have regular management and staff 
            meetings. The idea is to motivate team at all levels. Besides, I too 
            organise regular meetings with my staff and their suggestions are 
            always welcome.<br>
            <br>
            Our air-conditioning division has developed drastically and is 
            enjoying leadership in its sector. There’s obviously no better way 
            than breeding innovation from within. Changing trends hold the key 
            to innovation, even in the presumably staid categories. <br>
            <br>
            As for the management gurus, I take a little bit from every one of 
            them, whether it’s Tom Peters or Ron Kaufman. But there is no one 
            single guru that I subscribe to, or follow. I prefer a holistic 
            approach. Some of the ideas that I have implemented so far have 
            indeed been sourced from Late M. R. Chhabria, Chairman, Jumbo 
            Electronics, Dubai, and also from these management gurus. But we 
            have to incorporate the ideas in our own idiosyncratic way when it 
            comes to operations. I would like to make ME one of the best 
            companies in Oman. We are in the field of electronics- home 
            appliances, air-conditioning and office automation. I would like to 
            see it as a total solutions provider whether it’s home, office or 
            entertainment. <br>
            <br>

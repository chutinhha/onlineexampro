<img border="0" src="peri2.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">Visa, the biggest credit card company, is seeking to raise as much as $10 
billion in what may be the largest initial public offering this year. The 
company, based in San Francisco, has filed an application with the US Securities 
and Exchange Commission for the IPO. The Visa float comes after investors have 
bid up shares of MasterCard, the second-biggest credit card company, almost 400 
per cent since its initial public offering in May 2006. “They’re piggybacking 
off the public market success that MasterCard has enjoyed,” said Douglas Ciocca 
at Renaissance Financial.<br>
<br>
Visa announced in October that it would combine most of its global businesses 
into one unit. Visa combined its businesses, excluding Europe, to save money, 
facilitate the share sale, streamline decision-making and make acquisitions 
easier, the company said in its filing. Net income for the combined company was 
$770.9 million for the nine months ended June 30. Visa had revenues of $3.73 
billion for the nine months ended June 30, compared with $3.91 billion for 
fiscal 2006, the filing shows.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" width="90%" size="1">

</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Malaysia’s national automaker Proton has backed Iran’s idea to produce what they 
want to call ‘Islamic cars’ for the global market. The proposal, initiated by 
Iran, seeks to manufacture cars equipped with all Islamic facilities and driven 
by Muslim drivers. <br>
<br>
Proton’s Managing Director Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir said that his 
firm would team up with Iranian and Turkish companies, since the three are 
leading Islamic countries in the auto-manufacturing field. “We have taken the 
approval of the Malaysian government in this respect and the country’s officials 
can confer with the Iranian government on manufacturing the Islamic cars,” he 
suggested <br>

Union</font></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Enterprise IG, the global brand agency–which created the identities for American 
Express and Bank of America, implemented product branding and brand environments 
for Mars Inc., Unilever, Motorola and COFCO, among others, and helped grow and 
position corporate giants like Credit Suisse, Corus, KPMG and Vodafone–has been 
renamed as The Brand Union.<br>
<br>
In a move that seeks to fully align a business that comprises 21 offices 
globally, the name change and new identity are just the first steps in a full 
relaunch programme, masterminded by Simon Bolton, Worldwide CEO of The Brand 
Union, who moved to the group from advertising network JWT in 2006. The 
revitalised agency will enhance WPP’s drive in the global brand arena. This 
change comes at a time when the agency has won major new briefs from Tesco, 
Deutsche Post, Samsung, Emaar Corporate, Schroders and GE Money. <br>

company</font><br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<img border="0" src="peri4.jpg" width="204" height="136" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">PetroChina is now the world’s largest 
company by market capitalisation, valued at approximately $1 trillion. The 
Chinese behemoth easily eclipsed its nearest rival, US-based Exxon Mobile, which 
is valued at around $488 billion. One trillion can be hard to wrap your mind 
around.<br>
<br>
It means that Chinese stock market investors were putting a higher valuation on 
PetroChina than that on Exxon Mobile, Chevron Texaco, British Petroleum and 
Total SA combined. What makes PetroChina’s valuation even more incredible is 
that its revenue for the first half of this year was less than a third of 
Exxon’s and its net profit was only $12 billion compared to Exxon’s $20 billion. 
Energy companies are not the only Chinese companies to be prospering. According 
to Bloomberg, while American banks are being punished by investors, China has 
become home to the world’s three largest banks by market valuation. Although 
market values placed on Chinese companies are largely a product of a euphoric 
stock market, the high valuations compared to US corporations are also symbolic 
of a broader trend. America is no longer the world’s sole unchallenged economic 
superpower.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

        <b>Anil Wadhwa, the new Indian Ambassador to Oman, says there is a lot

        relationship</b></font></p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="dip.jpg" width="400" height="272"></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">It is strange, but true. May be, purely coincidental. The man who played 
        a vital role in shaping up the multilateral body set up at the global 
        level to prohibit chemical weapons almost a decade ago is straddling the 
        most peaceful Gulf state –the Sultanate of Oman – as the Indian envoy. 
        We are talking about Anil Wadhwa, the new Indian Ambassador. What is 
        equally intriguing and interesting is the fact that his spouse too is a 
        career diplomat, serving the home country’s ‘interests’ across the 
        globe. Together, sometimes. Far away, some times. That’s life and that, 
        in brief, is the history of the Wadhwa couple.<br>
        <br>
        The salt-and-pepper haired Wadhwa – a multi-linguist to the core – is a 
        disarmament protagonist. Despite his multiple stints in the Dragon land, 
        the People’s Republic of China, Anil was lucky enough to observe and 
        absorb the reform process that his host country was experiencing in the 
        1980s. For a fresh Indian Foreign Service official, it was a dream 
        start. Perhaps it was his Chinese posting that helped him understand the 
        troubled transition his home country went through a decade later. 
        Military might was not enough.<br>
        <br>
        “The world has changed. Political clout based on military strength does 
        not get a purchase these days,” declares Anil, seated at the India 
        House, his current habitat on the shores of Qurrum beach, on an early 
        November afternoon. Prove your economic strength and you’re accepted in 
        the highest of high circles, grandiosely declares the soft-spoken 
        diplomat. More than military clout, economic might is a necessity, if 
        Anil is to be believed.<br>
        <br>
        Anil has a valid point. If you notice that is the reason many developing 
        countries like India and Brazil have begun to have a major say in world 
        affairs. Anil asks rhetorically: “Can you believe that the G-8 now 
        consult countries like India on a slew of issues: environment, trade 
        talks, debt and poverty reduction, HIV AIDS, etc.?” Adding after a short 
        pause: “Developing countries play and contribute a lot at multilateral 
        institutions,” driving home his considered view that the old style of 
        diplomacy has no relevance in the globalisation-driven scenario. “No 
        single superpower can call shots and dominate… Understand that even 
        superpowers have constraints.”<br>
        <br>
        <b>Diplomatic Career</b><br>
        Diplomacy, according to him, is popular all over the world. Why? 
        “Perhaps. It is one profession where people can combine career and ‘see’ 
        the world!” Wadhwa is not exaggerating. In his own career, spanning 
        two-and-a-half decades, he has seen HongKong, China, the Netherlands, 
        Switzerland and, of course, his homeland. There’s something more to the 
        career he pursues with a child-like curiosity. “You learn a lot as you 
        grow. No single day is the same. You’re challenged mentally daily. One 
        day, you dabble in multilateral issues. The other day, a bilateral 
        issue,” explains Wadhwa, his enthusiasm evident.<br>
        <br>
        Does the career lead to a Jekyll and Hyde syndrome? That is, do 
        diplomats lead two different lives: one, a public face – sporting the 
        most charming and best behaviour–and the other personal–something 
        totally different? Wadhwa assesses the import of the query with a 
        nonchalance befitting a career diplomat. Clearing his throat, he gets to 
        the core: “The station in life demands a particular set of behaviour. 
        Believe me, a diplomat can ill-afford to conduct oneself as an ordinary 
        national from the home country. It is a huge responsibility.”<br>
        <br>
        What about the ‘stiff upper lip’ tag? “You’re wrong,” interjects Deepa 
        Gopalan Wadhwa, India’s Ambassador to Sweden, currently on a short 
        vacation to help her spouse set home in a new country. “Diplomats are 
        not stiff upper-lipped. We are like anybody else. At formal and official 
        interactions, we may appear a bit reserved. But if we know people 
        personally, we are different.”<br>
        <br>
        Adds Wadhwa: “If you are garrulous, you can’t speak your mind. On the 
        contrary, you are supposed to keep quiet. Similarly, as a diplomat, I 
        cannot have a favourite or prejudice. It does not mean I lose my 
        original and real personality due to career constraints. We adapt to a 
        situation. Some diplomats find it difficult. But a good envoy adapts 
        easily.” Chips in Deepa, “We have loosened up a lot these days. There 
        are more public fora to disseminate information. Everything is out for 
        everyone to see. The rules of the game have changed. It is a prejudiced 
        view to say that diplomats enjoy maintaining a stiff upper lip.”<br>
        <br>
        Wadhwa’s pet theme, expectedly, is disarmament. Reminiscing his Geneva 
        days, he says, “There was a global consensus achieved in 1978 to do away 
        with nuclear weapons. Somehow issues got diluted over the years with the 
        focus shifting to weapons of mass destruction and even conventional arms 
        race.” How does he perceive today’s world? “Dangerous place, it is,” 
        comes a quick response. But he hastens to add that the porous borders 
        combined with elements of terrorism and loose nukes are making the task 
        of assessing the current scenario unpredictable. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Oman Agenda</b><br>
        On an average, Wadhwa has spent roughly three-and-half years at every 
        posting. So, what’s up for the next three-and-a-half years in Oman? “In 
        the first 100 days, I will be working towards greater coordination and 
        cooperation between Indian and Omani private sector. There is a lot of 
        synergy between the two countries and I will try to reinforce this 
        relationship. I will try to take the special purpose vehicle route 
        (investment fund route) to promote two-way trade and investment. He is 
        gung-ho, given the economic buoyancy of the Sultanate. He harps on the 
        successful drive to move away from oil-dependency and the huge 
        infrastructure developmental activities that are reverberating 
        throughout the length and breadth of Oman. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Homely Truths</b><br>
        And on a personal note, he is thankful to His Masters back home, the 
        Government of India. The authorities have been very ‘considerate’ in 
        ensuring the Wadhwa couple do stay in unison most of the time. They have 
        worked in the same country and the same embassy on a number of times. Or 
        occasionally worked in neighbouring countries. Thus, while Anil was in 
        Geneva and The Hague, Deepa was in Stockholm! ‘We never missed each 
        other,” butts in Deepa, a chemistry major.<br>
        <br>
        Given the fact that they belong to the same cadre and nurse the same 
        ambition, viz., to promote their home country abroad, they do exchange 
        notes on a variety of issues. They use other as ‘sounding boards’. That 
        their home country has benefited immensely from this ‘power’ couple is 
        no exaggeration. <br>
        <br>
        How long the Chopin-loving and tennis-playing Anil has to wait for Deepa 
        to join and ‘explore’ the beautiful country called Oman is just a 
        question of time. After all, the benevolent couple have benevolent 
        masters back home. Till then, the history major has a long laundry list 
        to attend to in his new posting. Good luck, Sir!<br>

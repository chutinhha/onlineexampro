</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>As 2007 draws to a close, Dr Jasim 
Husain Ali reviews Bahrain’s economic performance in the year gone by<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="closeup.jpg" width="137" height="255" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The year 2007 proved to be full of events for Bahrain’s economy. Undoubtedly, 
there were pluses and minuses. The year witnessed commitment by the highest 
authority that absence of taxation would remain a key economic policy. Still, in 
the same year, Bahrain scored mixed results in international reports, notably 
with regard to other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).<br>
<br>
<b>No taxation <br>
</b>On October 17, Bahrain’s King Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa spelled out key 
characteristics of the national economy for the years to come. In a speech 
inaugurating the second term of the 2006-2010 National Assembly, King Hamad 
ruled out imposition of taxes on corporate income. Instead, he urged people to 
work hard in order to “attract more local and foreign investments and boost 
professional aptitudes and productive levels, so that Bahrain can consolidate 
its status as one of the most preferred investment destinations.”<br>
<br>
Ostensibly, the King was responding to demands by some members of parliament 
calling on the authorities to seriously consider applying taxes on firms 
generating their revenues from the local economy, such as retail banks. As part 
of their arguments, these MPs together with other economic commentators argued 
that Bahrain should broaden its revenue base. Currently, the oil and gas sector 
accounts for about three-quarters of the country’s treasury income.<br>
<br>
<b>Welcome FDI</b><br>
To be sure, the government considers lack of taxation as a primary competitive 
edge and as a means for attracting investments. Officials were thrilled to note 
the increasing global appreciation of the Kingdom’s economic prospects. The 
World Investment Report 2007, issued by the World Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD), has depicted a rather rosy picture of Bahrain when it 
comes to foreign direct investments (FDI).<br>
<br>
Bahrain attracted US$2.9-billion FDI in 2006, registering a staggering yearly 
growth of 177 per cent. Within the GCC, only Saudi Arabia and the UAE managed to 
attract more FDI than Bahrain. The Kingdom occupied the 11th place amongst 141 
countries on the Inward FDI Performance Index in 2006, thus advancing 12 
positions (the best result for any GCC state). The enhancement was made possible 
through steady economic reforms that saw foreign firms gaining control of power 
plants and more recently port management.<br>
<br>
<b>Freest regional economy<br>
</b>The 2007 Index of Economic Freedom considers Bahrain to be the freest within 
the GCC and ranked it 39th worldwide. The report, jointly published by the 
Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, ranked Oman as the second 
freest economy within the GCC and 54th globally. The index uses the results of 
ten variables to rank the countries and these include business freedom, trade 
freedom, fiscal freedom, freedom from government, monetary freedom, investment 
freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labour 
freedom.<br>
<br>
The 2007 report considered Bahrain’s economy 68.4 per cent free, with the best 
result granted to fiscal freedom thanks to the absence of taxes on personal and 
corporate income. Also, Bahrain scored well in the financial freedom variable, 
as the country is home to the largest concentration of foreign banks in the 
region. Conversely, the worst performance was recorded for labour freedom. The 
report was not pleased with the Kingdom’s inflexible employment market, as 
authorities urge firms to hire nationals.<br>
<br>
<b>E-government capability </b><br>
Still, a report by the Center for Public Policy at Brown University in the US 
considers Bahrain the most capable GCC government in e-governance. The Global 
E-Government 2007 ranked Bahrain at number 15 worldwide. Qatar, the second best 
within the GCC, occupied 42nd position globally.<br>
<br>
The study analysed a total of 1,687 websites in 198 nations. The study looked 
into the executive (prime minister), legislative (parliament) and judicial 
(courts) portals as well as websites related to economic development, business 
regulation, military, transportation, taxation, tourism and foreign affairs.<br>
<br>
The index is based on features related to three main variables, namely online 
information, service delivery and public access. Features looked into include 
online publications and databases, video and audio clips, privacy and security, 
disability access and user fees. Bahrain collected 40.3 points out of 100.<br>
<br>
<b>Not very competitive</b><br>
Against this, Bahrain performed poorly in the Global Competitiveness Report for 
2007-2008, published by the World Economic Forum. The latest report covered 131 
countries and economies, which together account for 98 per cent of the world’s 
gross domestic product (GDP).<br>
<br>
Countries included in the study are ranked on the basis of their performance on 
the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The index is based on three broad 
categories of basic requirements, efficiency enhancers and innovation and 
sophistication factors.<br>
<br>
Here, the basic requirements category is subdivided into four pillars, namely 
institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic stability, health and primary 
education. The efficiency enhancers’ category comprises six pillars of higher 
education and training, goods and market efficiency, labour market efficiency, 
financial market sophistication, technological readiness and market size. 
Similarly, the innovation and sophistication factors category are made up of 
business sophistication and innovation.<br>
<br>
The report ranked Bahrain as the least competitive economy within the GCC by 
being ranked at number 43 globally having earned 4.42 points on the 7-point 
scale. Bahrain’s key weakness was its market size, ranked number 109 worldwide 
in the report. With a GDP of around UDS$15 billion, Bahrain’s economy was the 
smallest in the GCC. But it’s said Bahrain’s major strength lies in financial 
market sophistication, number 12 worldwide. Bahrain serves as a primary 
financial services market in the region. The report ranked Kuwait as the 
region’s most competitive economy, putting it at number 30 worldwide.<br>
<br>
<b>Transparency problem<br>
</b>Likewise, Bahrain lost ground in the 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index 
(CPI), published annually by the Germany-based Transparency International. The 
CPI is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher numbers indicating less 
corruption.<br>
<br>
The index is compiled on the basis of several surveys and polls. Reviewed 
economies earn points based on perceptions expressed by business and academic 
professionals concerning ways of doing business in various countries. The 
respondents, who include local and expatriate residents, provide views about 
possible corruptive practices involving public officials with regard to winning 
business preferences, such as contracts. The study relies on numerous studies 
conducted by internationally renowned establishments. These include the World 
Bank, Economist Intelligence Unit, Freedom House, World Economic Forum, Asian 
Development Bank and African Development Bank, to name a few. As such, the 2007 
report was supported by findings of 14 surveys and expert assessments.<br>
<br>
A minimum of three studies is required for a nation to be included in the 
report, and Bahrain allowed for five studies. Unfortunately, Bahrain plunged 10 
positions to 46 after scoring 5 points, down some 0.7 points. Qatar topped the 
GCC list, scoring 6 on the 10-point scale, thereby enabling it to clinch spot 
number 32 worldwide. <br>
<br>
In totality, Bahrain authorities need to reflect on achievements and setbacks of 
2007.</font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

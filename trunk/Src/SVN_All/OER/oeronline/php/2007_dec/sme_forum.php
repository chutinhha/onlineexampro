</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>HSBC is aggressively pursuing the 
under served small and medium enterprise (SME) sector in Oman with its newly 
formed Business Banking Unit (BBU), says Qamar Saleem, Senior Manager-BBU, HSBC 
Bank Middle East Limited, in a talk with OER. Excerpts:<br>
</b><br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="sme.jpg" width="250" height="326" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">How do you define SME in Omani context?<br>
</b>Definitions of what constitutes a small and medium enterprise vary 
considerably in Oman’s financial sector. We have used a customer segmentation 
model to develop our SME services and proposition in Oman. There are two 
distinct business segments within our Business Banking Unit. “Business Finance 
Solutions” segment caters to our customers’ borrowing needs with credit 
facilities up to RO500,000. “Direct Financial Services” segment caters to 
transaction banking needs of our non-borrowing customer base. Customers outside 
the above SME definition scope are handled by other units within our corporate 
banking department.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the size of SME sector in Oman?<br>
</b>In the absence of published data, we conducted our own in-house assessment 
which suggested that there are only in fact 15,000-20,000 of SMEs in Oman 
generating 10-20 per cent of employment.<br>
<br>
In Oman, SMEs finance comprises only 2-5 per cent of the portfolios of local 
banks. Estimates from the World Bank indicate that SMEs have contributed over 55 
per cent of GDP in OECD countries and between 60-70 per cent of GDP in 
middle-income and low-income countries generating 60-70 per cent of employment. 
Thus there is a significant potential for the SME segment in Oman to grow in 
terms of contribution to GDP and creation of employment.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the importance of SME segment in HSBC’s overall business strategy in 
Oman?<br>
</b>At HSBC, we aspire to be the best SME bank not only in Oman but across the 
82 countries where we operate. Our solutions for SMEs have evolved from our 
experience of handling 2 million SME businesses across the globe. We aim to 
deliver seamless services to SMEs and to partner with key stakeholders to 
further stimulate the SME sector. In France, we partnered with UBIFRANCE to help 
firms develop their business in foreign markets. We have also entered an 
agreement with Austrade Australia to assist Australian businesses in their 
international growth. We signed a cooperation agreement in Brazil with SEBRAE, a 
government agency, to further support SME businesses. In Oman we would also work 
with key stake holders to help develop the SME sector.<br>
<br>
Next year, HSBC will be celebrating 60 years of operations in Oman. We have been 
serving the interests of SMEs all these decades and in order to move alongside 
the government’s vision for the SME segment we have launched our dedicated 
proposition with a renewed focus on this segment, earlier this year. I am 
pleased to say that Oman was the leading country in the region where HSBC set up 
its Business Banking Unit. Across the Middle East, we have now established 
successful Business Banking teams in Oman, Jordan, Qatar, Lebanon, Bahrain, 
Dubai and Abu Dhabi.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the most striking features of the SME market in Oman that caught 
your attention?<br>
</b>There are essentially three distinctive features. Firstly the SME sector in 
Oman is relatively young in terms of its life cycle as compared to other similar 
markets, through the potential for growth is tremendous. Secondly, in terms of 
access to finance, financial institutions in Oman are yet to match the varying 
needs of SME customers in terms of products and services. And lastly, use of 
electronic banking channels like Internet Banking is relatively lower in Oman.<br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="manage.jpg" width="300" height="220" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Talking of technology platforms, do you think SMEs are scared of e-banking 
due to security related issues?<br>
</b>Absolutely. In a market research conducted recently we found that the level 
of concern for using Internet Banking, with respect to security, was rated at 
3.7 (on a scale of 1-4). However I feel that the market needs to be educated in 
terms of internet usage and security as these are highly efficient banking 
channels, widely used across the world. The benefits to the SME businesses is 
also far reaching in terms of cost control, 24 hour access to information and 
ability to transact remotely.<br>
<br>
We at HSBC offer two technology-driven products namely Business Internet Banking 
and HSBCnet. To address the security concern of our clients we have a two-factor 
authentication process which includes both the traditional password based 
security (PIN number) and a Security Device or smart card, which represents a 
significant enhancement over the traditional processes. We also ensure that 
requisite training is conducted for usage of these products<br>
<br>
<b>What is the primary focus of your SME model?<br>
</b>The SME proposition in Oman is built around our understanding of three key 
needs of SMEs which are access to efficient banking services and channels; 
access to finance with quick turnaround time; and access to advisory and 
training services.<br>
<br>
<b>How many layers are there in HSBC in the complete credit sanction and 
disbursal process?<br>
</b>We have established a framework to provide quick turnaround to our clients. 
For credit upto RO50,000, we have adopted a credit scoring approach through our 
“Business Express Credit” service, which assesses the company’s business 
strength and relies less on the collateral being offered. Through Business 
Express Credit, customers can receive their offer within 24-hours after 
submitting their applications. Though credit scoring has been around in consumer 
markets in North America and Europe for more than two decades, it is relatively 
new to this region.<br>
<br>
For higher amounts of facilities, the credit approval process has been reduced 
to one or two steps depending on nature and size of the customer’s request. We 
have a dedicated team of experienced relationship managers and credit analysts 
to ensure a swift approval process<br>
<br>
<b>What are your major products and services for SMEs?<br>
</b>In order to provide our clients with efficient banking channels and services 
we have products like Business Select, Business ATM, Business Internet Banking, 
Telephone Banking and HSBCnet. Apart from this, we have a dedicated Business 
Banking website, a call center and a customer services unit. We do facilitate 
customer needs wherever we operate and our International Banking Center (IBC) in 
Oman has been recently set up to ensure that all of their requirements are met.<br>
<br>
To provide convenient access to finance, we offer a full array of lending and 
trade facilities for SMEs in Oman. Apart from traditional lending facilities 
like overdrafts, term loans &amp; asset finance, we have a strong base of trade 
products and services in the areas of import, export and guarantees. We also 
offer factoring services in Oman which combines sales-linked finance, bad debt 
protection, payment collection and transaction services that help SMEs to 
compete on equal trading terms.<br>
<br>
At HSBC, we have the advantage of our international network and product 
knowledge spanning over 82 countries and territories. We can call upon our 
experts to share best practice through our organised training services. Some of 
the recently organized events included trade and factoring seminars, UCP 600 
orientation sessions and presentations on theChanging Nature of the Dollar &amp; 
Gulf economic outlook 2008. We also recently sponsored an SME training event 
“Heartbeat Oman” in association with the Centre for Management Excellence and 
Oman Chamber of Commerce. I would like to highlight that HSBC is one of the most 
active banks in catering to the specific needs of the SME segment across the 
world and we aim to make use of our global experience and expertise in order to 
support the government’s initiatives in development of the SME <br>
sector in Oman. </font>

        <b>Khalid Hamed Al Kharousi, Branding and Marketing Communication 
        Manager for Oman Mobile Telecommunications LLC talks about his 
        profession and passion to OER<br>
        </b><br>
        <img border="0" src="lastpage.jpg" width="250" height="232" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">After finishing his secondary education from Muscat, Khalid Hamed Al 
        Kharousi enrolled himself in Sultan Qaboos University, majoring in 
        Physics and Computer Programming. He joined the Physics department as a 
        technician after graduation. Khalid was encouraged to promote research 
        initiated by the SQU. To hone his marketing skills, Khalid pursued a 
        course on marketing as well. “After three years, at the end of 2000, the 
        management asked me to move into the administration side and made me the 
        Director of Administration and Finance.” <br>
        <br>
        Khalid also brought out an in-house newsletter. Seeing the interest he 
        showed in bringing out the newsletter, the President of the University 
        gave him an additional offer of being a Director of PR and Information 
        for the whole university. Khalid accepted the challenge and took up the 
        job. Side by side he also did a PR and Media course to upgrade his 
        skills further.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Moving on </b><br>
        It was not long before Oman Mobile Telecommunications Company gave him 
        an offer of Branding &amp; Market Communication Manager. When he moved in, 
        the managing director asked Khalid to take care of his office as well, 
        along with the demanding marketing job. In 2004, he was handling two 
        positions: Office Manager of the Managing Director’s office and Branding 
        &amp; Market Communication Manager. It was only later that he was asked to 
        focus on marketing, given its strategic importance for the company.<br>
        <br>
        A voracious reader, Khalid reads whatever books he can lay his hands on. 
        The subjects may range from public relations and photography to 
        communications and marketing. The exposure gave him added impetus and 
        confidence in building up contacts. Today, around 17 people work under 
        him in three sections: Sales Promotion, PR and Event Management.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Exciting images</b><br>
        But, wait, there’s more to Khalid’s personality. He is a passionate 
        photographer. He bought his first camera in 1990 and six years later he 
        bought a professional camera. Khalid has travelled all parts of the 
        Sultanate and photographed breathtaking and panoramic images. He has 
        already scanned his entire collection of 18,000 images and archived it, 
        hoping that one day he will be able to hold an exhibition. Khalid is 
        fond of shooting landscapes. He has in fact brought out a calendar 
        titled: ‘Discovery of Oman’. His first calendar was released in 2000. 
        Khalid brought out calendars continuously till 2006 except for 2001. He 
        plans to bring out a calendar in 2008.<br>
        <br>
        While talking about Oman he says, “Oman is a beautiful place with 
        mountains and green vegetation. I have been to all governorates and have 
        shot a collection of images. In fact some of my photographs have won 
        laurels.” <br>
        <br>
        Trekking and mountaineering are his other hobbies. About his adventurous 
        pursuits Khalid says, “I love Africa. I have been on African Safaris 
        several times. Tanzania is the place I love to visit again and again, 
        especially Serengeti Safari. I have already been twice for that. First, 
        I went with my family and then camped there with my colleagues. My wife 
        and me tried to scale the Kilimanjaro cliff also but could only finish 
        the first half, as she was exhausted. We came down in three hours. That 
        was a great experience for both of us.”<br>

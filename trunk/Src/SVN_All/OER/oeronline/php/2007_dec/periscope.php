<b>The dollar peg makes a revaluation of the GCC currencies and a tightening of 
monetary policy impossible, writes Matein Khalid</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="peri.jpg" width="135" height="209" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">The GCC will not be immune from global economic, financial and monetary events 
in 2008. The biggest dilemma facing the region is the continued free fall in the 
US dollar, which has now fallen to a new low of 1.47 against the euro and to 
2.11 against the sterling even while crude oil prices flirt perilously close to 
US$100. The collapse of the dollar, which began in early 2002 with Greenspan’s 
epic rate cuts in the aftermath of 9/11 and the explosive economic growth of 
China, threatens the economies of the GCC in ominous ways.<br>
<br>
A depreciating dollar means the GCC countries import inflation because the 
existence of the currency peg in all the GCC states, apart from Kuwait, means 
the regional central banks have to follow the monetary policy diktat of the 
Federal Reserve even while the business cycles of the GCC diverge from the US, 
as they do now. The US economy is burdened with the fallout from the subprime 
meltdown and the credit crunch on Wall Street. This means the Bernanke Fed has 
been forced to cut interest rates to give lender of the last resort credence to 
US banks at a time when the interbank deposit and commercial paper markets shows 
ominous signs of systemic distress. The Fed has to slash interest rates even if 
it means a collapse in the dollar, a phenomenon that began with the September 
FOMC rate cut. But the GCC central banks need to tighten monetary policies to 
combat inflation rates, which have reached double digits in the UAE and Qatar 
and hit two decade highs in Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia because of 
the liquidity tsunami in the banking system, food and cement price rises, 
property speculation, the threefold increase in rents and the most dramatic 
surge in money supply witnessed in the GCC for a generation. The dollar peg 
makes a revaluation of the GCC currencies and a tightening of monetary policy 
impossible.<br>
<br>
<b>Lower purchasing power</b><br>
GCC central bank and sovereign wealth fund reserves are also invested primarily 
in dollars. The GCC states have been major and consistent creditors to the 
Euromarkets ever since the first petrodollar revolution in the 1970s. Abu 
Dhabi’s ADIA has invested an estimated US$800 billion and Kuwait US$250 billion 
in the global financial markets, with new sovereign wealth funds from Dubai and 
Qatar active in international mergers and acquisition deal making. A protracted 
bear market in the US dollar exposes the GCC to greenback devaluation risks and 
lowers the purchasing power of its offshore sovereign wealth – exactly the 
dilemma voiced by a top Chinese politician when he said that China should 
accumulate its reserves in euros, not dollars. It is a sad fact of international 
finance that the world’s reserve currency has been a disaster as a hard 
currency, having lost more than a third of its value against the euro, sterling, 
the Swiss franc and even Asian currencies as the Singapore dollar, Indian Rupee 
and South Korean won.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="peri1.jpg" width="350" height="233" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The other ominous global event I foresee in 2008 is the debacle in the global 
credit markets. Thanks to the revolution in derivatives and securitisation, Wall 
Street’s subprime woes cast their long shadow on the banking systems and 
financial markets of the GCC. One, as liquidity built up in bank balance sheets 
in 2006, some of the leading banks in the GCC invested billions of dollars in 
ostensible AAA rated collateralised mortgages. This means banks will have to 
write off such investments, as their global peers such as Citigroup, Merrill 
Lynch and Morgan Stanley have done. Two, losses in the subprime markets, the 
depositor run on Northern Rock, the gutting of money centre bank valuations on 
Wall Street and London, the failure of two German banks, several US hedge funds 
and mortgage lenders has injected a fear premium in the international capital 
markets. There is no way Middle East borrowers can borrow in the Eurobond market 
at razor thin spreads because the credit risk has suddenly spiked higher. 
Qatar’s Delta Two was forced to abandon its bid for British retailer Sainsbury 
because it simply could not borrow money with its syndicate banks at terms 
agreed before the subprime meltdown hit Wall Street in July. When bankers 
renegotiated the loan covenants, Delta Two could no longer pay the aggressive 
premium for Sainsbury. While GCC borrowers must pay higher interest costs in the 
offshore capital markets, lower rated borrowers may well be denied access to 
credit in the wholesale banking market. This will particularly hit retail banks 
in the region, who financed their high growth assets by borrowing in the Euro 
Medium Term Note (EMTN) market, a strategy whose risk potential was highlighted 
by the depositor run on Northern Rock, the first run on a UK bank since the 
Victorian age.<br>
<br>
<b>Surge in risk appetites</b><br>
Yet, it is now clear that the crisis has escalated beyond US subprime mortgages 
into a global credit crunch. In the past, central banks created high-powered 
money to rescue financial markets and boost economic growth. This is no longer 
possible in the age of securitisation because hedge funds, offshore investors 
and off balance-sheet funds hold untold billions of distressed CDO and credit 
derivatives and yet have no access to the Fed or the ECB’s discount window. So, 
the credit shock will mean a surge in risk appetites, a dramatic fall in 
leverage, at least an 8-10 per cent contraction in credit. The endgame will be a 
surge in credit risk spreads for borrowers and a plunge in capital flows to the 
emerging markets. This is the reason I believe a replay of the 1997 Asian 
financial crisis could well happen next year, particularly since Asian, GCC and 
Latin American emerging markets now trade at bubble valuations. As international 
banks scramble to raise capital to Basel Two protocols, they will tighten 
lending standards and slash international credit lines. After all, when the 
world’s biggest bank (Citi), a US$2.4 trillion monster, loses 30 per cent of its 
share value in a single quarter, the shock waves from its distress are bound to 
reverberate across the international banking system. The SP Financial Index has 
now revisited its August lows. The ABX Index, the cost of insuring against 
default on subprime mortgages, suggests that there is no immediate light at the 
end of the credit crunch tunnel. All this means that a recession in the US 
economy, the first since the Silicon Valley crash of 2000, is now inevitable. A 
fall in foreign trade will follow a US recession as there is nowhere the Asian 
emerging markets can hide when the US economic supertanker begins to sink. This 
means a plunge in crude oil, emerging market indices and global property could 
well happen in 2008.<br>
<br>
Three regional trends will define the GCC markets in 2008. One, the rise of 
institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, mutual 
funds and hedge funds will replace the retail speculative investor as the GCC’s 
value setter in the capital markets. Two, GCC stock exchanges will deregulate 
and integrate with the global capital markets. This will increase the 
correlation of GCC markets like UAE and Qatar, favoured by global emerging 
markets fund managers to Western Indices. The US$4-billion D P World IPO, the 
emergence of new GCC international investment banks like Kuwait’s Global, KFH, 
Bahrain’s Seico and UAE’s Shuaa will only accelerate the process. Three, 
recession in the US will mean a global shakeout in the investment banking 
capacity. This will mean that the DIFC, King Abdullah Economic City and Bahrain 
Financial Harbour will need to broaden their appeal to Indian, SE Asian, Chinese 
and Russian financial institutions and not rely on the wounded banking goliaths 
of Wall Street, the City of London, and Zurich’s Bahnofstrasse. When hard times 
hit the global markets, the GCC financial strategists should strive to convert 
risk into opportunity.</font></p>

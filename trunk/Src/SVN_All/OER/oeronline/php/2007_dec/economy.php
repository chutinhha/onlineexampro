<b>Oman Air is rising to the occasion as the Sultanate emerges as the most 
favoured tourist destination in the region</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="economy.jpg" width="143" height="398" align="right" hspace="6">While many airlines in the region have aggressive plans for expansion and are 
developing their home airports as global transport hubs, Oman Air’s strategy has 
been rather more measured.<br>
<br>
Qatar Airways, for example, has an aggressive expansion strategy and hopes to 
rival Dubai-based giant Emirates, carrying many transit passengers. Oman Air, 
however, is focusing on serving the increasing numbers of businesspeople and 
tourists coming to Oman as an end destination.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the recent flurry of publicity at the Dubai Air Show, where several 
Gulf airlines committed to radical fleet expansions, Oman Air gained little 
coverage. The airline signed deals to acquire a handful of aeroplanes, focussing 
instead on cost-effectiveness and flexibility.<br>
<br>
<b>Destinations</b><br>
The airline’s choice of new routes is indicative of a careful long-term approach 
to expansion. It opened its first two long-haul destinations in November, 
selecting Bangkok and London, cities from which there is already a fair number 
of people flying to Oman. It is also seeking to develop some destinations partly 
through code-share deals with Gulf Air, following the Omani government’s 
withdrawal from that airline earlier this year, leaving it entirely in the hands 
of Bahrain.<br>
<br>
Oman Air already has a large range of destinations in South Asia, reflecting the 
large number of people from the region who work in Oman. It also connects major 
cities across the Middle East to Muscat’s Seeb International Airport. In May, 
Oman Air agreed with Gulf Air that the Sultanate’s airline would develop routes 
in South Asia, while some destinations in Europe would be served by Gulf Air 
flights on a code-share basis.<br>
<br>
On November 28, Oman Air started flights to the Thai capital, Bangkok, which 
will run five times a week. Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport will be Oman Air’s 
first destination in South East Asia and is expected to be a base for further 
expansion. Officials say that the route is targeted at businesspeople from both 
countries, as well as tourists from South East Asia. The airline has leased two 
Airbus A310s to run the route.<br>
<br>
On November 26, the carrier started flights to London’s Gatwick Airport, which 
had previously only been a code-share destination. Oman has good relations and 
strong historic ties with the UK, so London was a natural starting point for 
Oman Air’s entry in Europe.<br>
<br>
However, the choice of Gatwick, located to the south of London, may be 
questionable. The airport is more commonly used for charter flights and a small 
handful of budget airlines, with most major carriers preferring Heathrow, which 
is only connected to Gatwick by a notoriously congested motorway and complicated 
public transport network. It may not seem the ideal place to attract travellers 
from other destinations in Europe and North America. Also, British Airways, 
currently the only carrier flying direct to London from Muscat, and one of the 
few airlines connecting the Sultanate directly to Europe, flies from Heathrow.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, it seems certain that there will be more than enough traffic to 
sustain the link. There are increasing numbers of tourists visiting the 
Sultanate from the UK. Recent reports in the British press suggest that Oman is 
developing a reputation as a top-end cultural and natural tourist destination. 
It is said that Oman’s living folk traditions, historic architecture and 
stunning, varied scenery set it a notch above other Gulf states, and as locales 
such as Dubai become popular, Oman is being pegged as a more exclusive 
destination by the status-sensitive British media. Currently, around 100,000 
British tourists visit Oman annually, with their numbers increasing every year.<br>
<br>
<b>Seeb Airport</b><br>
Oman Air’s development and the appeal of Sultanates as a destination are likely 
to get a boost when the expansion of Muscat’ Seeb International Airport is 
completed.<br>
<br>
Last year, 4.78 million passengers passed through the airport, up from 2.7 
million in 2000. Seeb is now being expanded to have a total capacity of 12 
million passengers a year by 2011, with a view to having a capacity of 48 
million by 2050. Better facilities and greater capacity offers both 
opportunities and challenges for the national carrier, as more airlines will be 
able to access Muscat, increasing the competition that it faces.<br>
<br>
This is even as the entry of more airlines will increase the visibility of the 
Sultanate and stimulate interest in it. If Oman Air can remain competitive, as 
it certainly seems set to do, it will surely benefit from any increased interest 
in the country. It will also be able to take advantage of the extra capacity and 
better facilities offered by the new terminal.<br>
Oman Air chief executive Ziad bin Karim Al Haremi has explicitly stated he has 
the intention to open “many more far-away destinations”. London and Bangkok are 
described as the first bases for Oman Air, so we should expect more destinations 
in Europe and South East Asia. Here, what is clear is the intention to expand, 
albeit gently.</font></p>

<br>
<b>Fleet expansion</b><br>
In keeping with its expansion plans and ensuring continued cost-effectiveness, 
Oman Air has undertaken to increase its fleet. Its choices reflect a 
characteristically cautious approach, aimed at serving more long-haul 
destinations in the long-term.<br>
<br>
At the Dubai Air Show, Oman Air ordered five new Airbus A330 aeroplanes 
specifically to develop its routes to Europe and the Far East. The airline 
announced that it had chosen the three A330-300s and two A330-200s for the 
efficiency and passenger comfort that they provide.<br>
<br>
Al Haremi said that the A330 fitted into the airline’s “long-term strategy to 
operate an efficient and reliable fleet with proven operating costs”, thereby 
hinting that the airline will compete on pricing with its rivals. Airbus claims 
that the A330 has the lowest operating costs in its class.<br>
<br>
It appears that Oman Air is playing a straight bat by purchasing what 
manufacturers refer to as “the industry standard in the 250 to 375 seat 
category”.<br>
<br>
The operating costs of the A330 are reduced by its high “commonality” – that is 
similarity in essentials to other Airbus aircraft. This reduces the amount of 
time needed to train pilots and crew for the new model, and a reduced number of 
unique parts needed by maintenance engineers.<br>
<br>
Oman Air has not gone down the path of Qatar Airways and Royal Jordanian in 
ordering its own Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which despite being a best seller, has 
been beset by delays and criticism of its construction.<br>
<br>
Other airlines have been snapping up brand-new models such as the hyperbolically 
named Dreamliner and the Airbus A380–the largest passenger airliner in history. 
However, Oman Air has eschewed novelty and opted for reliable workhorses; the 
A330-200 entered service in 1998 and the A330-300 back in 1993.<br>
<br>
The Sultanate’s carrier has at least signed a memorandum of understanding to 
lease six 787s from Aviation Lease And Finance Company (ALAFCO), a Kuwait-based 
aircraft leasing firm. ALAFCO is expected to receive the Boeings destined for 
Oman Air in 2012, 2014 and 2015.<br>
<br>
Some of these models have ranges of up to 15,500km, putting North America within 
reach. This would appear to fit with the airline’s development strategy of 
gradually opening up long-haul destinations.<br>
<br>
Oman Air is perhaps rightly not making a bid to be the next Emirates. Its 
development strategy is to deliver more people to Oman at reasonable cost. It is 
certainly not at risk from “imperial overstretch”. Time will tell if the choices 
of Bangkok and Gatwick as the building blocks were the right one. </font></p>

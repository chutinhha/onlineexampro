				Global Distribution System?<br>
				</b>Sabre Travel Network, a Sabre Holdings® company, is the 
				world’s leading provider of high performance travel solutions. 
				Sabre combines its unique expertise and leading technology to 
				help power the business performance of the travel industry, 
				enabling thousands of corporate, leisure and online agencies, 
				corporations, airlines, hotels and other travel suppliers around 
				the world to make money, save money and provide better customer 
				service.<br>
				<br>
				Sabre’s multi-channel merchandising and procurement solutions 
				are backed by Sabre’s industry-leading customer service and 
				socially responsible initiatives that support the communities in 
				which we live and work. Sabre Travel Network connects travel 
				buyers and sellers through the world’s largest travel 
				marketplace, the Sabre® global distribution system (GDS). And, 
				through advanced technological solutions and services that are 
				uniquely ours, we bring travel to life for millions of people 
				each year.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What kind of network of hotels, travel agencies, cruise 
				liners etc does Sabre link across the globe?<br>
				</b>Sabre already provides almost 90,000 hotels in the GDS and 
				this is set to rise rapidly as more hoteliers come onboard. This 
				is in addition to the car and cruise suppliers already available 
				in the GDS. We link more than 55,000 travel agency locations 
				with more than 400 airlines, 88,000 hotels, 24 car rental 
				brands, 13 cruise lines – every type of travel supplier under 
				the sun – enabling them to create unforgettable experiences for 
				travellers and fuel our industry. The Sabre GDS is very 
				powerful. We process over one million transactions per minute, 
				during peak times. Our GDS is the world’s best at finding the 
				lowest fares, saving on average, 10 per cent globally.<br>
				<br>
				<b>In what ways is Sabre Travel Network more efficient or better 
				than its competitors?<br>
				</b>Each year, Sabre invests significantly in R&amp;D to develop 
				innovative new products that help agencies and travel suppliers 
				(airlines, hoteliers etc) make money, save money and provide 
				better customer service. The introduction of new airline 
				ancillary services is a rapidly growing trend, and today, Sabre 
				is the only GDS to support these airline bundling and unbundling 
				activities in the GDS, providing agencies the ability to shop 
				and book new airline ancillary services like pay-for-seats 
				(United Airlines, WestJet etc), and Branded Fares for Qantas.<br>
				<br>
				Sabre is also the first GDS to announce 
				Attribute-Based-Shopping, a new tool allowing agencies to 
				compare shop by ‘airline attribute’ (e.g. baggage fees and seat 
				selection), giving the traveller a total price for their fare.<br>
				<br>
				The use of mobile in travel is also a rising trend. Sabre offers 
				a range of mobile solutions including VirtuallyThere Mobile, 
				giving travellers access to their itinerary on their mobile, and 
				TripCase, a mobile application available on the Apple iPhone, 
				Blackberry and Windows Mobile devices, which provides travellers 
				with itinerary details, updates and notifications throughout the 
				journey of their trip. Another big trend is the use of social 
				networking in travel. Sabre is the only GDS to offer a social 
				networking site called AgentStream, specifically for agencies to 
				connect with each other, share tips, advice and information. 
				AgentStream is currently available in the US and UK, and is 
				being launched in other countries soon.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The year 2009 was a difficult year for the travel and tourism 
				industry worldwide. Has this impacted the financial performance 
				of Sabre?<br>
				</b>Sabre is a well established brand and is the most popular 
				choice of GDS, with more than 40 per cent of the world’s global 
				air booking share. Sabre makes significant investments in R&amp;D, 
				and is continually pushing the envelope with new and innovative 
				solutions that help all its customers make money, save money and 
				provide better customer service. The company’s focus continues 
				to be on helping its customers leverage its technology for cost 
				savings and future growth through the current economic 
				environment.<br>
				<br>
				We are starting to see some strength in the market however 
				recovery in the Middle East is slower than other parts of the 
				world. We expect to see airlines and agencies continuing to seek 
				cost savings while also looking for opportunities to 
				differentiate and grow. There might be more consolidation within 
				the industry, and airlines will continue to explore, experiment 
				and launch new ancillary services to boost revenues and 
				differentiate their product offering. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What kind of a footprint does Sabre have in the Middle East 
				and do you have plans of enhancing your network in the region in 
				2010?<br>
				</b>We are the oldest GDS in the world. Sabre was formed to 
				cater to the needs of the airlines. By listening to our 
				customers, we cater and customise our global solutions to their 
				local needs. This is where we make out mark. With a regional 
				headquarters in Bahrain and offices in Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, 
				Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria, UAE and Yemen, we are very 
				much local but bringing in international and global expertise. </font>

					Gupta, vice president of Infoline started his career with an 
					American publishing house called John Wiley, handling 
					accounts of Europe and the Far East. After having worked at 
					the company for three years he left it and joined India 
					Today as the head of finance. “This was where I learned a 
					lot about the publishing and media industry,” adds Gupta. 
					Following that he joined HCL as the CFO and along with 
					handling whatever he was doing there, in terms of accounts 
					and finance, he was occasionally given the portfolio to 
					handle some business units, it was this that got him into 
					the IT business. Following his stint at HCL, he joined a 
					call centre, again as the CFO but because of the 9/11 
					incident, the company’s COO, who was an American, left 
					overnight and he was asked to handle his work because there 
					was no one else who knew the job. Over time he took over the 
					position and a new CFO was appointed. Following that he came 
					to Oman and joined Infoline and has been here ever since.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Love for literature</b><br>
					“Outside of the office I have a lot of interests, I read a 
					lot and it is something I definitely love doing,” says 
					Gupta. A lover of both, fiction and nonfiction, some of his 
					favourites are books by author Jhumpa Lahiri. He also enjoys 
					old classics and biographies. He added, “My favourite 
					biography till date is that of Nelson Mandela called Long 
					Walk to Freedom.” He also enjoys travelling occasionally, 
					though he prefers avoiding cities whenever possible. “I also 
					like to spend as much time as possible with my family. I 
					believe that whatever time is spent with them has to be 
					quality time.” <br>
					<br>
					“I used to be an avid movie buff when I was in college and 
					used to write a lot of poetry. It was also the time I wanted 
					to take up a career in literature but somehow ended up as an 
					accountant,” he adds, His guides at the time were Saleem 
					Peradina and Nissim Ezekiel. The latter, a professor at 
					Bombay University guided him in writing poems and as a 
					result 30 of his poems got published in a Commonwealth 
					poetry magazine, published in the UK.<br>
					<b><br>
					The greatest influence</b><br>
					At that time he shared a great passion for literature and 
					wanted to take it up as a career. Unfortunately, he did not 
					have the freedom to choose a career like children have now. 
					So, pressure forced him to take up accountancy. 
					“Furthermore, over time, your personal life becomes heavily 
					influenced by corporate life and it becomes very difficult 
					to distinguish between the two. Also, as your career moves 
					you up the ladder in society or moves you to different 
					countries, you tend to drift away from your old passions and 
					friendships. Also as time passes, your friends' habits and 
					lifestyle change, just like yours, making it all the more 
					difficult to retain their friendships. At the end only a few 
					of your closest friends, if any, are left and your passions 
					and hobbies usually take a back seat to your regular life 
					and career,” says Gupta as he explains his reasons for 
					giving up on his career as a poet. Regardless of this fact, 
					he is perfectly content with his current career path and has 
					no regrets. He has thoroughly enjoyed the seven years that 
					he has spent in Oman and still writes whenever he gets the 
					time. <br>

				Second Cup International, Canada’s largest coffee café 
				franchisor and a fast growing international brand is planning an 
				ambitious expansion in Oman and other countries of the Middle 
				East. It also has plans to strengthen its presence across 
				Europe.<br>
				<br>
				Steven Tsambalieros, president of Second Cup International says, 
				the company wants to triple its presence in Oman in the next few 
				years. “The Second Cup has a presence in Oman since 2004 and we 
				are doing good business in the Sultanate,” he said.<br>
				<br>
				<b>In expansion mode<br>
				</b>“We have got a very strong presence in the Middle East and 
				we have franchisees in all the GCC countries. We want to further 
				strengthen it. We are opening in Cyprus shortly and our plan to 
				open in Morocco is also progressing. We plan to cover the Middle 
				East fully in the coming years,” he added.<br>
				<br>
				He said the growth of the chain was slow in 2009 because of the 
				impact of the global economic slowdown. But there was little 
				impact on our sales, he added. We plan to open 15-20 cafes this 
				year, and over 55 cafes next year, he said. Our aim is to make 
				our presence in two to three new countries a year, he said. We 
				also plan to open outlets in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic 
				and Serbia. We are in discussions to open cafes in India and 
				South Africa also, he added.<br>
				<br>
				Tsambalieros said consumers and consumption of coffee were 
				showing a healthy growth. A lot of young people are taking to 
				coffee drinking. Jim Ragas vice president, international 
				business development and operations said Second Cup offers over 
				15 types of coffee. The types available with the Second Cup 
				include Discovery Series (Estate Coffees) which are premier 
				coffees produced in limited quantities on a specific farm that 
				gives them unique characteristic, single-origin coffees which 
				are coffees from a single country or region and Decaffeinated 
				coffees which are 99.9 per cent less caffeine.<br>
				<br>
				He said the local franchise could select the variety of coffees 
				to be served based on the customer taste as they the best beans 
				in the world from organic coffee cultivators. <br>
				<br>
				Tsambalieros said the second cup has plans to introduce a few 
				new tastes in the market soon. Hani Ali Mirza, partner and 
				managing director Bin Mirza International who are the 
				franchisees of Second Cup in Oman said flexibility is the main 
				part of their local operations. We offer local tastes. Our 
				concept is that of a ‘neighbourhood oasis’ which is within the 
				reach of local people.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				He said as a part of the corporate social responsibility 
				initiatives, the outlet has associated itself with Omani Society 
				For Fine Arts and offers opportunity for local artists to 
				exhibit their works in the café. Apart from coffee, the Second 
				Cup also offers thirteen varieties of teas and a wide variety of 
				specialty beverages which include low fat ones. To go along with 
				coffee and tea, Second Cup outlets offer great food to customers 
				which include pastries, desserts, cookies and other dishes.

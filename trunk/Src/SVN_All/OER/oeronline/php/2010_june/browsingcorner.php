					book combines a comprehensive analysis of the global 
					economic meltdown with smart management advice on how to win 
					in an era of great competition.<br>
					<br>
					This book is a tour of the Great Recession and its 
					aftermath. It tells the truth, the whole truth, and reveals 
					major facts and failings. The authors do an exceptional job 
					of describing the current economy and decisions that lead to 
					the current situation. They also effectively layout the 
					potential future outcomes based on actions being taken 
					worldwide right now. The book explains the global impact of 
					US economic decisions as they relate to the bailout and 
					more.<br>
					<br>
					This is essential reading right now because it is one of the 
					best reviews of the changing consumer mindset as well as 
					building a road map for the future of businesses. The 
					authors shed light on the businesses that they expect to 
					grow in the future. They don’t just offer pie in the sky 
					take profit approaches, but rather focus on solid 
					opportunities that exist for companies to build a foundation 
					on.<br>

					brief look</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					The structure of this book is easy to follow and understand. 
					The first part offers a summary of the recession and 
					explains the new world after, what the authors call, the 
					great recession, including an interesting take on the new 
					role of politicians.<br>
					<br>
					The book researches companies like GM, Ford and Chrysler. 
					The business model of these three companies are totally out 
					of date, but in the 1930s and 1940s they were able to beat 
					their competitors. Similarly, there are several other 
					interesting examples from the last century that are 
					highlighted. These examples show as to how hard it is to use 
					basic strategies in a successful manner. Additionally, the 
					book offers some great details on how some of today’s best 
					known companies became leaders in their fields. <br>
					<br>
					The authors use examples from the great depression, the 
					recessions of the 1970’s and 1980’s as well as Japan’s lost 
					decade to build a model of the future. They are also quick 
					to point out that while the bailout of the US economy 
					probably stopped us from sliding into a deep depression, 
					that those ideas were floated during the Great Depression 
					but not implemented. As a result we have no idea as to what 
					will happen as a result, it may take a completely different 
					path and we could see another deeper depression in the short 
					term, especially if there (and there likely will be) another 
					huge round of foreclosures.<br>
					<br>
					An interesting fact from the book was that in 1950 it took 
					one dollar in credit to create one dollar of Gross Domestic 
					Product (GDP), today it takes five dollars of credit to 
					create one dollar of GDP. With tightening credit 
					restrictions it makes it much harder for the economy to 
					grow.<br>
					<br>
					In the second part readers can find a lot of well-known 
					strategies that are more or less all taught in B-school’s. 
					They are interesting to read but not new. Applying them is 
					what is hard and neither this nor any other book can tell 
					you how to do so. However, reading them is a great 
					refresher.<br>
					<br>
					The book does an astute study of new consumer behaviour and 
					this is particularly helpful for those in the retail 
					industry to think through new strategies. This is an 
					exceptional book which has something for every business 
					owner. The book is a nice read and has a clear message, 
					unlike other books from consultancies.</font></p>                </td>

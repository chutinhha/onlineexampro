World sells US port assets to AIG Global </b><br>
DP World, UAE-based giant port company, has sold its holdings to a unit of 
US-based company AIG Global Investment Group, ending the most contentious deal 
in the recent past. While the actual deal has been kept under wraps, the company 
admitted to gaining about US$750 million from the sale. DP World, controlled by 
the government of Dubai, sold terminal operations of six ports including New 
York/New Jersey and Philadelphia, cargo-handling activities in 16 eastern 
seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico ports, besides a passenger terminal in the New 
York City. AIG’s asset management unit – AIG Global Investment Group – will take 
control of the port operations.<br>
Acquired from Peninsular &amp; Oriental Holdings of Britain in early 2006, the U.S. 
ports are said to be now worth $7.6 billion. But the deal ran into trouble as 
the U.S. politicians, cutting across party lines, rigorously opposed the deal. 
They were of the view that Dubai’s ownership of American assets could be a 
potential threat to the country’s security, The protectionist measures laid down 
by the US has attracted mixed reactions from the investors based in the Middle 
East.<br>

paper from Xerox</b><br>
A paper that self-erases content within 16-24 hours will certainly find a good 
number of supporters. Xerox research wing, in partnership with Palo Alto 
Research Center (PARC), is in the process of inventing such a paper. The 
advantages of self-erasing documents are obvious – the paper turns into a new 
sheet within hours and can be used quite a few times, thus reducing paper 
wastage and helping our environment; and keeping alive the affinity towards pen 
and paper doodling. <br>
<br>
Xerox has filed for patents on the ‘erasable paper’ Technology, and PARC 
researchers have developed a prototype printer which creates on-page content 
using a light bar. This bar provides a specific wavelength of light as the 
writing source. The content then fades naturally over time. Alternately, it can 
be immediately erased after exposure to heat. <br>
<br>
The good news for businesses and homes is money saved, as the PARC printers will 
not need new toner cartridges every couple of months. But everything depends on 
how secure is the fading out of the content.<br>

accepts Macquarie takeover</b><br>
Macquarie Bank takes over Australia’s flagship airline Qantas for US 8.7 billion 
(A$11.1bn). Shareholders will now accept A$5.60 a share, 33 per cent higher than 
a month ago when takeover speculation began. In the consortium Airline Partners’ 
Australia, Macquarie will own about 15 per cent of the shares – with the 
Australian finance company Allco being the largest shareholder through several 
subsidiaries. The Texas Pacific Group will hold less than 15 per cent, while 
Canada’s Onex Corp owns 9 per cent, and other foreign investors take up the 
remaining 15 per cent. This is in keeping with the current ownership law, which 
dictates that an investor cannot own more than 25 per cent of the firm’s shares, 
while no foreign company can hold a majority stake. <br>
<br>
The new owners reassured the labour unions that the airline will not be broken 
up, and overseas and regional routes will not be hived off. Despite suffering 
from the steep increase in fuel prices in recent years, Qantas remains one of 
the few global carriers to return a profit.<br>

modernisation worth US$2.6 trillion</b><br>
Airbus Global Market Forecast 2006 predicts that about 23,000 new passenger and 
freight aircraft, valued at US$2.6 trillion, will be needed by aircraft 
operators in the period between 2006 and 2025. This requirement has been worked 
out on the basis of 4.8 per cent average annual traffic growth in revenue 
passenger kilometres (RPKs). In real terms, it means two and half times 
passenger traffic growth – and 14,600 more aircraft to the world fleet. Freight 
tonne kilometres (FTKs) are forecast to increase by six per cent annually over 
the same period, generating the need for 3,580 more freighters.<br>
<br>
The forecast predicts a higher replacement rate of over 12,000 aircraft due to 
an increasing demand for higher fuel-efficient airliners – to help control 
airline operating costs plus environmental concerns. Long distance routes like 
trans-Pacific, Europe-Asia and trans-Atlantic will see an increase by 60 per 
cent. The hub cities will see their traffic nearly doubling over the next 10 
years. Since 2000, there has been a 30 per cent growth in the number of seat 
availability, thus encouraging new operators in the emerging economies.<br>
<br>
The forecast, the result of a detailed analysis of current driving force of air 
transport that quantifies airline demand over the next 20 years, says that more 
than 70 per cent of all aircraft delivered between 2006-2025 will be 
single-aisled (100 – 220 seats). This translates to more than 15,300 aircraft, 
or 42 per cent by value of all passenger aircraft delivery. The 2006 report 
includes the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for the first time, and a 
number of dedicated regional carriers have been added to the existing list of 
more than 400 airlines.<br>

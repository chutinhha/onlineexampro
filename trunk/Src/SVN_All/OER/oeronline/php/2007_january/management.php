The instinct to mark territories and own domains is most apparent in top 
executives. But do theynecessarily make alpha leaders?<br>
By Theodore Kinni</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="management.jpg" width="194" height="248" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2">Alpha 
males lead wolf packs, chimpanzee communities and, according to Kate Ludeman and 
Eddie Erlandson, authors of the new Alpha Male Syndrome: When Strengths Become 
Liabilities (Harvard Business School Press), most businesses. The authors don’t 
have any hard proof of this assertion, but based on their experience as 
executive coaches with an impressive list of clients including Michael Dell and 
Meg Whitman, they “estimate that alphas comprise about 75 per cent of top 
executives.”<br>
<br>
If you associate alphas with “Chainsaw Al” Dunlap and Wall Street’s Big Swinging 
Dicks, this might sound like the opening of an indictment of corporate 
leadership. But in “Alpha Male Syndrome,” the first-time authors take a more 
balanced view of the breed.<br>
<br>
On one hand, Ludeman and Erlandson, who identify themselves as alphas, portray 
their brethren much like the Prime Movers of Objectivist philo-sopher and Atlas 
Shrugged author Ayn Rand. “Make no mistake: the world needs alpha males,” they 
write. Alphas are “world beaters,” whose courageous leadership, goal-driven 
focus and unwavering sense of responsibility are essential ingredients of 
progress.<br>
<b><br>
The Dark Side</b><br>
Unlike Rand, however, these authors fully acknowledge the dark side of alphas. 
It turns out that world-beaters are often also power-abusers. When they are “not 
at their best,” alphas can be “unaware, out of balance, or out of control.” At 
their worst, the authors explain, “alpha anger is explosive, alpha 
competitiveness is ruthless, and alpha aggressiveness and urgency is in the red 
zone.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="management1.jpg" width="120" height="97" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2">Ludeman and Erlandson map this balance as the ‘alpha syndrome continuum.’ 
Picture George Washington, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King Jr. on one 
end and Genghis Khan, Joseph Stalin and villain du jour Saddam Hussein on the 
other. Then, according to the authors: “Most alpha males inhabit the middle 
range. To one degree or another, they fluctuate between healthy and unhealthy 
alpha tendencies: their magnetic leadership commands respect, but their 
aggressive tactics create resistance, resentment and revenge; they are 
celebrated for their achievements but loathed for the carnage they leave in 
their wake; people stand in awe of their competence and can-do energy, but they 
often hate reporting to them or teaming with them.”<br>
<br>
Hence, the alpha male syndrome in which the qualities of the hero and rogue are 
present in the same boss. This, suggest the authors, also explains the 
spectacles to which we are so often treated by high-profile execs and 
entrepreneurs, such as Michael Eisner and Martha Stewart, who accomplish 
prodigious feats of business and then, just as brilliantly, implode.<br>
Unlike their estimate of the number of alpha males swinging through the 
corporate jungle, Ludeman and Erlandson offer up some hard evidence for 
existence of their syndrome. They have created an ‘Alpha Assessment’ and 
administered it to just over 1,500 people, all of whom “worked full time in the 
business world, many in high-ranking business positions” and 77.5 per cent of 
whom supervised others.<br>
<b><br>
Four Alpha Types</b><br>
To help you identify your inner alpha, the authors define the four alpha types 
that they see most often in their practice: commanders, visionaries, strategists 
and executors.<br>
Commanders are charismatic leaders – decisive, strong, and confident. They’re 
also domineering, intimidating, and prone to jealousy and argument.<br>
<br>
Visionaries are inspiring, creative seers who see the best paths forward. They 
can also be overconfident, ignoring reality and spinning the truth when it 
doesn’t fit their version of the future.<br>
<br>
Strategists are objective and highly analytical, able to synthesis complex data 
sets in a single bound. They are also know-it-alls, smug and arrogant.<br>
<br>
Executors are relentless in the pursuit of organisational goals. They are also 
overly critical and prone to setting a killing pace.<br>
<br>
The core of the book is four chapter-length descriptions, one for each type, 
that include type strengths and problems, male/female type differences, 
self-improvement tools for the alpha type and advice for working with the type. 
Oddly, these chapters are often reminiscent of astrological readings. If your 
moon is in alpha-commander, you will read, for instance, that you have to shine 
while allowing others to shine, compete by collaborating effectively and blow 
minds with your competence and strength while also winning hearts with fairness 
and empathy. You need to stand tall without making others seem small, take 
charge and also share control, and earn acclaim and also give credit.<br>
<br>
Alpha Male Syndrome does leave some questions unanswered. An alpha leader is all 
well and good in a wolf pack, but do you want one running your company? How many 
leaders are actually alphas, and how do they stack up against the ones who 
aren’t? Do alpha males actually make the world go round, or does their outsized 
ambition simply drive them to glom onto the best offices in the organisations 
that make the world go round?<br>
<br>
Philosophical questions aside, if you lead or aspire to lead, “Alpha Male 
Syndrome” offers an interesting take on leadership as well as practical 
behaviour-modification techniques. If you work for a dysfunctional alpha, you 
can read the book for hints on how to work together more effectively. Unless you 
have more than your fair share of alpha risks, which might make it far more 
satisfying to tell the boss to shove it and heave the book at him.<br>

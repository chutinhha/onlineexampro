			<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>As ICT spend is going up in the 
			Middle East, gaming is spreading at a rapid pace in the region. 
			According to an industry estimate, the Middle East gaming market is 
			expected to be worth US$ 377 million in the next five years. 
			Currently, it is pegged at US$ 67 million. What’s fuelling the 
			growth?</b><br>
			Gaming today isn’t just about entertainment, says Mohammed Al 
			Maskari, Director General, Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM). “It’s about 
			education and training. It’s about using games to help people learn 
			about managing money, fighting disease, preparing emergency services 
			to deal with natural disasters, training air force pilots, guiding 
			geologists on digging oil wells, through to helping my children 
			learn English and keeping them occupied at the weekend!”<br>
			<br>
			Taking the lead in promoting gaming in the region, Oman hosted 
			‘eGames – The State of Play’, a premier two-day conference for the 
			gaming community. The event, organised by KOM, drew participants 
			from leading operators, developers and academics from Singapore, 
			Sweden, the UK, the UAE and Canada besides Oman and the Gulf region.<br>
			<b><br>
			Gaming on the move</b><br>
			The gaming market is going through a major transformation. So far, 
			PCs and consoles dominated. But mobile phones are fast becoming the 
			preferred choice, especially among the youth and those who have 
			adopted gaming recently. Currently, 40 per cent of the two billion 
			mobile devices are gaming enabled. In 2008, 97 per cent of all 
			mobile handsets will be gaming enabled. Once this happens, mobile 
			gaming, currently less than 10 per cent of the gaming market, will 
			explode and overtake other gaming devices by a wide margin.<br>
			<br>
			“Compare this to videogames where over the past 25 years, 500 
			million consoles have been sold, as against 600 million mobiles sold 
			just in the last 12 months. The figures are amazing and so are the 
			opportunities,” informed Mohammed. Mobile gaming has a unique edge 
			over other gaming devices; prospective gamers already own the 
			platform on which they can play the game unlike other console-based 
			gaming.<br>
			<br>
			“The advancement in mobile handset technology, such as large colour 
			screens and capacity, compact physical size, in addition to 
			developments in 3G, EDGE and Java will enable the market to realise 
			the potential of mobile handsets as fully-fledged gaming devices,” 
			added Mohammed.<br>
			<br>
			Conducive market conditions for growth are another notable trend in 
			the region. “The telecom market in the Middle East is moving into a 
			more de-regulated environment. It is leading to more competition and 
			forcing the operators to stand out distinctly in the market. In such 
			an environment, they need to differentiate and position themselves 
			uniquely with value added services such as games,” said Andreas 
			Johnsson, Director-Business Development, Connected Media Centre, 
			Middle East Ericsson. <br>
			<br>
			Besides service operators, the business growth of technology 
			providers also relies on the expansion of value added services like 
			mobile gaming. According to an Ericsson study, 32 per cent of mobile 
			users in the UAE and Saudi Arabia play games at least once a week. 
			These numbers outperform other mobile services like MMS, portal 
			browsing and listening to music or even mobile TV.<br>
			<br>
			Talking about new technologies in mobile gaming, Charlotte Skanstad, 
			Project Manager, LM Ericsson said, “The new IMS-based multimedia 
			services will change the users’ communication experience where they 
			will be able to combine various content and communication, share 
			these with others and invite multiple contacts. This is a very 
			exciting development. Online gaming can run between mobile phones 
			and PCs and fixed line phones and PDAs.”<br>
			<b><br>
			<img border="0" src="egames3.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="97">Time 
			to Shape Up</b><br>
			Despite high interest levels and immense growth potential, the 
			region needs to get its act together fast. An interactive platform 
			such as the eGames conference is a step in the right direction but 
			that’s not sufficient. According to one of the speakers at the 
			event, the region lacks an entrepreneurial environment to localise 
			and push market growth. There are very few gaming development 
			companies to support the market requirement for creation of games. 
			Instead of relying on content from other markets, Arab countries 
			need to create local content to connect with a wider base of gamers. 
			“It’s high time telecom operators, technology providers and others 
			with vested interest come forward and create an eco system of value 
			services,” said Johnsson. <br>
			<br>
			Talking about effective promotion of eGames, Bilal Saleh, Director, 
			EMEA/LAC Application Services, Motorola, said: “A key issue for 
			games vendors is getting people to discover, try then buy. The cost 
			of acquisition and the low conversion to sale has meant many spend 
			as much as US$ 10-20 to get a user to buy something. If they buy a 
			game and leave, the user is not profitable. No wonder, nearly all 
			meaningful sales of games are on deck (i.e. using the operator’s 
			marketing budget – this is even true for the biggest gaming 
			vendors). Effective retailing remains the number one factor in 
			mobile gaming success and developers need to be aware of this from 
			the outset. Personalisation, flexible pricing and smart retailing 
			are key parts of the mobile gaming ecosystem.”<br>

			Gen Next 3D Technology </b><br>
			The 27-year-old Tony Welch, former automation engineer of Cisco 
			Systems, is all set for changing the future of eGames. The CEO and 
			founder of Fountain Consulting has developed a 3D technology called 
			the Vortex Home Entertainment System. It is expected to launch the 
			true era of high-def 3D for games apart from movies and TV, etc. It 
			starts with a library of 500 current PC based games titles converted 
			to flawless 3D, and even the ability to convert 2D live television 
			into 3D live television, as well as pre-recorded movies on DVD, Blu-ray 
			and HD DVD. Besides making their own modifications to existing 
			high-end NVIDIA cards and putting it into their own PC systems, 
			which will sell pre-loaded with 150 top PC games, Windows XP and 
			Vista, and a special interface that can be controlled from a games 
			console controller (in addition to being easily controlled by a 
			standard keyboard and mouse), Fountain Consulting also aim to sell a 
			pack for US$ 150 that allows anyone with the same hardware to modify 
			their own system to mak<b><img border="0" src="egames2.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="191"></b>e 
			it 3D compatible. One really need to see a demo of the system 
			playing the latest games, in 3D, with a pair of standard 3D glasses 
			(similar to those handed out at IMAX or Real D cinemas), to truly 
			appreciate how much better the game looks in 3D. The depth, the 
			explosions, the action and the detail are enhanced to a new 3D 
			level.</font></p>

			Oman Mobile has launched an Omani eGame ‘Shaking Funjan (Coffee 
			Cup)’ to follow-in the footsteps of the success of first game ‘Forts 
			Adventure’. The new mobile game is designed by four female engineeri 
			ing students from the Sultan Qaboos University, the winners of 
			‘Student Gamer Challenge 2006’. The student’s team went to Amsterdam 
			to interact with Dutch experts for the final production of the game. 
			The trip was sponsored by Oman Mobile. The creation of the game was 
			monitored closely by the team to ensi sure that the players of the 
			game learn about Omani traditions and culture.</font></p>

Higher Education: Going Private</font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 13pt"><br>

<font face="Verdana" size="1">
<b><br>
As Omanisation gathers pace and the demand for skilled workforce grows, it is 
imperative to have more institutes offering higher education.</b><br>
<br>
Availability of a skilled workforce is a major 
determinant in attracting foreign investment and in giving the Sultanate a 
comparative advantage in the global economy.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="economy.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="7">Demand for skilled labour has been on the rise, as visible in the employment 
trends of the expatriate workforce. The university educated segment of 
expatriate labour has grown by 20.4 per cent in the first eight months of the 
year, a total increase of 8000.<br>
<br>
As Omanisation quotas keep increasing, it is necessary for the government to 
ensure that the appropriate workforce is available. The demand for higher 
education institutes is expected to keep growing rapidly in the coming years, 
providing a good opportunity for private investment. <br>
HE Rawya al Busaidi, Minister of Higher Education, told OBG that, “the balance 
is shifting from a predominantly state funded, governed and operated system to 
an increasing emphasis on the private sector.”<br>
<br>
The newest private institution to be launched in autumn 2007, the Oman-German 
University of Technology (OGTech), submitted its proposed curriculum to the 
ministry of higher education (MoHE) in October. <br>
<br>
The University, a joint partnership of local investors and Germany’s University 
of Aachen, will focus on vocational training initially offering courses in five 
technical disciplines including Mechanical Engineering and Tourism Management. 
These might be expanded to other subjects depending on technical needs of the 
market, said Christopher Hilgers, OGTech Project Manager. <br>
<br>
Private higher education has been picking up pace in recent years. Currently 
there are 22 private higher education institutes (HEIs) with estimated 17,000 
new entrants per year, according to the MoHE. The HEIs encompass three 
universities and 19 colleges. <br>
<br>
Out of a total higher education student population of 50,000 the private sector 
thus represents a large number. Private education has played an important role 
in “allowing thousands more student access to higher education,” said HE al 
Busaidi. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="economy1.jpg" width="200" height="131" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2">Another development in higher education has been the shift in the variety of 
degrees offered. Higher education is now more focused towards job orientated 
programs. HE al Busaidi told OBG that the emphasis had changed from “education 
for education’s sake to a diverse system with a good balance in academic and 
vocational orientation.”<br>
<br>
However, an issue of concern is the actual quality of the education offered by 
the private institutions.<br>
<br>
To address this, the MoHE set up the Oman Accreditation Board (OAB). Despite 
being founded in 2001, its activities have thus far been quite limited. To date, 
they have released a document outlining the general requirements for 
accreditation and only two private colleges have been reviewed.<br>
<br>
The activity is set to increase as this summer, the MoHE announced the 
completion of the draft strategic plan and programmes to train the secretariat 
staff.<br>
<br>
Another important development in the sector in developing a more employable 
graduate workforce is developing partnerships with the private sector to enable 
work placements for students to gain the practical experience. HE al Busaidi 
told OBG that this would be one of the areas of concentration for the MoHE in 
2007. She went on to say that a liaison position would be established within the 
MoHE to promote partnerships between higher education establishments and the 
private sector. This will include the development of job placement centres and 
industry support in research and development programmes. <br>
<br>
The educational level of students prior to entering higher education is placing 
another hurdle for HEIs. <br>
<br>
HE al Busaidi told OBG that students currently graduating from Oman’s school 
system tend to be weak in English and in generic skills such as problem-solving 
and critical thinking. This results in most institutes providing a one or 
two-year foundation course before receiving students in specialised programmes 
of study. <br>
<br>
This has been addressed with the new school education programme entitled the 
Basic and Post Basic Education launched recently, which will have its first 
batch of graduates in 2009. <br>

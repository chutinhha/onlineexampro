<font face="Verdana" size="1">Occupational Health (OH) has not got its due 
importance in the Gulf till now. But all this is set to change. The regional 
conference on Occupational Health at the Al Bustan Palace Hotel, Muscat, was the 
first to be held in the Middle East on the subject. Organised from December 11 
to 13, 2006, it addressed issues of OH, hygiene and safety, both at national and 
regional levels. It also acted as a step towards creating awareness in the 
public and the private sectors about OH practices.<br>
<br>
The conference, sponsored by the Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) in partnership 
with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Manpower, the World Health 
Organisation (WHO), the Sultan Qaboos University, Safety and Occupational Health 
Committee and the Public Authority for Social Insurance (PASI), had the theme 
‘Together – Promoting Regional Occupational Health’. It saw 16 regional, 
national and international experts – from fields as diverse as academia, 
medicine, government, industry, – sharing their experiences on OH, safety norms 
and practices with 500-odd delegates. <br>
<br>
The presentations by eminent speakers made a significant contribution towards an 
understanding of various OH issues – care and safety, international standards, 
using it as an effective business driver, designing programmes suitable to the 
region, and establishing network with professional bodies and experts. The 
conference also saw panel discussions, plenary sessions and workshops that all 
underscored the point that improving health and safety standards at the 
workplace yields higher human as well as capital returns. Leading manufacturers 
of OH and safety equipment, research and training institutes, etc., too 
showcased their profiles at an exhibition organised at the venue.<br>
<b><br>
Underlining Occupational Health significance</b><br>
The opening ceremony of the conference, inaugurated by HE Dr. Juma Bin Ali Juma, 
the Minister of Manpower, saw the participation of various dignitaries, 
including conference chairman Dr Nasser Al Maskery, Chief Medical Officer, PDO, 
John Malcolm, Managing Director, PDO, HE Sayyid Hamed Bin Hilal Al-Busaidi, 
Undersecretary for Labour Affairs, Ministry of Manpower, HE Dr. Ahmed Bin Abdul 
Qader Al-Ghassani, Undersecretary for Health Affairs, Ministry of Health, and Dr 
El Faith El Samani, WHO representative, Sultanate of Oman. <br>
<br>
John Malcolm defined OH as identifying health hazards and taking steps to 
eliminate them. He added that the conference was part of the effort to address 
an issue critical for the Gulf region’s growing economies. He also quoted an 
estimate by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) that 4 per cent of the 
world’s gross national product was lost because of work-related diseases, 
illnesses and injuries.<br>
<br>
Dr Nasser Al Maskery, in his presentation ‘Developing OH culture and practice – 
PDO’s Experience’ said that health was a form of human investment and a 
requirement for economic prosperity. This would entail the need to establish a 
mechanism of standards and best practices at the work place, and a sound 
legislative framework to preserve them. <br>
<br>
Dr David Snashall, President, Faculty of Occupational Medicine, Royal College of 
Physicians, London, in his presentation ‘The role of legislation and voluntary 
activity in OH practice’, dealt with the broad spectrum of legal framework 
available both in the UK as well in UN, ILO, etc. He said that international 
legislations on occupational health and safety ranged from protecting workers 
from health hazards to workers’ right to information and data security.<br>
<br>
Other speakers included Dr Said Arnout, regional adviser, WHO, Eastern 
Mediterranean office, who spoke on ‘OH in the Eastern Mediterranean region’; Dr 
Brian Davis, Associate Professor, University of Wollongong, Australia, who 
discussed the role of occupational hygiene in OH management; Dr, Samir Al Adawi, 
Associate Professor, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sultan Qaboos 
University, spoke on stress management; Prof David Koh from National University 
of Singapore, on shift work; Dr John Luby, head, specialty medical services, 
Saudi Aramco Medical Services Organisation, on management of sickness absence 
and return to work; and Dr John Schneider, Occupational Physician, UAE 
University, on ‘rehabilitation, redeployment and compensation following 
illness/injury’. The first day of the conference ended on the note that a 
healthy workplace requires a healthy workforce, and occupational physicians are 
central to advising employers and employees on the effects of work on health and 
vice versa. <br>
<b><br>
Challenges and prospects </b><br>
The second day of the conference focussed on the challenges in embedding 
occupational healthcare into business, and targeting cost-effective solutions in 
the workplace. It also analysed the risks of occupational hazards in developing 
countries and offered ways to strategic health management planning. Dr. Tawfik 
Khoja, family physician consultant and Director-General, GCC Health Ministers 
Council, in his presentation ‘Occupational health practices in developing 
countries’ said that approximately 45 per cent of the world’s population and 58 
per cent of the population over 10 years of age belonged to the global 
workforce. Citing WHO’s observation, he said that hundreds of millions of people 
throughout the world were employed in conditions that bred ill-health or were 
unsafe. Only 5 to 10 per cent of workers in developing countries and 20 to 25 
per cent in industrial countries were estimated to have access to adequate 
occupational health services, he said. In Gulf countries, he said, there were 
insufficient budgetary resources for Occupational Health, lack of educational 
programmes, and under reporting of occupational morbidity and mortality.<br>
<br>
Dr. Tar Ching Aw, Professor of occupational medicine, University of Kent, UK, 
spoke on ‘Pre-employment medical examinations and fitness standards’, and Dr. 
Bernard Huisman, Vice President, Health, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, on the ‘Cost and 
benefits of OH services in the business’. Dr. Huisman stated that health can’t 
be left to doctors and company managers should come forward and take charge of 
devising a health strategy. He added that the Middle East had the opportunity to 
leapfrog ahead of Europe and other developed countries in health management, 
provided it changed its traditional health approach.<br>
<br>
Dr. Andreas Luedeke, researcher and trainer, BG Institute for Work and Health, 
Germany, in his paper emphasised that safety management system is a value 
driver, as it reduces accidents, raises employees’ motivation, improves product 
quality and workplace atmosphere and enhances company’s image. Citing OH and 
safety norms in Germany, he said there were three main elements of OH — 
prevention, rehabilitation and compensation — and employers in Germany 
considered OH and safety an essential part of the corporate culture.<br>
<br>
Prof. Tee L. Guidotti, from the George Washington University Medical Centre, in 
his presentation ‘Management Systems – Role of OH in economic development’, 
argued that employers should decide whether they wanted to adopt the low cost of 
healthcare or the high cost of disabilities. He further said that OH should be 
treated as an investment and not a cost burden.<br>
<br>
The second day also saw three workshops where delegates and speakers deliberated 
on various topics and came up with suggestions. The topics of the workshops were 
— How to embed OH into public healthcare; Establishing OH education and research 
in the Gulf region; and, What constitutes an effective occupational hygiene 
programme. The workshops held an important position in the overall event as many 
of the suggestions and recommendations emerging from these workshops were later 
amalgamated in the ‘Muscat Declaration’ announced on December 17, 2006.<br>
<b><br>
Health risk assessment </b><br>
On the last day, the conference elaborated on the mechanism and the benefits of 
health risk assessment. It also discussed issues like management of heat stress 
for outdoor workers and repetitive stress injury for office workers that are 
increasingly becoming relevant in the Middle East. Dr. Tawfiq Khoja spoke on 
health risk assessment while Prof. Tar Ching Aw dealt with prevention and 
management of repetitive stress injury. Dr. Khoja said health risk assessment 
basically involves assessing the risks in the workplace by looking for the 
hazards; deciding who might be harmed; evaluating the risks and deciding whether 
the existing precautions are adequate or whether more should be done; recording 
the findings; and reviewing the assessment and revising it if necessary.<br>
<br>
Dr. Mustafa Khogali, from Ahfad University of Women, Sudan, elaborated on 
‘Prevention of work-related heat stress’, while Dr. Mohammad Al Masri, deputy 
head, Protection &amp; Safety Department, Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, and Dr. 
Riad Shweikani, head, Radiation Safety Division, Atomic Energy Commission of 
Syria, presented a paper on ‘Radiological protection from naturally occurring 
radioactive materials’.<br>
<br>
The conference concluded with a presentation on the feedback from the previous 
day’s workshops. The recommendations included the need to highlight importance 
of OH as a medical specialty in the healthcare system; create awareness in 
society about OH; promote OH training in the workplace; and, encourage research 
in the academia on OH and safety. Concluding the conference, chairman Dr. Nasser 
Al Maskery, Chief Medical Officer, PDO, remarked, ”The issue has been touched 
and it has been processed in the right direction. But the mission is still not 
accomplished.”</font></p>

sector have been bonding together to ensure the safety of employees and provide

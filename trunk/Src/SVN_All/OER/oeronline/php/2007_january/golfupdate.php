I asked a colleague of mine how did he perform in the big golf tournament over 
the weekend. He just gave me an ugly look and said, “It was so bad, I lost two 
in the ball washer.” </b><br>
<br>
The ubiquitous golf ball. Its humble appearance belies the complicated 
manufacturing process behind it. Over time, it’s not only the professionals and 
the game that has undergone substantial modifications; even the golf ball has 
seen radical changes. The manufacturing process for golf balls has evolved as 
much, if not more, than the balls themselves. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gup.jpg" width="70" height="69" align="left">The first 
clubs and balls were made of wood. In fact, the earliest documented reference to 
the game of golf dates to the year 1550, which talks about one John Daly playing 
with a wooden ball. It was in 1618 that the feather ball or ‘Featherie’ was 
introduced. Handcrafted, the ball was made with goose feathers, tightly packed 
into a horse or cowhide sphere. The feathers and the leather were given the 
shape of a ball when still wet. As the assembly dried out, the leather shrank 
and the feathers expanded to create a hardened ball. After this, the finishing 
was carried out by painting the ball. Notable ball-makers of the 1600s were 
Andrew Dickson, Leith and Henry Mills, St Andrews. The Scottish manufacturer, 
Allan Robertson, is reported to have made about 2,500 leather and feather balls 
in 1844. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gup1.jpg" align="left" width="70" height="69">The Gutta 
Percha ball or ‘Guttie’ introduced in 1848 by Reverend Adam Paterson was made 
from the rubber-like sap of the Gutta tree found in the tropics. When heated, 
the rubber could easily be moulded into a sphere and used as a golf ball. Not 
only was this economical to produce, it also had the advantage of being repaired 
by re-heating and re-shaping. Initially, Gutties possessed a smooth surface, 
which meant that they didn’t travel as far as the Featheries. It was in 1905 
that the surface of the ball began to sport the dimpled pattern. Introduced by 
William Taylor to a Haskell ball, it gave the ball the shape and form that it 
continues to retain till this day. The dimple pattern maximised the lift while 
minimising the drag. Today, more than 150 years later, modern golf ball 
manufacturers produce nearly one billion balls annually (almost 2,000 per 
minute). <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gup2.jpg" align="left" width="70" height="69">Natural and 
synthetic rubber compounds have long replaced the core of the ball that used to 
be made of feather; leather covers have now given way to thermoplastic resins; 
and geometrically sophisticated dimple patterns stretch the limits of 
performance. Today’s premium balls are typically multi-layered in construction. 
Thin, hard mantle and soft urethane cover surround t<img border="0" src="gup3.jpg" align="right" width="108" height="99">heir 
solid cores. Two-piece balls feature a solid core and firm shell often made of 
Surlyn, a less expensive but more shear-resistant material than the urethane 
covers of high-end balls. As such, multi-layer golf balls such as the Titleist 
Pro V1, Precept Tour Premium LS, Strata Tour Ultimate 2, Nike Tour Accuracy, 
Maxfli Revolution and Callaway HX offer the distance benefits of harder-feeling, 
lower-spinning two-piece balls off the tee while providing softer feel and more 
spin around the greens.<br>
<br>
Aerodynamics and materials science have pushed the golf ball to its limits. 
Amongst all the other golf equipment, it’s the little white orb that has 
benefited the maximum from advancing technologies, radically changing the game 
of golf.</font></p>

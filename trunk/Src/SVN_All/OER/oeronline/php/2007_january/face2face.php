<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>How is FINCORP doing?</b><br>
FINCORP is the single-largest investment banking company in Oman. We provide the 
full range of investment banking functions, including corporate finance and 
financial advisory services, asset and fund management, broking services and 
corporate research.<br>
<br>
Currently, major stress in the Sultanate is on privatisation and infrastructure 
development. We are playing a major role in this process. We have handled the 
privatisation of Al Maha Petroleum Products company, and with other partners we 
handled the privatisation of Omantel. FINCORP also handled the government’s 
partial disinvestment of its stake in Oman Flour Mills Co. SAOG. We have also 
worked closely with ministries on various projects. In investment banking, 
especially in corporate finance, there is a shortage of such services in this 
country. They are primarily fee-based and require high calibre of human 
resources. We want to grow our fee-based business from 55 per cent to 80 per 
cent.<br>
<b><br>
Is there a reluctance on the part of your clients to pay?</b><br>
In general, clients are reluctant to pay for investment banking services. Many 
corporates in Oman are not fully aware as to what companies like ours can do for 
them. There is also resistance from the management of some of these companies to 
engage investment bankers to help them, irrespective of their ownership status. 
They feel that we are invading their privacy; whereas in reality we can add real 
value. <br>
<b><br>
Perhaps they hesitate to share information with companies like yours due to the 
fear that you might play dirty?</b><br>
We are a public-listed company. We cannot play dirty games. Confidentiality is 
the guiding factor in our operations. We have to be upright otherwise we will 
lose our credibility in the market. We have even worked with and done corporate 
finance deals for many family-owned businesses…we did our job very well.<br>
<b><br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Don’t you get tempted to do some 
insider trading as you manage funds running in millions of riyals?</b><br>
We can’t do that. It will be picked up very easily by our internal auditor or 
compliance officer or Capital Market Authority (CMA) auditors. Ours is a 
public-listed company and we spend nearly RO100,000 per annum to adhere to 
corporate governance norms. We have internal and external auditors, compliance 
officers, legal advisors and we are subjected to CMA audit every year. They will 
raise questions – why we manage the portfolios in certain ways and why we buy 
and sell shares at specific times and whether this is in compliance with the 
portfolio agreements signed with our clients. These checks and balances keep my 
colleagues in the company alert and vigilant. The ultimate benefactors of these 
controlled procedures are our clients, shareholders and stakeholders.<br>
<b><br>
Is there a Chinese wall between your different divisions?</b><br>
Absolutely. It is never breached. I’ll give you an example. We did the 
restructuring of a public stock company. At that time, its shares were hovering 
around 700-800 Baizas. We knew that after the completion of this assignment, its 
share value in the market would increase substantially. The corporate finance 
division handled this assignment. However, the asset management division of 
FINCORP, which functions on the other side of the Chinese wall, was not aware of 
the assignment and did not pick these shares. They started buying that share 
when it reached the level of RO1.2 when they found that the price is going up as 
a result of the restructuring. That is the advantage of dealing with a 
public-listed company like FINCORP. <br>
<b><br>
What is your assessment of the structure and quality of management in the 
corporate sector?</b><br>
The competition is getting stiff day-by-day. FTAs and WTO are opening the doors 
of competition. And any company that resists change and is not scaling up the 
competence of its management, will ultimately lose out. <br>
<br>
There are issues of favouritism and interference in the functioning of some 
companies. But the management should remain firm. In fact, the shareholders 
should be very selective in choosing their board members. <br>
<b><br>
Is there a shortage of quality people who qualify as board members?</b><br>
I don’t think there is a shortage of quality people. May be, at times, some 
quality people do not get enough votes to be elected. While selecting a board 
member, shareholders should ask this question – is he/she going to add value? It 
is also better to have some independent non-shareholding members on the board.<br>
<b><br>
Applying the same yardstick, how would you describe FINCORP’s board?</b><br>
Almost 80 per cent of FINCORP’s shareholding is controlled by institutions. When 
institutions are buying your shares, it is a good sign; it means that these 
institutions have confidence in the management and the future prospects of the 
company. We at FINCORP have an excellent Board of Directors who are not only 
adding value but also challenging the management at all times and keeping us on 
our toes. <br>
<b><br>
Do you also have independent directors on board?</b><br>
Out of seven board members, we have one independent director. <br>
<b><br>
How is FINCORP strengthening itself to face the days ahead?</b><br>
Our strategy is to build the business on the strength of our people. We work 
towards hiring the people with right blend of professional qualifications and 
experience and invest back in them to upgrade their skills. With the right team 
in place, we can maintain high standards of management and cutting-edge customer 
services to withstand competition from even large multinational companies. <br>
<b><br>
In terms of revenue streams, what is your focus area?</b><br>
We want to reduce our dependence on revenues coming from asset management and 
brokerage, as they are linked to the stock market, which, as you know, is 
volatile. As I said earlier, we intend to move more towards fee-based products 
and services that are more stable and predictable and therefore less volatile. 
Corporate finance and advisory services have a lot of potential on that count.
<br>
<b><br>
What is the size of the corporate finance market and where do you stand?</b><br>
The potential size of the corporate finance market is big although many 
corporates are not tapping it. I believe FINCORP is one of the leaders in 
providing corporate finance services in Oman today.<br>
<b><br>
</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>How big is the gap between you and 
the market leader and what is the reason for it?</b><br>
The gap is there because some banks offer additional services compared to a 
non-banking financial institution like us. Banks by their nature have an unfair 
advantage over us as they have access to a larger clientele ba</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">se. 
They mainta</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><img border="0" src="face2face1.jpg" width="240" height="190" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">in 
thousands of savings and current accounts and also have a large loan book. For 
example, a bank’s asset management division can get to know about individuals/corporates 
maintaining accounts with high balances with its retail division or corporate 
division. The asset management division can approach those retail customers with 
the proposal to manage their unused funds. This is contrary to the regulations 
in Oman and to professional ethics, but it has happened with some of our 
customers who maintain current or savings accounts with them. So, I would urge 
our banking competitors to maintain a strong Chinese wall in their operations.<br>
<b><br>
Have you taken up the issue with the market regulator?</b><br>
In this particular incident where a bank approached our client, we complained to 
the top management of the bank about the matter. They reacted <br>
professionally and promised that they will put a stop to this. Our clients come 
to us for investment banking services, purely based on our marketing skills and 
the quality of services that we provide. We cannot provide other banking 
services such as current accounts or credit cards and the like. So, that’s our 
handicap. <br>
<b><br>
Would FINCORP like to be a bank?<br>
Why not?<br>
Have you applied for the banking license? </b><br>
No, we have not done that.<b><br>
Do you intend to apply in the near future?</b><br>
No. We do not have any plans to do that in the near future but I would not like 
to exclude the possibility of doing so in the future.<br>
<b><br>
Are you eyeing the insurance sector? </b><br>
We have got approval from CMA to look into the creation of the first Omani 
reinsurance company. We are currently working on the feasibility study. The 
report is expected to be ready soon. We will act as an incubator of this new 
company and arrange for the private placement of shares if it is feasible.</font></p>

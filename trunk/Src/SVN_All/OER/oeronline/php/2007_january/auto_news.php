        Think German luxury saloons and by the third attempt you will definitely 
		come up with Audi. Think Bahrain and pretty quickly you will get to the 
		Formula One International Circuit. Put them both together and you have 
		the recipe for a great way of launching the new Audi S models to an 
		automobile crazed Middle Eastern public.<br>
		<br>
		The Audi Paddock Club invited media from around the Gulf to be the first 
		to test-drive their new S-models, to experience first-hand what these 
		cars can do. When we arrived at the Bahrain International Circuit, the 
		brand-new Audis were lined up waiting to be inspected and driven around 
		the circuit and through various driving challenges. The line-up 
		consisted of the Audi S4 and S4 Cabriolet, the Audi S6 and the top of 
		the line sports version of the A8, the Audi S8, freshly shipped over 
		from Germany with certified and highly experienced driving instructors 
		to be launched not only to media but also to VIPs, dealers and 
		enthusiasts over a three-week period.<br>
		<br>
		The S models all come with the legendary Quattro permanent four-wheel 
		drive as standard, giving the cars a high degree of cornering ability 
		and driving enjoyment. To test the manoeuvrability, our first challenge 
		was to drive the Audi S4 cabriolet through a slalom course set up 
		outside the International Circuit, and do it fast. The spaces between 
		the traffic cones was challengingly short, but the challenge was met 
		easily, in my case probably more due to the car’s abilities as compared 
		to the driver’s. <br>
		<b><br>
		Safety Features</b><br>
		Next up was the Audi S6 to show us the Audis’ anti-lock-brake system. 
		Our instructions were to drive as fast as we possibly could – and 
		considering the S-models do 0-60mph in less than six seconds, we 
		certainly could go fast! – towards an obstacle, brake as hard as we 
		could and steer the car to safety alongside the obstacle whilst leaving 
		the foot on the brake. Considering that usually it is impossible to 
		steer whilst braking, this was new territory, but successful achievers 
		were rewarded with the Audi’s hazard-lights coming on, a new safety 
		feature in the S-models. <br>
		<br>
		Having tested the two ‘smaller’ models, next was the beast in the 
		line-up, the truly impressive Audi S8 with its large metal grill, its 
		aluminium trim, mirror casings and lights, together with its 20-inch 
		cast aluminium wheels and four shiny oval tail pipes – the car oozes 
		power. This machine we were allowed to race around the circuit, although 
		only under strictest supervision and the many-a-times repeated warning 
		“This is not a race!” to over-enthusiastic members of the media. After a 
		few practice laps, we finally set off at high speed and that was when 
		the S8 showed its true colours: the engine could barely be heard and 
		although we screeched around tight corners, the car had us under control 
		and not only did we feel extremely safe, but also very comfortable.<br>
		<br>
		So, what’s with the understated luxury, but the sporty driving 
		experience? One motor journalist described the Audi S8 as a luxury 
		saloon with a hyperactive tiger in its tank, and the description cannot 
		be improved on, as although the power, especially of the S8, is obvious, 
		the car looks as if it should be taking executives to a board meeting 
		rather than being able to hold its own on a Formula One race track.<br>
		<b><br>
		Understated Elegance</b><br>
		But that is what makes Audi special – the cars are discreet and 
		understated yet to people in the know speak of un-pretentious elegance 
		and power, like wearing Armani as compared to Versace: you can tell it 
		is a very good product, but it does not smack you in the face with its 
		pretentiousness.<br>
		<br>
		And it is not only the outward elegance and sporty engine, but also the 
		interior that certainly exudes luxury. Apart from the exquisite leather 
		upholstery; the carbon fibre inlays; the three-spoke sporty steering 
		wheel; there are also the seats itself which adjust in every direction, 
		including up, ideal if you are not the tallest person. Then there is the 
		music system, something no car can do without. But in true Audi 
		S8-style, the music system is not any old CD player and radio, it is 
		Bang &amp; Olufsen, the distinctive Danish manufacturer of superior music 
		and media systems, making the music system not just a system, but a 14 
		loudspeaker surround experience. To adjust your music, you simply use 
		the central controller, which comes up with something not unlike a 
		pie-chart on the computer screen; letting you choose your options before 
		giving you further choices of adjustments. There are plenty of buttons, 
		but unlike in some of the other German car models which shall remain 
		un-named here, and which have been widely criticised by motor 
		journalists, the Audi’s MMI – or multimedia interface – is overseeable 
		and relatively easy to use.<br>
		<br>
		The Audi S-class is a remarkable fusion of Audi’s legendary sports cars, 
		with the Quattro – first introduced in 1980 - as standard; the aluminium 
		body and accessories reminiscent of the first Audi race car built back 
		early last century; and the German reliability, quality and luxury that 
		people have come to expect. And on top of it all you have the “Vorsprung 
		durch Technik”, Progress through Technology, which is Audi’s slogan and 
		ace in the pack. If you cannot be persuaded to buy an Audi just by the 
		sheer elegance and luxury of its ex- and interior alone, then test-drive 
		it and let the technology convince you. Only you will be hard-pushed to 
		find as excellent a test-drive location as the Bahrain International 
		Circuit. <br>
		<br>
		The day after the launch I was still dreaming of hurtling along the race 
		track in the S8, but instead was stuck in rush-hour traffic in my own 
		car, which is not German, not comfortable and, alas, does not have 450 
		horse-power to its name, but one can dream. And one day, when I do own 
		an Audi, then it will be a race! <br>

        It’s uber fashionable and showstopping. We are talking about Kue, the 
		Kia crossover concept from Kia Motors Corporation which will make its 
		world premiere at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in 
		Detroit this month. Kia released a preview sketch of the all-new ‘Kue’ 
		concept car last month, which employs a different approach to the 
		crossover utility vehicle segment by taking elements of what makes a CUV 
		to a new level, namely performance. Kue has been designed as a driver’s 
		vehicle. While possessing SUV characteristics and capabilities, the Kia 
		Kue focuses more on giving the driver an exhilarating driving experience 
		on the way to the home improvement centre than on how much it can haul.
		<br>
		The Kia Kue has a monocoque platform that sits on 22-inch tyres with a 
		wheelbase of more than 114 inches, packaged in an overall length of 186 
		inches. Though purely a concept, the Kia Kue does, however, hint at 
		future styling directions for Kia Motors. Watch this space for more 
		details on Kia Kue. <br>

		SEAT presented a Leon car with the latest technological breakthroughs at 
		the recently held Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Congress in 
		London. The technological innovations were devised specially by SEAT, 
		through acute research, to find new forms of driver and vehicle 
		interaction. SEAT’s prototype can adapt its communication strategy in 
		accordance with traffic conditions, the surroundings and the driver 
		himself. SEAT is developing this project in collaboration with the 
		European Union. The Leon prototype was presented keeping in mind real 
		life possibilities, which instigate accidents. For instance, when the 
		driver takes his eyes off the road, the vehicle senses danger and turns 
		on a warning light on the dashboard. The vehicle emits a warning sound 
		and sends vibrations through the steering wheel if it detects that the 
		driver is falling asleep. Such advancements have been achieved by the 
		SEAT team with the use of sensors that control the driver’s eye movement 
		and blink frequency, radars to detect objects, GPS and other specific 
		communication networks. <br>

        <b>The Phantom arrives</b><br>
		It has finally happened. The ultimate in luxury is in town. The much 
		talked about elitist automobile brand Rolls Royce was launched in Oman 
		last month. Al Jenaibi Automobiles, the exclusive dealers for BMW and 
		MINI, have brought Rolls Royce to Oman with launch of the Phantom in Al 
		Bustan Palace hotel on December 10. The Phantom has been a topper where 
		class, stateliness and super luxury is concerned. Speaking about the 
		entry of Rolls Royce into Oman, Axel Obermuller, Managing Director for 
		Europe and Middle East of the brand said, “Oman is a growing market; one 
		that has a lot of potential. The Omani economy has been registering a 
		stable growth even if it is slow. We knew that opportunities are plenty 
		in this market and we had to be here.”<br>
		<br>
		The ultra-luxurious automobile Rolls Royce Phantom is an amalgamation of 
		modern technology and craftsmanship keeping intact the glamour of its 
		heritage. The handcrafted car which boasts of interiors that takes 16-18 
		hides to complete, exquisite cabinetry and fine wood veneers is powered 
		by a 6.5-litre V12 engine. This translates to remarkable power, thereby 
		adding to Rolls Royce’s superlatives as one of the most powerful and 
		fastest cars. A car that can be personalised to the T, the Phantom comes 
		with exemplary features that include plush interiors, LCD screens for 
		the backseat passengers, in-built umbrella and much more. The star 
		attraction definitely is the retractable Spirit of Ecstasy, the figurine 
		that is synonymous with the brand name. Bespoke models, or customised 
		cars, will require a minimum of four months for delivery. Al Jenaibi 
		Automobiles is equipped to handle after sales and troubleshooting 
		services for Rolls Royce.<br>

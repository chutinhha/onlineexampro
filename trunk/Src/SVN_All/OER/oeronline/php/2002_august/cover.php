                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">James Hogan, 45, the new President and Chief Executive of the embattled Gulf Air, enjoys rugby. He is also a staunch supporter of Australia's top rugby club Essendon. But Hogan, now busy preparing a three-year recovery plan for Gulf Air, would require much more than his rugby skills to pilot the once leading airline back to profits.<br>
                    <br>
                    Hogan came on board as the CEO on May 12 this year. And in less than three weeks at the helm of the Bahrain-based carrier, he received his first jolt. At the Extraordinary General Body Meeting (EGBM) of Gulf Air on May 29, Qatar, one of Gulf Air's four promoters, issued a notice to the airline's board saying that it was not interested in promoting the company any longer. According to the 'Articles of Association' of Gulf Air, Qatar's retraction would come into effect after six months from the date of notice.<br>
                    <br>
                    In a way, Qatar's self-alienation came as no surprise, since its own carrier Qatar Airways (QA) has been adding new destinations and increasing its fleet. The market also speculated that Oman might follow suit, since the country's carrier Oman Air, has been focussing on expanding its network and has huge promotion plans up its sleeve. Even then, fortunately for Hogan, Muscat decided to continue its support to Gulf Air. On May 29, the rest of the three promoters - Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Oman - pledged to infuse BD10 million each (a total of US$81 million) into the carrier as the first tranche of funds, although the airline had reportedly demanded US$275.5 million as its total fund requirement.<br>
                    <br>
                    But Hogan, a former Chief Operating Officer of the UK's second largest airline, British Midland (BMI) and also briefly the CEO of the collapsed Australian airline Ansett (he says the airline wound up not because of him but since the owners refused to revive the carrier), is not jittered and is prepared for a life without Qatar. Hogan is drawing up a turnaround strategy with an emphasis on improved customer service, a sound network plan and cost reduction by trimming the bureaucracy.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What went wrong?</b><br>
                    Gulf Air's biggest problem has been its mounting losses and the declining passenger revenues. Its losses bulged by a massive 30 per cent from US$98.1 million to US$132.3 million in 2001. Also, with rising competition from regional airlines like Emirates, Qatar Airways, Oman Air and Saudi Airlines, the carrier has been facing a lot of heat. Reports suggest that the airline's accumulated debts would total about US$800 million.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ask Hogan what went wrong with the airline and he would shy away from answering the question. "Let's not speculate on that, as I wasn't here. All I can tell you is that the people who have led this company earlier have done so with right intentions," he says.<br>
                    <br>
                    In fact, Gulf Air's problems started with the entry of Emirates Airline into the Middle East skies in 1985. Emirates positioned itself as an intercontinental airline and chose Dubai as its hub, which is by far the largest in the region, handling about 30 million passengers a year. The next biggest hub in the region is Abu Dhabi with a traffic of 3.5 million people a year.<br>
                    <br>
                    But Gulf Air has four hubs - Muscat, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Doha - and could not focus on any of them. "The four different governments who own Gulf Air had four different agendas to pursue. This affected the airline's business judgement and profitability," says a seasoned industry watcher.<br>
                    <br>
                    Also, with Emirates' entry, the region's aviation industry was never the same again. With the advantage of its base in Dubai, Emirates was able to offer its services not just to the Gulf region but was also bringing in transit traffic (comprising 50 per cent of its total traffic). But Gulf Air could not cash in on the ongoing Dubai wave as much as Emirates did.<br>
                    <br>
                    Says an industry source, "Gulf Air top bosses knew that in order to survive, they needed to restructure the business. But they failed to do so for various extraneous reasons." In fact, Gulf Air's ownership structure has been a big hindrance to any bid for revamping the airline, adds the industry watcher.<br>
                    <br>
                    A classic example of this would be the one of 1998-99, when Emirates had just about extended its service to Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), although it was already flying into Nairobi (Kenya) and Johannesburg (South Africa). Until then Gulf Air had a strong hold on the East African market and was considered to be the only link to Gulf destinations with a well-established base in Zanzibar. Adding to the worries of Gulf Air, Emirates, which was allowed to operate only two flights a week into Dar es Salaam, slowly managed to increase the frequency to four flights a week, and also started offering direct flights to Dubai.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    People started preferring Emirates as a time saving airline offering decent services. This was at a time when Gulf Air was still flying out of Zanzibar with a minimum frequency of two flights a week and with a transit in Muscat before reaching Dubai.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moreover, Emirates' irresistible special offers during shopping and summer festivals soon resulted in Gulf Air flights going empty. As a consequence, Gulf Air was forced to follow what Emirates was doing, including offering one ticket free alongwith a US$400 worth return ticket. Plus, Emirates' prime destination company, Emirates Holidays started selling to the elite to route their European, American and Far Eastern journeys via Dubai. The rest, of course, is history.<br>
                    <br>
                    Today, Emirates has grown into an airline which constantly increases its fleet and flies to more than 58 destinations in Europe, the Far East, Africa and Australia, besides others. But its elder cousin Gulf Air (established in 1974), on the other hand, has not been able to grow beyond a 32-aircraft fleet and a 50-destination network. Gulf Air is facing competition not just from Emirates, but also from the much younger airlines like Oman Air and Qatar Airways, interestingly owned by two of Gulf Air's promoters.<br>
                    <br>
                    Oman Air, established in 1993, claims to be the market leader for all traffic in and out of Oman and is putting in place a strategy to sell Oman as a hot tourist destination. The airline has nine aircraft and operates to more than 22 destinations, which would put a lot of pressure on Gulf Air's business in Oman.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Gulf Air will face a big challenge in Qatar too with its carrier QA planning big expansions. According to Ali Khaliq Ibrahim, Area Manager - Oman, QA has plans to increase its fleet strength from the current 16 aircrafts to 30 and from 35 destinations to 50 by 2004. The cash rich airline also has plans to induct the most advanced Airbus-380 (which is under development) to its fleet by 2007.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sunita Gomes, Country Commercial Manager, British Airways says, "The regional airline industry that recovers from the downturn of the past year is likely to look very different from today's industry. In the past, airlines emerging from a trough adjusted their operations, for instance, by establishing and then improving yield-management systems which price seats in a more discriminating way. In the present downturn in the region, as elsewhere, there are challenges to further cost cutting, such as possible replacement of turboprops by more comfortable jets and coping with the changes in flying habits since September 11 last year."<br>
                    <br>
                    "Given the high levels of excess capacity in the region, any recovery will have to come from continued governmental focus and initiatives on tourism, the revised route rationales, and the long term organisational cost reductions. Indeed cutting capacity in the first instance is critical to cost reduction; but the full impact of various factors on profits in aviation takes time to emerge," she adds.<br>
                    <br>
                    But Hogan is unfazed. "Business is always a challenge. When you consider the brand awareness and the positioning of Gulf Air in the market, especially in the Arab world, we certainly have strong brand recognition. Our challenge is to keep communicating to our customers about the various programmes. But within the company we have to make sure that our various route networks are competitive, and the frequency and the pricing are correct. We definitely have the ingredients to be successful," he says.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    And this optimism is what drives Hogan. He is currently studying the recommendations of Simat Helliesen &amp; Eichner (SH&amp;E), a global aviation consultancy, who was roped in by Gulf Air management last year to draw up a long term business strategy for turning around the carrier. In fact, Hogan was appointed as CEO on the recommendation of SH&amp;E, which is a welcome move away from the usual practice of only public sector officials heading the airline.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The strategy</b><br>
                    Hogan says he is drawing up a three-year restructuring plan to get the airline back on track. The plan will be submitted to the board in September for approval. "The recovery plan is for three years. We will come to you once the board sees it in September," he says.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    A big challenge for Gulf Air is to attract customers and to become the most preferred airline for both inbound and outbound travel in the region. Therefore Hogan's main focus is on providing improved services to the customers and offering convenient connectivity and adequate frequency. In fact, after taking charge as CEO, Hogan has made a few senior level recruitments to focus on marketing and services. A new Services Division has been created, which will be headed by Luke Medley, former CEO of Avis in the UK and Australia and also an ex-Ansett executive. Medley will get support from Peter Rowe, who will head the Customer Service Division. The new role would replace the position of Ground Services, previously held by Peter Cross, who would remain in the customer services department and would assist on project-to-project basis. The new team will focus on improving cost and efficiencies related to airport, in-flight, catering and services delivery.<br>
                    <br>
                    "Gulf Air needs to become a more customer service-driven carrier if it is to recapture its position as a world-class airline in the region. We must regain the same focus that once helped establish the airline as the chief innovator and standard setter for all passenger services," Hogan said on the new appointments.<br>
                    <br>
                    The other senior appointments include that of John Butler as Vice President of Sales and Marketing and Shane O'Hare as General Manager, Marketing. A seasoned airline professional with 25 years experience, Butler will be responsible for cultivating the airline's distribution strategy among the travel trade and corporate accounts for all countries. And O'Hare was previously the Director of Marketing and Brand Development for Star Alliance, the world's leading aviation alliance. His appointment will help Gulf Air implement brand development and marketing strategies, which has been missing till now. Another recent hire is Farid Alawi, head of the Network Division. He will be in charge of optimisation of schedules, utilisation of aircraft, yield management, and route profitability.<br>
                    <br>
                    "All these appointments are part of an effort to provide absolute customer satisfaction, and are indicative of the new direction the airline is embarking on," says Hogan. The company is also putting in place an executive graduate programme to train its future leaders.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Cutting costs</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="../../images/2002_august/Hogan.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Cost reduction is an integral part of Hogan's restructuring strategy. "We have to make sure that the airline's cost base is competitive. This would involve trimming the bureaucracy and eliminating other wastages by streamlining the network," says Hogan.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    According to the company officials, Gulf Air is planning to shed around 10 per cent of its 5,000-odd staff. For this, various schemes like early retirement and golden handshake are being considered. Already, 241 employees have left on an early retirement scheme. But Hogan may have to tread cautiously on this issue as job losses could attract criticism, especially since Gulf Air is a carrier owned by the governments. Nationalisation of jobs is a focus of the governments of Bahrain and Oman.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Besides, Hogan may have to face a talent problem. In any golden handshake or early retirement scheme, the best talents go out first as they can easily find other jobs. "Such schemes have the danger of losing many good people," says an airline executive. But Hogan insists, "The airline has to be fitter and leaner."<br>
                    <br>
                    Hogan also plans to look at increasing the route contribution. "We will lay a network plan focusing on the right connectivity and frequency. It's the network plan that drives the revenue," says he. Coupled with this is his focus on the passenger yield. "On a number of routes, our contribution is negative. And it's important for me to get the airline back to a positive position," he states.<br>
                    <br>
                    Gulf Air will also develop a fleet strategy linked with his network plan. This would help the airline acquire planes at much lesser cost on a long-term basis. "Aircraft are a big part of our cost. When we look at our fleet requirements for the next five or ten years, we will use our network plan as a negotiating tool with the plane manufacturers," says Hogan.<br>
                    <br>
                    It seems that he has no choice but to observe frugality. The cash-strapped airline has to depend on its promoters for any fund infusion and that is one of the reasons that Qatar has withdrawn from Gulf Air. In May 2001 too, all the four promoters chipped in with a total of US$159.2 million support hoping that the airline would return to making profits. But the airline slipped into an even bigger loss last year. In fact, to be fair to Gulf Air, no airline made money last year as a direct impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The global airline industry suffered a loss of US$11.9 billion in 2001-02.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    But Hogan hopes to get the required funds to finance his cash flow once he goes to the board in September with his plan. The promoters also seem to be committed to support, which is evident from the first tranche of US$81 million.<br>
                    <br>
                    But the real battle is to be played outside. And Hogan is preparing for that too. In June, the airline launched a price guarantee initiative to make sure that the airline is competitive on the ticket rates. It also launched a major advertising campaign in June announcing that it's back in business aggressively. Another promotional gimmick is the Gulf Air Electronic Frequent Flyer Programme (e-FFP), launched in June, which will allow Falcon frequent flyers to monitor their points and rewards online. Also, to cash in on vacation travel, it has started the Gulf Air Great Summer Escapes promotion with great deals on flights, hotels and car rentals.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    The challenge is to develop additional revenue streams, especially in a situation where the Gulf market is burdened with overcapacity. Marketing of destinations, by tying up with hotels, is a strategy to survive any downturn in the low-margin aviation business. And that has been successfully done by airlines like Emirates and Oman Air. For instance, the 'Magic of Muscat' programme of Oman Air was a big hit. Says Mohammed Mubarak Al Shikely, Senior Manager, Marketing, Oman Air, "We sold more than 2000 hotel room nights through that package."<br>
                    <br>
                    Gomes agrees, "Generating volumes is more than the sole remit of regional airlines. It requires an integrated effort to develop airport facilities, tourism infrastructure, international sporting events and similar movers of volume passengers."<br>
                    <br>
                    Tying up with hotels gives you the additional revenue, a good way to survive the downturns in aviation business, adds Edward Grauvogl, Director, Commercial and Strategic Planning, Oman Air.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    Hogan, too, is looking at tourism. All his plans for recapitalisation, segmented market approach, improved network and frequency, increased customer satisfaction, et al are designed to contribute to the growth of passenger volumes, both inbound and outbound. However, his specific schemes for tapping the tourism potential, like the details of his other strategies, will be revealed only when he makes his comprehensive presentation to the board in September this year.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the ultimate analysis, the airline is all set to take off with a new-look management and revamped operations. Despite Hogan's well-conceived policies for strategic rebuild, the airline's fortunes will remain subject to the numerous uncertainties afflicting the industry worldwide. Until then it remains to be seen how high the 'falcon' will fly for survival in the crowded skies.&nbsp;</font></p>

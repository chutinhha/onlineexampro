                  “There is a division between the parallel worlds of learning 
                  at home and learning in the classroom,” suggests Mohammed Al 
                  Maskari, KOM’s Director General. According to him, rows of 
                  students sitting in front of a whiteboard is outmoded for 
                  teaching and learning in the 21st century. Therefore 
                  technology is a prerequisite for teaching and learning in 
                  today’s schools.</font></p>

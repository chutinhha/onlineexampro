<b>Shell supports ICDL project</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im81.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="200" height="135">ICDL 
GCC Foundation, in association with Shell Representation Office Oman, has 
announced Shell’s support to the government’s initiative to adopt the 
International Computer Driving Licence (ICDL) program in the public education in 
the Sultanate, by sponsoring the testing and certification of 2,290 teachers in 
the ICDL program, in cooperation with Oman’s Ministry of Education and Ministry 
of National Economy. <br>
The agreement was signed by HE Mustafa bin Ali bin Abdul Lateef, Undersecretary, 
Finance and Administration, Oman Ministry of Education; Dr Andrew Wood, Shell 
country chairman and general manager – Shell Representation Office Oman; and 
Jamil Ezzo, director-general, ICDL GCC Foundation. This initiative is in line 
with the government’s directives to provide ICDL certification to all employees 
working in public, civil and military sectors in the Sultanate. <br>
Shell has allocated $150,000 (RO57,692) to fund the project, as part of its 
social activities program. This initiative aims to equip teachers in the 
sultanate with ICDL program that is considered as a benchmark recognised 
internationally to ascertain IT proficiency. This cooperation comes in support 
to the Ministry of Education’s project, which involves initially accrediting 360 
schools as training centres along with 12 schools as testing centres. The ICDL 
certification will be implemented to all the teachers working under the Oman 
Ministry of Education and it will be adopted to teach IT to over 50,000 public 
school eleventh graders every year.</font></p>

<b>Have mobile? Take a rain check!</b><br>
<img border="0" src="im85.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="194">In what is the first such service in the region, Oman’s Department of 
Meteorology has launched a new service for distributing weather information 
using the latest technology. The new service can be accessed from mobile devices 
using SMS messages or browsing through GSM (WAP). A user can obtain hourly 
weather observation or the next 24-hour forecast for any weather station from 
Oman meteorological stations any time round-the-clock in both Arabic and 
English. <br>
For quick and easy access to the latest recorded weather information of a 
station, the user may request or send a short massage to the number (90023) by 
typing the name of the station; e.g., Nizwa, or two alphabetical letters code 
(NZ). To request the next 24-hour forecast, a user should add letter code (FOR) 
in front of the name of the station (FOR Nizwa) or using the two alphabetical 
letters (FOR NZ). </font></p>

<b>Click, upload, win</b><br>
Global and regional digital leader LG Electronics has launched an online 
photography competition for residents in Oman, Qatar, the UAE and Bahrain. 
Registered members can host their digital pictures/scanned photographs on the 
Website (www.lgphotoclub.com) as well as vote for the best pictures. Visitors to 
the Website too can vote for the best photographs in the image gallery. Every 
registered user can vote for images in the various categories once a month and 
the pictures that get the maximum votes in each category every month win prizes 
sponsored by LG.<br>
“A user can increase (his/her) chances of winning by uploading more images. You 
can upload up to two images per category every month and then invite friends and 
family to vote for them. We have launched this competition in response to the 
increased interest in digital photography as part of our ongoing commitment to 
deliver high-quality, innovative products and services,” said K.H. Kim, 
president, LG Electronics Middle East &amp; Africa Operations. “LG will continue to 
introduce new industry technologies that will both captivate consumers and drive 
growth,” he added.<br>
The Website is a free service that provides users with the tools to store their 
personal digital photos and create virtual photo albums. Users are provided free 
storage space to store their favourite photos with specific restrictions on the 
size of each individual image. “There is unprecedented interest in the area of 
digital photography and photo printing over the last few years in the Middle 
East. People are changing the way they take and share their photographs; today, 
they utilise digital cameras and instant printing and sharing of photos via home 
PCs and the Internet. We wanted to keep pace with the regional market that 
demands the latest in value-added services and technology,” said Kim. </font></p>

<b>Bahrain simplifies immigration process with e-visa </b><br>
<img border="0" src="im82.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="200" height="155">Streamlined visa processes in Arabia are essential to stimulate visitor figures, 
according to one government tourism official, who said that online visa 
application facilities have proved highly successful since their recent 
introduction. Bader Nasser, head of marketing for tourism affairs for the 
government of Bahrain, highlighted the Kingdom’s e-visa initiative as a 
“necessary measure” if the drive for fast and seamless immigration processes for 
business and leisure travellers is to be met.<br>
The Bahrain e-visa project—a first for the Middle East and one of only a handful 
in the world—comes as the topic of visa restrictions comes under the spotlight 
at the first-ever Arabian Hotel Investment Conference, to be held in Dubai on 
April 30 – May 2, 2005. Bahrain was the first country in the Middle East and one 
of the only countries in the world to issue online visit visas to simplify—and 
‘fast track’—its immigration processes. To date, an average of 1,500 visas are 
downloaded a month, with numbers expected to double during the next 12 months. 
The e-visa initiative is the first phase of a drive to move all of Bahrain’s 
immigration processes online. Nasser said: “For too long, the issue of visas in 
Arabia has blighted the attempts of the tourism authorities especially to 
stimulate visitor numbers. We are pioneering the switch to e-visas as part of 
our strategy to become a tourism destination of the future.”<br>
Residents of 33 countries outside the GCC can apply online at www.evisa.gov.bh, 
allowing them to download their visit visa anywhere in the world before 
travelling to the Kingdom. Those able to take advantage of these facilities 
include UK, US, Australia and European passport-holders. Nasser said: “While the 
ideal scenario is still a single visa for Arabia for travel between the Gulf 
states, we have to look at new ways to make the immigration process as simple as 
possible for visitors.”</font></p>

<b>Cellucom launches first showroom in Kuwait</b><br>
Cellucom, one of the premier distributors of mobile communication devices and 
accessories in the Middle East, opened its first showroom in Kuwait last month. 
The new showroom is located at the Saha Complex at Salem Al Mubarak Street, 
Salmiya. The launch is part of Cellucom’s plans to expand its operations further 
into the GCC region. The company already has a network of high-end communication 
stores in UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.<br>
Arun Nagar, managing director, Cellucom, said: “We are extremely proud to launch 
our operations in Kuwait. The country has one of the Arab World’s most advanced 
telecommunications markets and the mobile phone market in Kuwait has been 
witnessing significant growth in recent years. Revenues from cellular 
connections were more than double the revenues from Public Switched Telephone 
Network in 2003. This provides Cellucom an excellent footing into a lucrative 
market and strengthens our operation in the region.”<br>
The telecommunication penetration rate in Kuwait in 2004 has risen to more than 
80 per cent. According to projections, Kuwait’s cellular subscriber base is 
expected to witness 5 per cent growth between 2003 and 2008 to reach around 2.17 
million subscribers by end-2008. Mobile phone revenues are projected to touch 
the $1 billion (RO384.62 million)-mark in 2008.</font></p>

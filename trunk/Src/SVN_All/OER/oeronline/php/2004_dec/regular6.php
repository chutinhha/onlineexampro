            <img border="0" src="im95.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="197">Please 
            tell OER about your career path…<br>
            </b>I hold three professional qualifications, viz. Chartered 
            Accountant from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, 
            Costs &amp; Works Accountant from the Institute of Costs &amp; Works 
            Accountants, India, and Certified Public Accountant from the US. I 
            started my career in finance with a pharmaceuticals company called 
            Sandoz Group in India, 20 years ago. <br>
            I entered the insurance sector through an opportunity in January 
            1986 at Oman National Insurance Co. I joined as Assistant Internal 
            Auditor in January 1986 and, in 1987, took over as Head of Internal 
            Audit. The six years in Internal Audit at ONIC from 1986 to 1992 
            enabled me to gain in-depth knowledge of every functional area of 
            the sector. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, 40 per cent of Al 
            Ahlia Insurance Co. was controlled by ONIC. In view of Al Ahlia’s 
            deteriorating financial condition in early 1990s, I was required to 
            present a Revival Plan. Following the presentation, I was offered 
            the opportunity to move over to Al Ahlia to implement the plan. <br>
            I moved over to Al Ahlia as Financial Controller in April 1992. 
            Implementing the business plans to change the fortunes of the 
            company was a challenge that I was looking forward to. Thankfully, 
            with the direction and support provided by the board of directors 
            and commitment shown by my team, the corrective measures started 
            yielding results and the company was back to its dividend paying 
            track record from 1993.<br>
            The board of directors recognised the performance and elevated me to 
            the position of assistant general manager (Finance). Subsequently, 
            in 2000, following the restructuring of the organisational 
            hierarchy, the board required me to assume responsibilities for 
            operational areas in addition to finance functions. The early 
            opportunity in my insurance career to study the operational areas in 
            depth as part of the audit function provided me with a solid 
            foundation in the technical areas. This was extremely helpful when I 
            moved into the line function in 1992. <br>
            In insurance, the combination of professional qualification in 
            finance and in depth work experience in technical areas is 
            invaluable. A combination of financial qualifications, knowledge of 
            technical areas, knowledge of local market, closeness to the clients 
            and intermediaries, rapport with international re-insurers and 
            corporate management skills convinced the board to offer me the 
            opportunity to lead the company. After an initial period as acting 
            general manager, I was formally designated as general manager in 
            September 2002. Al Ahlia’s premium has grown from around RO5 million 
            in 2001 to close to RO15 million, and profits have increased from 
            around RO300,000 to around RO2 million.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Please enlighten us about the management structure at Al Ahlia 
            Insurance…</b><br>
            At Al Ahlia, we have a close-knit management team with clearly 
            defined authority levels. The company believes in delegating 
            authority level commensurate with the operational requirements and 
            complement the same with a good reporting system. There are two 
            assistant general managers to support the general manager. The 
            company has a customer-centric organisation structure. To avoid 
            conflict of interest, the business centres are broadly structured as 
            Direct Insurance Department and Agencies &amp; Brokers Department. 
            Within these departments, there are assistant managers and account 
            executives that have been assigned specific client locations. The 
            clients, agents and brokers, therefore, have a single contact point 
            for all their requirements.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What does your role in the company entail?<br>
            </b>Although, initially I had to involve myself intimately with the 
            operations due to the nature of the markets and business situations, 
            with the growth in the volume and drawing up of procedures, we have 
            now achieved a significant level of delegation of operational 
            matters. Today, my role mainly entails drawing up business 
            strategies and plans, overall direction of the business operations, 
            development of new client relations, development of reinsurance 
            network and guidance to the team on exception areas, driving the 
            plans for training and continuing professional development of our 
            employees.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How long have you been in Oman, and how different is it from 
            handling operations in India? </b><br>
            I have been in Oman for close to 19 years. I come from Mumbai in 
            India. Relative to Mumbai, the size of operations is much smaller. 
            Professionally, the major attraction in Oman is that despite being a 
            relatively smaller world, it has all the challenges and complexities 
            that one could find in a larger environment. The exposure to these 
            diverse facets of operations that one can gain in a smaller 
            environment will not be available in a larger environment as in 
            India. To be successful, one needs to have the ability to wear 
            multiple hats at the same time and react speedily to the various 
            complex situations and challenges that the dynamic business 
            environment throws up.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Briefly describe your management style.</b><br>
            I believe in the consultative management style while at the same 
            time being decisive. I have absolute faith in my management team and 
            staff and believe in having their participation in the 
            decision-making process. <br>
            <br>
            <b>How is the insurance sector shaping up in Oman?</b><br>
            Oman has always remained a highly competitive market in view of the 
            number of players relative to the size of the market. Due to the low 
            annual growth rate of market premium and due to the annual cycle of 
            business placements, competition among the local players will 
            continue to remain heated. <br>
            Recent events—both locally and internationally—have resulted in a 
            review of the insurance regulations and business practices of 
            companies in Oman. The shifting of the Insurance Department from the 
            Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry to the Capital Market Authority 
            (CMA) is intended to achieve closer monitoring by the CMA and 
            implementation of the best practices in the insurance sector. The 
            increase in earning levels of individuals, higher savings propensity 
            and higher insurance awareness holds the potential for growth in 
            retail insurance products. With the Central Bank of Oman approving 
            Bancassurance as an activity for the banking sector, the banks will 
            emerge as a major intermediary in the sector.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What’s your take on spiralling global oil prices? Do you think 
            such high prices are sustainable in the long run?</b><br>
            Considering the projections of analysts on the outlook of the major 
            oil consuming economies and other political and economic factors, it 
            is unlikely that the current oil prices will be sustained in the 
            long run.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How do you de-stress yourself after a demanding day’s work?</b><br>
            Music is my passion and, to me, is the best form of stress reliever. 
            Having been active in sports in my younger days, the occasional 
            break during the weekend for a game of tennis also provides a 
            welcome diversion.<br>
            <br>
            <b>When recruiting new staff, what talent or qualities would you 
            seek?</b><br>
            The person I’d hire should be a team player and possess analytical 
            and proactive skills, should be a quick and willing learner, and 
            adapt to demanding situations. Good presentation skill-sets are a 
            must along with a sense of accountability, pride in performance, 
            fire in the belly, sense of urgency in completion of tasks and 
            ability to keep pace in a fast race. </font></p>

                    annual World Travel Market (WTM) is one of the biggest 
                    travel and tourist exhibitions in the world. WTM celebrated 
                    its 25th anniversary with this year’s exhibition at the 
                    Excel Exhibition Centre in Docklands, London (UK) from 
                    November 8–11, when over 5,000 leading suppliers and 44,000 
                    industry professionals from over 190 countries were 
                    represented at the industry’s premier business-to-business 
                    forum. <br>
                    WTM 2004 has been rated the best ever with a record number 
                    of trade professionals attending the four-day event. 
                    Overseas visitors jumped by 11 per cent year on year, and 
                    this year saw the biggest ever numbers of travel journalists 
                    and media operators present to report news from the event. 
                    If feedback from exhibitors is any indication, markets 
                    across the globe are reporting an increase in business after 
                    three very difficult years after 9/11. ‘‘There is a definite 
                    increase in confidence after three difficult years for the 
                    industry,’’ said Fiona Jeffrey, group exhibition director of 
                    Reed Travel Exhibitions, the organisers of the event.<br>
                    Tourist attractions from across the globe were displaying 
                    their offerings to the travel trade. Big names such as the 
                    Tussauds Group and Universal Studios exhibited alongside 
                    lesser-known attractions such as Brupark Mini-Europe in 
                    Brussels and El Querandi tango club in Buenos Aires. Disney 
                    had a major presence at WTM with a large stand aiming to 
                    raise the profile of its loss-making French theme park, 
                    Disneyland Paris.<br>
                    The change in the travel industry’s fortunes is thought to 
                    be behind the rush of new ‘names’ exhibiting at WTM for the 
                    first this year. The central Asia republic of Uzbekistan 
                    sent representatives following a decision by the government 
                    to put the destination firmly on the tourist map. Uzbek tour 
                    operators unveiled a marketing plan to promote the theme of 
                    the Great Silk Road, arid dismissed UK and US government 
                    warning that visits to the country were ‘high risk.’<br>
                    The State Department of Tourism of another former Soviet 
                    republic, Georgia, also had its own WTM stand for the first 
                    time Balkan holidays, and the states of former Yugoslavia 
                    including Serbia and Croatia were well represented and 
                    report a good level of business.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Middle East presence</b><br>
                    Despite the negative image of the Middle East caused by 
                    recent political developments, Arab countries with stands at 
                    this year’s World Travel Market in London were optimistic 
                    about the future of tourism. Major plans are being made to 
                    develop the industry and the focus on eco-tourism is 
                    increasing. While some countries are trying to raise the 
                    number of visitors, others are concentrating on the regional 
                    rather than the international market. In all, there were 
                    more than 250 organisations/institutes from the Middle East 
                    in WTM 2004. <br>
                    The Sultanate, represented by the newly formed Ministry of 
                    Tourism, participated in the WTM exhibition in full 
                    strength. A number of Omani companies took part in the 
                    four-day fair. These companies, which represented hotel and 
                    travel &amp; tourism sector in the Sultanate, included Oman Air, 
                    The Chedi Muscat, Grand Hyatt, the Shanghrila group, Hilton 
                    Salalah, InterCon &amp; Al Bustan Palace Hotels, promoters of 
                    The Wave project, Bahwan Tours, Oman Tours &amp; Travel, Khasab 
                    Tours, Mark Tours, National Tours &amp; Travel, Mazoon Travel 
                    and Zubair Travel. The fair provided the Omani companies an 
                    opportunity to meet with their counterparts in other 
                    countries and to promote the Sultanate’s tourism potentials.<br>
                    This was the 16th consecutive year for Oman’s participation 
                    in this grand annual fete. According to Aisha Althnwi, head 
                    of marketing at the Ministry of Tourism, she has seen the 
                    Omani stall grow from 50 sq m to 150 sq m in the six years 
                    that she has been part of the Oman contingent. Regarding the 
                    rationale behind attending such a fair, she said that 
                    ‘‘there has been a definite increase in the arrival of 
                    tourists from the UK in the recent past,’’ with the number 
                    of arrivals from London (UK) trailing only Berlin (Germany).
                    <br>
                    One of the newest attractions promoted at the WTM this year 
                    was Dubailand, a theme park with white-knuckle rides, 
                    tropical bio-domes and ski slopes in the Arabian sands of 
                    Dubai (UAE), due to open in 2006. The presence of Middle 
                    Eastern states has been increasing over the years. Among the 
                    other countries present in the exhibition, notable were 
                    Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, 
                    North Cyprus, Palestine, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.<br>
                    The state tourist board of Libya and the Markaz Tour and 
                    Travel Agency from Iran attracted a good deal of curious 
                    interest from tourism buyers exploring the WTM. Gulf Air won 
                    the Best Stand Design award for what the judges said was 
                    excellent use of space utilising the airline’s strong blue 
                    and gold branding (see Gulf Air Does Middle East Proud).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tourism bounces back</b><br>
                    According to data compiled by the World Tourism Organisation 
                    (WTO) for the first eight months of 2004, travel and tourism 
                    demand has bounced back strongly this year. In 2003, demand 
                    for travel and tourism was hit by the combined impacts of 
                    the Iraq war, the continued threat of terrorist attacks, 
                    economic uncertainties and the SARS epidemic. As a result, 
                    while some regions of the world showed positive growth over 
                    the full 12 months of 2003—and demand picked up in the last 
                    quarter—this was not enough to prevent a global downturn in 
                    international arrivals of 1.5 per cent to 691 million.<br>
                    Despite continued terrorist attacks and widespread threats 
                    to both safety/security and health, the long-awaited 
                    economic recovery has boosted consumer confidence. Combined 
                    with pent-up demand for travel and tourism, this resulted in 
                    a 12 per cent rise in international tourist arrivals 
                    worldwide in the first eight months of 2004, to around 526 
                    million. Fear has clearly turned into relative indifference 
                    in most major tourism source markets as people become more 
                    accustomed to living with risk.<br>
                    All regions of the world have benefited from the growth 
                    trend this year, with Asia Pacific (up 37 per cent to 99 
                    million international arrivals) recording the most 
                    impressive growth – albeit over very depressed levels during 
                    the same period in 2003. The Middle East has also been a 
                    strong performer (up 24 per cent to 23 million), thanks in 
                    large part to continued strong growth in intra-regional 
                    tourism demand and to a stellar performance by Egypt. And 
                    Africa’s arrivals rose by 9 per cent to 2 million, with 
                    double-digit growth in Morocco and Tunisia leading the 
                    recovery.<br>
                    The Americas recorded 12 per cent growth overall to 85 
                    million. North America’s increase (11.8 per cent) is 
                    attributed to healthy increases in all three countries of 
                    the region over the first 7-8 months of the year – the USA 
                    (15 per cent), Canada (9 per cent) and Mexico (14 per cent). 
                    Meanwhile, the three other American sub-regions—the 
                    Caribbean, Central and South America—maintained their 
                    positive performances of last year. <br>
                    Europe’s inbound growth, of 6 per cent to 296 million 
                    arrivals in the first eight months of this year, was 
                    comparatively modest. However, it was by no means 
                    disappointing given that it is the world’s most mature 
                    tourism destination, still attracting more than 56 per cent 
                    of international arrivals worldwide.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Air and oil don’t mix</b><br>
                    Data from both the International Civil Aviation Organisation 
                    (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) 
                    reflects the strong revival in demand for air transport 
                    worldwide this year. ICAO’s latest estimates project a 6.2 
                    per cent increase for the full 12 months of 2004—expressed 
                    in revenue passenger-km (RPK)—followed by a further 5.4 per 
                    cent rise in 2005.<br>
                    As a result of the sharp increase in the price of aviation 
                    fuel, IATA now expects losses for its member airlines to 
                    exceed the $3-$4 billion forecast a few months ago for 2004. 
                    The actual loss could well approach $5 billion. This 
                    disappointing result, which compares with a targeted $3.3 
                    billion profit forecast made in early 2004, is attributed 
                    almost entirely to rising fuel costs.<br>
                    According to IATA, every additional $0.01 increase in the 
                    price of jet fuel adds over $500 million in industry costs. 
                    And industry costs are currently running at $10 billion over 
                    2003’s level. Given that fuel represents a relatively modest 
                    8-12 per cent of total operating costs on short-haul 
                    flights—as against about 25 per cent on long-haul 
                    services—low-cost carriers (LCCs) have clearly been less 
                    affected by the rise in oil prices. This perhaps helps to 
                    explain why Ryanair is ready to promise that it will not 
                    impose fuel surcharges.<br>
                    At the same time, as the aviation experts at the Pisa Forum 
                    this year pointed out, it is also important to put the whole 
                    question of oil and fuel prices into perspective. Thanks to 
                    increasingly fuel-efficient aircraft, the growth in demand 
                    for aviation fuel has lagged far behind air passenger and 
                    freight growth. So the industry is—in theory, at least—less 
                    vulnerable to oil shocks.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Future prospects</b><br>
                    Demand for outbound travel closely follows exchange rate 
                    shifts, albeit with a certain time lag. The strong euro, 
                    which is expected to appreciate further over the next 3-4 
                    years, will have a significant impact on the choice of 
                    destinations and type of holidays for travellers from all 
                    key markets.<br>
                    Americans, for example, will be more likely to favour the 
                    Caribbean and Asia than EU Europe, and EU residents will 
                    probably prefer to travel outside the eurozone. At the same 
                    time, increased price transparency as a result of the 
                    widespread adoption of the euro in EU Europe will put 
                    additional pressure on suppliers to maintain rates and to 
                    provide a more level playing field.<br>
                    While price factors will continue to dominate tourism demand 
                    and supply, socio-economic factors should not be 
                    underestimated. Although the global economic recovery looks 
                    sustainable, it is uneven, and prospects for outbound travel 
                    vary significantly from one region and market to another. n<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Gulf Air Does Middle East Proud</b><br>
                    Gulf Air, owned by the Kingdom of Bahrain, Oman and the 
                    Emirate of Abu Dhabi, bagged the honours at WTM by winning 
                    the prestigious award for Best Stand Design. The award is 
                    the premier category for exhibitor awards at World Travel 
                    Market. The highlight of the stand was the first unveiling 
                    in Europe of Gulf Air’s new first and business class seats, 
                    as well as displays on Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Oman and 
                    information on the airline’s sponsorship of the 2005 Gulf 
                    Air Bahrain Grand Prix. <br>
                    With more than 5,000 exhibitors at World Travel Market, 
                    including more than 80 airlines, Gulf Air was up against 
                    stiff competition. But the clean, elegant lines of the 
                    stand’s design—created by Visual Communications’ Ross Brown 
                    and his Bahrain-based team—coupled with the hospitality 
                    delivered by Gulf Air cabin crew, sky chefs and sky nannies, 
                    made it first choice for the judges.<br>
                    Danny Barranger, worldwide head of sales, and Rohan Alce, 
                    general manager for UK, accepted the award on behalf of Gulf 
                    Air at a ceremony on the stand. James Hogan, chief executive 
                    and president of Gulf Air, told OER that the stand signified 
                    Gulf Air’s work ethos – work smarter. ‘‘Our stand has been 
                    made at 1/8th the cost of what some of the other 
                    participating airlines have invested in their stands here,’’ 
                    he revealed. <br>
                    “At Gulf Air, we strive for excellence in every area of our 
                    business performance. We’re delighted to have been 
                    recognised for the quality of the design of the stand – and 
                    it is certainly helping to attract a record number of 
                    visitors,’’ he added. <br>
                    Speaking on the opening of WTM, Hogan reported that despite 
                    high fuel costs, the airline was in good shape following 
                    strong growth in traffic and revenue during 2004. “While we 
                    are cognisant of the challenges of the fuel price as we 
                    approach the new year, there is much to celebrate at Gulf 
                    Air as 2004 draws to a close,” he said. <br>
                    “This has been an exceptional year by anyone’s standards. 
                    The initiatives in Project Falcon—our turnaround programme 
                    commenced in January 2003—continue to bear fruit, with the 
                    result that today we are on a sound financial footing. Gulf 
                    Air is on track to report record passenger numbers and 
                    revenue for this year, while debt is at its lowest since 
                    1989. Like all airlines worldwide, the record fuel price is 
                    hitting us hard with costs amounting to BD35 million ($93 
                    million) over our budget forecast for the year, but it has 
                    not diminished our determination and resolve to break even 
                    for the year.”<br>
                    The airline is in the second year of a three-year strategic 
                    recovery programme. Following the commencement of Project 
                    Falcon, other key performance indicators show growth in 
                    passenger traffic out of the three hubs of Abu Dhabi, 
                    Bahrain and Oman by 46 per cent, 36 per cent and 105 per 
                    cent respectively, while cargo revenue is up by 38 per cent 
                    and the seat factor by 3.8 points.<br>
                    However, with fuel costs presently running at 75 per cent 
                    over budget and an average fuel budget overrun of more than 
                    42.5 per cent for the year, he admitted there was a measure 
                    of disappointment in the fact that this would prevent the 
                    airline from recording a healthy profit.<br>
                    “While we are frustrated at not being in the black ahead of 
                    schedule, we recognise that rising fuel charges are just 
                    another hurdle to overcome and we will continue to look to 
                    the future and are constantly adjusting our business plan to 
                    manage the obstacles in our path to success.”<br>
                    Hogan pointed out that in recent weeks, some of the major 
                    names in the aviation industry as well as IATA had posted 
                    warnings about the negative impact the exceptionally high 
                    fuel prices would have on their respective businesses.<br>
                    “We continue to revisit our business plan and restructure,” 
                    he continued. “We will dispose of non-core assets and at the 
                    same time make the business decisions required to ensure 
                    that we adhere to our mandate to run Gulf Air on a 
                    commercial basis.”<br>
                    He added that investment in the Gulf Air brand, in its 
                    people, services and equipment will continue unabated, and 
                    as such the $10 million (RO3.85 million) investment in new 
                    first and business seats is on schedule for roll out in 
                    February 2005. <br>
                    “We will come through 2004, bruised but not bloodied thanks 
                    to the changes we have made over the past two years,” says 
                    Hogan. “However, 2005 presents a totally new proposition. If 
                    fuel prices stay at the exceptionally high levels we have 
                    seen in 2004, we will have to consider additional measures 
                    to counter the cost overrun.”<br>
                    Urging responsible competitive practices, which are key to a 
                    sustainable healthy industry, he said the regions’ airlines 
                    should act collectively in the introduction and sustained 
                    implementation of a suitable fuel surcharge, which would 
                    allow airlines to weather the storm.</font></p>

<img border="0" src="im32.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" width="200" height="150"></b>Gulf Air, owned by the Kingdom of Bahrain, Oman 
and the
Emirate of Abu Dhabi, bagged the honours at WTM by winning
the prestigious award for Best Stand Design. The award
is the premier category for exhibitor awards at World Travel
Market. The highlight of the stand was the first unveiling in
Europe of Gulf Air’s new first and business class seats, as well
as displays on Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Oman and information
on the airline’s sponsorship of the 2005 Gulf Air Bahrain
Grand Prix.
<br>
With more than 5,000 exhibitors at World Travel Market,
including more than 80 airlines, Gulf Air was up against stiff
competition. But the clean, elegant lines of the stand’s
design—created by Visual Communications’ Ross Brown and
his Bahrain-based team—coupled with the hospitality delivered
by Gulf Air cabin crew, sky chefs and sky nannies, made
it first choice for the judges.
<br>
Danny Barranger, worldwide head of sales, and Rohan
Alce, general manager for UK, accepted the award on behalf of
Gulf Air at a ceremony on the stand. James Hogan, chief executive
and president of Gulf Air, told OER that the stand signified
Gulf Air’s work ethos – work smarter. ‘‘Our stand has been
made at 1/8th the cost of what some of the other participating
airlines have invested in their stands here,’’ he revealed.
<br>
“At Gulf Air, we strive for excellence in every area of our
business performance. We’re delighted to have been recognised
for the quality of the design of the stand – and it is certainly
helping to attract a record number of visitors,’’ he added.<br>

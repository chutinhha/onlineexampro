            </b>Few things in life are as satisfying as creating something that 
            you—and your friends and co-workers—will admire. Applying creativity 
            to your computer system can also be very satisfying and rewarding. 
            To start designing your own custom gaming PC, you need to make a few 
            basic decisions. Like the configuration of the CPU, motherboard and 
            system RAM. Once that is taken care of, you’ll need gaming 
            accessories. OER delves into the innards of the global gaming zone 
            and fishes out the best available gaming accessories</font></p>

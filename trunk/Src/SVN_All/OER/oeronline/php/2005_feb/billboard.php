                    has launched its latest MPV model in Oman, the new Touran. 
                    Germany's most popular MPV since its market launch in March 
                    2003, the Touran has seven separate seats and is a totally 
                    new development, boasting a new body, interior, running gear 
                    and many driveline elements too. Among the most important 
                    features of this new Volkswagen are its versatile interior 
                    layout and the exceptional amount of space it provides, with 
                    a load area that can be as large as 1,989 litres.<br>
                    <br>
                    With the Touran, Volkswagen has created an MPV that sets new 
                    quality standards in its market segment. This claim is one 
                    of the principal aspects that set the Touran apart from its 
                    rivals. Inside the Touran, practical versatility and 
                    built-in safety features are evidence that it has been 
                    designed to match the needs of customers with high mobility 
                    demands. <br>
                    Driving enthusiasts in search of excitement can look forward 
                    to the New Volkswagen Golf GTI in Oman to be launched by 
                    Wattayah Motors.<br>
                    <br>
                    Volkswagen will also soon launch the new Golf GTI which will 
                    be available in 2.0-litre Turbo FSI petrol engine that 
                    delivers 147KW/ 200hp and races to 235km/h. The New Golf GTI 
                    also boasts of an improved exterior and interior look. For 
                    the first time in the almost 30-year history of the GTI, the 
                    nose has been designed differently compared to other Golf 
                    models as it has its own radiator grille design. The model 
                    now has a defined GTI nose. The all-new GTI seats provide a 
                    high-level of comfort with very good side support and a 
                    sporty look. And for the first time the customers in Oman 
                    can customize the new Golf GTI according to their

                    tailored/customized programs for medium to large

                    current management knowledge and skills to working 
                    executives. Executive programs are short in duration, highly

                    consultancy and original research experience. <br>
                    <br>
                    These programs will include a wide range of topics in the 
                    areas of general management, change management, strategy,

<b>By successfully hosting the 15th Asian Games, the second largest sports 
extravaganza after the Olympics, Qatar has sent a clear signal that it is ready 
to expand its connections with the world, finds out Clarence Michael<br>
</b><br>
QATAR has achieved what was considered to be near impossible for a Gulf country. 
Having spent more than US$2.8-billion, the peninsula state is hosting over 
15,000 athletes and officials from 45 countries, 5,000 members of the media and 
an additional 10,000 spectators at the 15th Asian Games being held in Doha from 
December 1. It was no easy task. But, with both the Government and the private 
sector joining hands in a unique public-private initiative, Qatar has emerged 
successful in the race to build new stadiums and put the necessary 
infrastructure into place. The near-perfect preparations were all executed with 
a clear ambition: Qatar will in the near future host the largest multi-sport 
event, the Summer Olympics.<br>
<br>
Take, for example, the 15th Asian Games Temporary Terminal at the Doha 
International Airport commissioned by the Doha Asian Games Organising Committee 
(DAGOC). Located in a secure thematic structure, it was designed to reflect an 
Arabian tent that is capable of handling a flow of 2,300 passengers per hour. 
The terminal, which will be dismantled after the Games, is just one segment of a 
multi-faceted plan that Qatar had put in place to host the Asian Games.<br>
<br>
“The existing Doha International Airport terminals will continue to serve 
passengers arriving on all international flights, while the temporary terminal 
will be used exclusively for all accredited athletes, officials, media and 
guests,” according to Abdulla K Al Qahtani of the Doha International Airport.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, the response to the Government initiatives has been enormous. 
The tickets for the Opening Ceremony for Doha 2006 were oversold by 72 per cent 
in the first two phases, requiring DAGOC to launch a final phase. Special 
seating arrangements have been made for families and an eight-ticket limit per 
buyer imposed for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies by the DAGOC.<br>
<br>
In the Games Village, there are a total of 32 residential buildings with 811 
apartments for athletes. Each athlete or team official apartment consists of 
five bedrooms and houses a maximum of 13 athletes. All apartments have access to 
a common living room, with television, telephone and refrigerator, and there are 
four bathrooms in each apartment. Similarly, the Chefs de Mission officials are 
being accommodated in 45 apartments while there will be 45 NOC Offices.<br>
<br>
But what price will this infrastructure be worth in the future? Well, it looks 
like the Qataris are set to reap long-term benefits from the new facilities. 
Qatar is already riding on an economic boom, capitalising on its massive gas 
reserves. Today, Qatari per capita income at US$26,000 ranks as one of the 
highest in the world. Both commercial and residential real estate markets are 
also tracking these trends, with projects like The Pearl-Qatar and the 
US$5-billion Lusail project by Qatari Diar, reflecting the increased economic 
interest that the country is generating. <br>
<b> <br>
Partners at Work</b><br>
Among the multinationals that have helped Qatar lay the infrastructure for the 
Doha Games is GE. The company has signed a strategic agreement with the DAGOC to 
be an Official Partner and to provide temporary power generation for 
approximately 40 competition and non-competition venues around Doha.</font></p>

No major game can be a success without state-of-the-art communication 
facilities. Qtel is a Prestige Partner for the Games and its Official 
Telecommunications Provider. It is providing a wide range of services, including 
local and international telephony, Internet and data services and cable 
television, during the Games. This apart, Qtel will provide up to 13 TV channels 
for the pilot project during and after the Games, including sport, entertainment 
and TV news channels from broadcasters such as Al Jazeera, CNN, CNBC and others.
<br>
<br>
In total, Qtel has invested QR500 million (approx. US$138 million) in new 
technologies, including a state-of-the-art high-speed optical capacity network 
that is capable of delivering high definition television (HDTV) coverage of the 
Games. This investment is certain to benefit Qatar’s citizens long into the 
future given the induction of these very advanced technologies, says Qtel.<br>
<br>
According to Qtel CEO, Dr. Nasser Marafih, “Whilst we here in Qatar are 
fortunate in that we can be present at the Games in the stadiums, there will be 
millions and millions of people around the world glued to their television sets, 
cheering on their national heroes and national teams. This has been made 
possible by Qtel in partnership with other carriers and operators to transmit 
high quality pictures and images around the globe.”<br>
<br>
Qtel’s complement of payphones is now fully smart-card operated, avoiding the 
need for users to depend on having appropriate numbers of cumbersome coins to 
make calls. Besides, it has expanded the number of WiFi access points and 
introduced a new service called WiMax to provide a wider ‘footprint’ for 
wireless web access. Moreover, the pre-paid ‘Games Ebahar’ service for the press 
and media allows users to buy daily, weekly or games-duration cards that allows 
them WiFi Internet access at close to 300 access points in the Main Press 
Centre, the Athletes Village or any of the 26 Games venues around Doha.<br>
<br>
Says Dr. Nasser, “We have invested in technologies as well as in our people and 
after the Games are over, we will be left with a wonderful legacy that will 
continue to serve Qatar for years ahead.”<br>
<br>
According to Qatar National Bank, which is sponsoring the volunteer uniforms, 
this is part of QNB’s extensive promotional endorsement, in addition to its 
banking services’ support. As the QNB logo is emblazoned on the Doha 2006 
workforce dress, a beaming Ali Shareef Al Emadi, QNB’s Acting Chief Executive, 
said “When the Asian Games are over, these uniforms will become a memorabilia of 
the biggest sporting event in the history of Asia. We want the volunteers to 
look back at the Games as a special time in their lives and remember QNB’s role 
in making these Games a success.”<br>
<br>
Fifteen months ago, QNB signed the QR36.5 million (approx. US$10 million) 
sponsorship agreement with the DAGOC to became the official bank for the Games. 
The bank has constructed temporary branches within the Asian Games City, the 
temporary airport and the main media centre. <br>
<b> <br>
Hosting the Delegations</b><br>
Hospitality leader, The Ritz-Carlton, Doha, hosted 20 major sports delegations 
in 2006, including those from Tour de Qatar, Moto GP, the Qatar Masters and 
DAGOC. By the end of this year, this is expected to result in a minimum of 
14,000 room nights, with the Asian Games alone increasing average occupancy 
levels by 2 per cent of total room nights for 2006.</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
Samsung Electronics has been a sponsor of the Asian Games since 1986, and this 
year its partnership includes exclusivity in audio/visual, white goods and 
mobile phone categories.<br>
As an exclusive multi-category Prestige Partner, Samsung is providing 8,189 
products, consisting of 3,549 A/V (TV, Video Camera and DVD/VCR Combo), 2,772 
mobile phones, 1,868 household appliances (referigerators, washers and 
microwaves), for use in the Games’ venues, said Jong-Yong Yun, Vice Chairman and 
CEO of Samsung Electronics.<br>
<br>
Massive preparations apart, there have already been complaints from several 
countries about a shortage of accommodation for their athletes. The US$500 
million Athletes’ Village was built to house 10,000 people, but 13,500 
competitors and officials will now need accommodation. Officials indicated some 
countries have gone over their quotas and will have to make their own 
arrangements. <br>
<br>
However, the organisers say such criticism only overplays the issues. Games 
spokesman Ahmed Abdulla Al Khulaifi said, “In Qatar, there are 14,000 medical 
staff and only 8.5 per cent will be used for Asian Games services. There will be 
no effect on medical services for the country.” Similarly, Qatar National 
Olympic Committee secretary-general Sheikh Saoud bin Abdelrahman Al Thani said, 
“The rest of the world thought that Qatar, with only 200,000 nationals, could 
not organise the Asian Games, but we have proved them wrong.”<br>
As a recent Standard Chartered report notes: “…the wider growing pains are to 
some degree inevitable given the scale and ambitions of the projects and 
developments. However, increasing export volumes and continued investment will 
result in Qatar being the region’s fastest growing and richest economy.” <br>
<br>
In the ultimate analysis, for Qatar, which has the second-largest gas reserves 
in the world, this is once-in-a-lifetime chance to demonstrate to the world its 
huge redevelopment. Given the scale of Qatar’s ambitious projects, it appears 
that successful hosting of the Asian Games is part of the country’s larger plan 
to rally support for its expected bid to host the 2016 <br>
Olympics.</font></p>

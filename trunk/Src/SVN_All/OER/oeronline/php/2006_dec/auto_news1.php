        T</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">he ‘Shell Better Mileage 
        Challenge’, a unique competition that tested driving endurance and fuel 
        economy using Shell Better Mileage petrol created a buzz in Oman on 
        November 23, 2006. A total of 39 teams — each comprising two members — 
        representing various Ministries, corporates, media and leading 
        automobile dealers attempted to get the best mileage in their vehicles 
        using Shell Better Mileage petrol as they drove on an approx. 225 km 
        route starting from Muscat. <br>

        <img border="0" src="autonews5.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="123"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The 
        participants were flagged-off by HE Eng. Ahmed Bin Hassan Al-Dheeb, the 
        Undersecretary of Ministry of Commerce and Industry, from the Shell 
        Service Station at Al Ghubrah at 2 pm. Besides staff from Shell Oman and 
        other dignitaries, fuel economy enthusiasts Helen and John Taylor were 
        also present at the venue to give last minute tips to the participants 
        on how to achieve better mileage using simple techniques.<br>
        <br>
        Both Shell Super and Regular fuels in Oman are enhanced with the Better 
        Mileage formula offering customers the best value along with better 
        mileage and resultant cost savings, as Shell fuels come at no extra 
        cost. The Better Mileage formula is designed to also improve engine 
        efficiency and reduce emissions, thereby, having a positive effect on 
        the environment. “With the launch of the Better Mileage Formula in Shell 
        petrol, Shell is committed to help its customers get the most out of 
        their fuel, at no extra cost. The Better Mileage Challenge is one such 
        endeavour to help everyday drivers experience the advantages of Shell 
        petrol and proven Fuel Economy tips as demonstrated by the Taylors,” 
        said Faisal Al Hashar, General Manager — Retail Sales and Operation, 
        Shell Oman Marketing Company SAOG. “At the same time we wanted the 
        contestants to also have some adventure and excitement in their quest of 
        the ultimate better mileage honours,” he added.<br>

        <img border="0" src="autonews6.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="123"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Besides 
        the serious task of getting the best mileage out of their vehicles, to 
        add a bit of fun to the Challenge, participants stopped at three 
        ‘mystery’ pit-stops where they performed various tasks involving mental 
        and physical challenges before reaching the finishing point. Clues were 
        provided for teams to reach each pit-stop.<br>
        <br>
        The contestants were divided in four different categories on the basis 
        of the engine capacity of their vehicles. The winners in various 
        categories were selected on the basis of the fuel efficiency and not on 
        the time taken to complete the Challenge. All the contestants returned 
        good mileage. The OER team represented by Akshay Bhatnagar and TR Vinod 
        driving Kia Rio 1.4 L manual transmission managed an outstanding average 
        of 20 kmpl. The winners in different categories were:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Category A (1600cc and below) – Victor and Jessint with 22.35 kmpl<br>
        Category B (1601cc to 2000cc) – Jasim Al Maharbi and Ahmed Al Oufi with 
        19.18 kmpl<br>
        Category C (2001cc and above) – Mohammed Hilal and Ahmed Hilal with 
        19.09 kmpl<br>
        Category D (4WD) – Shailesh and Bhawna with 15.04 kmpl<br>

              and Helen Taylor, the couple from Australia, have been obsessed 
              with breaking records. Between them, they hold 34 notable 
              achievements for driving economically. Early this year, they set a 
              new Guinness World Record for travelling round the world in 78 
              days, covering 25 countries and 28,970 km on just 1,303 litres of 
              Shell fuel, averaging 4.5 litres per 100 km. OER had a chat with 
              them on the sidelines of the Shell Better Mileage Challenge held 
              in Oman recently:<br>
              <b><br>
              What brings you to Oman?</b><br>
              Helen: We are here to educate the public about driving efficiently 
              to save fuel and maximize the mileage on the invitation from Shell 
              Oman. We have given fuel saving tips to the public through our 
              interaction at various public forums organised by Shell. We 
              encouraged the enthusiastic participants at the Shell Better 
              Mileage Challenge on November 23.<br>
              <b><br>
              How was your record breaking journey from Muscat to Salalah?</b><br>
              John: It was wonderful. As part of the Shell One Tank Challenge, 
              we drove from Muscat to Salalah on November 20. We covered a 
              distance of 1,029 km in Volkswagen Golf 1.6L manual transmission, 
              provided by Wattayah Motors. We managed a mileage of 21.44 km per 
              litre which is 55 per cent higher than the official manufacturer’s 
              figures. <br>
              <b><br>
              How you manage your kids as you are busy constantly in challenging 
              journeys?</b><br>
              Helen: They have also inherited our passion for fuel economy. We 
              have three children — Kate 24, Lyndal 21, and Clint, 18, and each 
              child has personally experienced a record breaking drive 
              first-hand in Europe, Indonesia and Australia. <br>
              <b><br>
              How you developed a passion for fuel economy?</b><br>
              Helen: I was born in a family where money was scarce. We didn’t 
              own a vehicle. The extent of our travels was an annual visit to an 
              aunt’s house once a year by taxi. This lack of opportunity made me 
              determined to drive. I studied and worked hard to get my own car. 
              It all started in 1991 when two of my friends approached me as 
              they were recruiting four drivers to take part in a Guinness World 
              Record around Britain fuel-economy attempt. Without hesitation, I 
              joined them and we set a new world record. I’m still going on…<br>
              <b><br>
              What about you John?</b><br>
              John: I like doing different things. My first record-breaking 
              endeavor was in 1979 when I undertook a 3,000 mile walk around 
              Europe to raise funds for a special needs project. I have 
              undertaken the John O’Groats to Lands End (an endurance race 
              through England, Wales and Scotland) a record 18 times, in the 
              form of walking, running, cycling and driving. I also ran a 3,000 
              mile relay race across the US. We run ‘Taylor Made’ coaching 
              schools in Australia and Singapore. In my spare time, I write for 
              a motoring magazine in Australia. For us, 10 hours a day in a car 
              is a delight. After years of immersion in the daily demands of 
              raising a family, we’ve finally got the chance to enjoy some 
              (record breaking) quality time together. We believe that if auto 
              drivers start following our tips it could lead to significant 
              energy saving in the world.</font></td>

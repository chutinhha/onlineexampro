Netherlands-based Royal Philips Electronics is one of the world’s biggest 
electronics companies and Europe’s largest, with sales of EUR 30.4 billion last 
year. As a global player in the three domains of healthcare, lifestyle and 
technology, it has been rated the top climber among the ‘Leading 50’ companies 
in corporate sustainability reporting published by Sustainability in partnership 
with the United Nations Environment Programme and S&amp;P. The company has recently 
made strategic moves to enter new market segment by agreeing to acquire Partners 
in Lighting (PLI), the leading European manufacturer of home luminaries, as well 
to acquire New York-headquartered Intermagnetics General Corp, which develops, 
manufactures and markets high-field superconducting magnets used in Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging. Moreover, as part of its aggressive marketing strategy, the 
company has unveiled its latest brand campaign, spanning TV, print, online and 
outdoor media in 10 markets around the world that includes China, France, 
Germany, U.K., U.S.A., Brazil, Russia, The Netherlands, Italy and India. OER 
caught up with Merkus to find out that Oman too occupies an important place for 
Philips’ market strategy in the Middle East.</font></p>

<b>When did Philips make its foray into the Middle East market?</b><br>
We entered the Middle East market some 50-60 years back.<br>
<b><br>
How do you perceive the growth trajectory of Philips domestic appliance and 
personal care segment in Middle East over these years?</b><br>
Huge investments are taking place in the region, which has become the hub of 
intense economic activity. These, in turn, have had a positive impact on 
consumer buying behaviour. We have a positive outlook about the growth of our 
company in this region. <br>
<b><br>
What are the future plans of the company in the Middle East?</b><br>
In the domestic appliances and personal care segments, the company has been 
regularly launching new products, several more of which are in the pipeline.<br>
<b><br>
Recently, Philips has been on acquisition drive, especially in the medical and 
lighting segments. Is there any acquisition move planned in the domestic 
appliances and health care segments, especially in the Middle East?</b><br>
We certainly have some very aggressive plans for the Middle East. But, I am 
afraid I cannot divulge when exactly this will happen.<br>
<b><br>
No Middle East country features in the latest brand campaign unveiled by Philips 
recently. Your comments?</b><br>
Philips is a global brand and we operate in a number of countries around the 
globe. Therefore, sometimes it becomes a difficult choice to prioritise among 
countries. But, all our brand campaigns are launched in a phased manner and the 
Middle East will certainly feature in time to come. <br>
<b><br>
How important is the Omani market for Philips products, especially domestic 
appliances and personal care?</b><br>
In Oman, there’s a growing demand for all Philips products. The company is 
looking forward to a future of greater importance based on Oman’s market. 
Consumers in Oman have placed considerable confidence in our products and we’re 
trying to further strengthen that confidence.</font></p>

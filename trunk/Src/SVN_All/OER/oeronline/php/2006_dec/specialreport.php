Middle East is one of the fastest growing ICT (information, communication and 
technology) markets in the world. According to international market research 
firm IDC, the Middle East ICT spend will hit a whopping US$16.8 billion by 
2010–up from just US$8.4 billion in 2005. The 2006 editions of GITEX (the 
premier Gulf Information Technology and Communication Exhibition) and GULFCOMMS 
(the Middle East’s largest International Telecom Event for Mobile, Fixed, IP and 
Satellite Technologies) held in Dubai from November 18-22 proved that global 
industry giants are looking at the Middle East market to drive their businesses</font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr" style="margin: 5 10"><font face="Verdana" size="1">One of the largest 
ICT events in the world, GITEX and GULFCOMMS 2006 occupied 13 halls and more 
than 62,000 sq. m. (33 per cent more than last year) at the DICEC complex. This 
year, there were 1,347 exhibitors (up 16 per cent) from 76 countries (up 23 per 
cent), with country groups from the US, Syria, Hungary and Portugal coming in 
for the first time. <br>
Sales during the event hit a record high of more than RO8.2 million, with over 
130,000 visitors from around the world. “This year’s event was the occasion for 
the announcement of many major launches and the conclusion of numerous business 
deals by the international IT and Telecom community. We are proud to play a part 
in contributing to the growth of the dynamic industry in this region,” said 
Dubai World Trade Centre Director-General, Helal Saeed Al Marri. <br>
<b><br>
Generation Next</b><br>
Most of the global and regional ICT giants made their presence felt by sparing 
no effort to attract the visitors. The big daddies such as Microsoft, Panasonic, 
Samsung, HP, Sony, Sharp, Lenovo, Cisco, Acer, Adobe, Canon, LG, i-mate, Epson, 
Fujitsu Siemens, Hitachi, IBM and Juniper Networks, etc., adopted aggressive 
marketing promotion strategies, ranging from colourful stalls, innovative 
displays, infotainment programmes to eye-popping freebies to woo the crowd. Many 
companies launched and showcased their new products for the first time in the 
Middle East. </font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr" style="margin: 5 10"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Samsung: Imagine the 
Possibilities: Samsung wowed the crowds in Hall 5 with a splendid selection of 
new audio-visual, IT and mobile products. Samsung’s massive stand covered almost 
700 sq. m. based on ‘imagine the possibilities’ theme, providing visitors with 
an insight into trends that will shape the future. Products on display included 
the latest plasma TVs, the first Blu-ray disc player for the Middle East market, 
the smallest laser printer in the world, a wide variety of products for mobile 
phones and an entirely new concept MP3 player. Samsung’s launch of SGH-P310, 
which comes with a newly designed exterior and a revamped abundance of features 
to be termed as the ‘Card Phone II’, attracted mobile enthusiasts. Samsung also 
introduced its latest innovative laptop models to the Middle East market for the 
first time. The notebook display focused on the SSD notebook PC and also the 
ultra mobile PC. The ultra mobile Samsung Q1 notebook weighs in at just 777g and 
features the latest touch screen technology.<br>

Intel: Quad-Core: A powerful solution to the challenge of faster processing has 
been made available by Intel in the form of multi-core technology and 
processors. It involves using several microprocessor execution cores 
concurrently so that tasks are shared and computer response times speeded up 
accomplishing numerous tasks faster. Earlier in January, the Intel Core Duo 
processor–based on dual-core technology–for mobile PCs was launched. The next 
leap is not far away–microprocessors using 4 execution cores (so called 
“quad-core”) are already under development and are scheduled for launch before 
the end of 2006.<br>
<br>
Intel is pioneering the use of multi-core processors in desktops and laptops. 
The impact of dual-core or multi-core processors is like having six or eight 
cylinders in your car engine rather than the typical four, or driving on a 
10-lane on a motorway rather than a six-lane one. The new processing technology 
delivers immense speed and responsiveness for general purpose servers, 
workstations, digital media creation, high-end gaming and other market segments 
that crave for performance. <br>
<br>
Sun: New Java Platform: Sun Microsystems offered an exclusive preview of the 
next major Java platform, known as Java SE6. It is designed to enable users to 
develop and deploy Java applications using their desktop servers, in addition to 
embedded and real-time environments. It promises to increase developer 
productivity in addition to enhanced management and serviceability by offering 
monitoring and management capabilities ‘out of the box’ to help users diagnose 
common Java SE problems. Sun also heavily promoted its successful Solaris 
Operating System, Sun Fire Server and Sun Ultra workstation ranges at GITEX.<br>

HD Camcorder: Canon, a leader in 
photographic and imaging technology, 
introduced the new HD camcorder XL H1: the next generation XL series video 
camcorder. The new model records HDV in 1080/50i to miniDV cassettes (MPEG-2 at 
25Mbps), using Canon’s new DIGIC DV II engine for HD processing. With a further 
progressive shooting mode (25f), the 1/3” 1.67 Megapixel 3CCD XL H1 boasts the 
highest resolution in the HDV class, as per Canon. Incorporating real 
professional connectivity, this new addition to the current X family of XL2 and 
XM2 camcorders is likely to become the tool of choice for production houses, 
studios and low-budget freelance moviemakers eager to make the transition to HD 
production. <br>

Sony Ericsson: Music, Imagining and Lifestyle: Sony Ericsson’s display 
highlighted its Walkman phones, digital imaging, or K series, mobile phones, the 
stylish Z series lifestyle phones and the penultimate business phone, the P990i. 
The company presented its newest Walkman music mobile phones, the W850i, W710i 
and the W950i. With the latest music capabilities, these mobile phones are as 
diverse a media tool as one can hope for. Sony Ericsson has made significant 
additions to the Walkman series. Both phones make music downloads and sharing 
faster and more convenient. </font></p>

<b>Giant Strides</b><br>
Taking the lead, the software giant Microsoft launched its much-anticipated 
Windows Vista, the 2007 Office System and Exchange Server 2007 in the region. 
Ali Faramaway, VP Microsoft Europe, Middle East and Africa said, “These products 
will help businesses overcome the challenges of our increasingly 
information-saturated world, enhancing the way people collaborate, communicate, 
protect and manage content, and find, use and share information.”<br>
<br>
Leading global software and technology solutions provider, Adobe Systems, also 
launched its award-winning Adobe Flex 2, a strong framework to rapidly develop 
applications for the majority of its user base.<br>
<br>
World leading solution providers like CA and SAP made key announcements at GITEX 
2006. CA announced its broad-based solutions for risk mitigation and compliance 
to enhance the built-in capabilities included in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007. 
Exclusive launches at the event were presented by industry majors, like i-mate 
which unveiled the i-mate JAQ3 for its global debut in the Middle East; and the 
new expanded Enterprise Application Solutions (EAS) offering by Epicor, which 
caters to retail, hospitality, services and manufacturing sectors.<br>
<br>
Sony showcased its Blu-ray high-definition (HD) format expecting that regional 
demand for it will be driven by the popularity of the much expected Playstation 
3 (PS3). The technology giant’s GCC managing director Masaru Tamagawa said, 
“Once people start playing Blu-ray disks on their PS3s, they will see how good 
the quality is and start buying the Blu-ray technology itself. Blu-ray 
technology and the PS3, which are already available in the US and Japan, will be 
launched in the Middle East in March 2007.” <br>
<br>
Epson Middle East showcased its range of consumer high definition products led 
by its impressive EMP range of home entertainment solutions. Most popular 
display was HD ready projector EMP-1715, which Epson claims is the world’s first 
XGA 3LCD projector with USB connectivity and multi-screen technology.<br>
<br>
HP, the Gold Sponsor for the event, presented a state-of-the-art interactive ‘HP 
Zone’ that showcased the smart home concept as well as a wide array of HP 
Lifestyle products. Network International, the region’s most leading card 
solutions provider, ran a credit card promotion with over 30,000 fabulous prizes 
including airline tickets, DVD players, memory sticks, laptops and plasmas.</font></p>

<b>Having a pan-Sultanate footprint within just 17 years of its inception, the 
Dhofar Insurance Company SAOG has come a long way and is bracing to face the

Rawni Khadr, VP (Development &amp; Marketing) Dhofar Insurance Company SAOG, about 
what defines the mission of his company and pat comes the reply, “The company’s 
social mission is to operate in a way that it actively recognises the central 
role business plays in society — by initiating innovative ways to improve the 
quality of life locally, nationally and internationally.” For the last 17 years, 
Dhofar Insurance Company SAOG has lived up to its mission by gradually expanding 
its footprints and venturing into a number of sectors. And the result is obvious 
— today it’s the largest insurer in the Sultanate, with total assets exceeding 
RO 30 million, a capital base of whopping RO 17,500,000 and the premium income 
reaching to a staggering RO37 million by 2005, grabbing over 50 per cent pie of 
the market premium segment. In fact, superlatives and Dhofar Insurance Company 
today make perfect bedfellows. Take a look — it has the largest capital base, 
largest reserves, largest premium turnover, largest number of employees, largest 
number of branches and has consistently paid out the largest number of claims in 
Oman. <br>
<b><br>
The Beginning</b><br>
For Dhofar Insurance having begun its sojourn in September 1989 as a joint stock 
company with an initial paid-up capital of RO 3,000,000 was akin to treading a 
risk-ridden path in an underdeveloped insurance market like that of Oman. But 
the company management and its shareholders dared to face the challenge head on. 
With 32 branches spreading all across the Sultanate, and three more in the 
pipeline, this insurance behemoth today provides insurance, re-insurance and 
underwriting services covering sectors such as power generation, chemical 
industry, mining operations, energy, oil &amp; petroleum, marine insurance, travel 
insurance, motor insurance, personal accident, employee insurance and 
construction insurance. Comments Taher Bin Taleb Kamal Al-Heraki, company’s CEO 
and director, on the company’s pan-Sultanate ubiquity, “Today the company is 
identified in every region of the country, right from the major cities and 
Wilayats to the remotest areas. A unique, round-the-clock service is available 
at all the Royal Oman Police border check posts on the UAE and Yemen borders.” 
In the last 17 years, the company has inked business partnerships with leading 
re-insurance companies in the US, Far East and MENA (Middle East and North 
Africa) regions that have helped it a lot in initiating re-insurance services 
and safeguarding its interests against a number of risks. Heraki believes these 
partnerships have contributed to increasing the company’s yields and meeting its 
financial obligations.<br>
<b><br>
Keeping Pace with the Times </b><br>
The fact that Oman’s insurance sector is undergoing transformation with new 
players entering the market in a more liberalised environment has not gone off 
the radar from Dhofar Insurance company’s strategies. As a counter shield to 
competition, the company has firmed up its capital base, like other national 
insurance companies to face the competition. Further, to keep pace with the 
times, the company keeps updating its services, developing its human resources 
to a new level and introducing the latest range of insurance services in the 
market. The company’s management claims it always conducts rigorous researches 
within the parameters of rules and regulations before taking any decision that 
affects its customers. As Heraki sums it up, “The company is committed to 
providing high quality insurance services against all the risks.”<br>
<b><br>
Employees Matter </b><br>
The company attributes the increase in its capital base as a direct result of 
bonus shares and increased investment and it has issued dividends every year 
since its incision. Even though the insurance penetration in Oman is relatively 
low at less than two per cent, the Dhofar Insurance managed to bag insurance 
premium income amounting to the staggering RO37 million by 2005, and is 
anticipating increase this year by 20 per cent. When asked to comment on this 
impressive growth, Rawni replied, “The company’s economic objective is to 
operate on a sustainable financial basis for profitable growth, increasing value 
for stakeholders and expanding opportunities for the development and career 
growth for its employees.”<br>
<br>
From the number of employees being seven in 1989 to 295 at present, the company 
has managed well on the Omanisation front too with Omanis constituting 75 per 
cent of the company’s workforce — even 100 per cent in some branches. Its 
successful Omanisation plan has earned it a good name in the GCC region and 
helped it capture a number of prestigious national and GGC awards in employing 
nationals. To this end, the company established a training centre to raise the 
skills and performance of its employees, Heraki adds. The company has also been 
honoured by His Majesty’s government for the third consecutive year for its 
Omanisation programme. “We are committed to providing a healthy milieu for our 
employees and encouraging them to provide professional service to our 
customers,” Khadr adds.<br>
<br>
He further claims, “We believe that being the best leads not only to a healthy 
bottom line for the company, but it also means delivering the best customer 
service as well as the best value for the hard earned money spent by the 
consumer.”</font></p>

<b>Future Plans</b><br>
The company has launched new schemes, including its new travel insurance policy, 
the ‘Navigator’ in Oman. The benefits of the insurance scheme include 
compensation on loss of luggage, sea and mountain rescue, repatriation if a 
family member passes away, and hospitalisation. This unique policy offers a 
bouquet of covers that include 22 services. It takes into consideration any 
possible misfortune a traveller may face. To meet the growing demand, the 
company has opened two more branches at Mawalih and Saham, informs Khadr. It has 
also launched an extensive health insurance policy which is currently being 
marketed.<br>
<br>
With such new plans up its sleeve, Dhofar Insurance has comfortably positioned 
itself vis-à-vis the dawn of competition in the market. For the coming years its 
vision constitutes increasing its capital base and aiming to retain more shares 
in each risk.<br>

        The BAE Systems Hawk programme has achieved another significant 
        milestone, with the UK Ministry of Defence signing a production contract

        Community activities are always the high points for any society. 
        Especially so, during Ramadan. Al Multaqa Al Ramadani (AMAR), an 
        initiative of REACH, was one such event facilitated by LG. As a 
        Community Partner, LG offered its full-fledged support to the local 
        tradition and people by organising more than 100 activities in five 
        regions of Oman — Sohar, Nizwa, Sur, Ibri and Salalah simultaneously. 
        AMAR’s most popular activities supported by LG included internet 
        jamboree, chess tourneys, Qaranqashow, management workshops and Arabic 
        theatre among others. Oman’s youth, living mostly beyond Muscat, follows 
        a global trend of endorsing latest technology making it a focus area for 
        LG’s to understand their tastes and preferences better. To view more

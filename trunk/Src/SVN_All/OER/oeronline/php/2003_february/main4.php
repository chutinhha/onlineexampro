Nayl D'Souza investigates why February 14 this year will not be business as usual for many</b></font></p>

As those in the business prepare to tempt the public with traditional gifts such as greetings cards, flowers, chocolates, cuddly toys, and perfumes for the occasion, many fear a day of ups and downs, simply because this year February 14 falls on a Friday. The date also coincides with the Islamic holiday Eid Al Fitr. Some local traders - particularly florists - say that this may mean that they won't be nearly as busy as they have been in previous years.<br>
                    "Across the world, Valentine's Day is the biggest business day in the florist calendar, but with it falling on a Friday, I'm sure that some florists do not expect a significant increase in business as in past years," says Jane Donaldson who manages Florals in Jawharat A' Shatti Commercial Complex.&nbsp;<br>
 For Daynise Awad who runs Caravans in Al Harthy Complex, Valentine's Day is becoming more of a hit with the general public in the Sultanate each year - particularly young Omanis.&nbsp;<br>
 Awad also says that if Valentine's Day were to fall on a weekday, her shop would receive many orders from people working in offices and Ministries. "Having to deliver to the homestead could deter potential custom. Florists will get orders from husbands, wives and engaged couples but the anonymous gifting will be lost and this usually represents around 25 per cent of the business on Valentine's Day," she explains.&nbsp;</font></p>

He is very optimistic that purchases of
                        jewellery, watches and accessories will improve more as a result of the Eid holiday.</font></p>

                    &quot;Omani men appear more shy when buying flowers and frequently they ask for a bag to put their bouquet in. Some artistic local men are less embarrassed and request some highly decorative arrangements. Conversely, Omani women tend to spend much more time choosing their flower arrangement. Bridal bouquets are also a popular buy among local women."&nbsp;<br>
                    <b> Flower power&nbsp;</b><br>
 Emma Brown, manageress of The Flower Shop in SABCO centre, says, "The supermarkets offer cut flowers but the customer is more discerning, and florists can offer something more design-orientated, fashionable and upmarket."&nbsp;<br>
 A former florist designer in the UK, Brown admits that Muscat's floral demand is much smaller than the scale of floristry she is accustomed to. Her shop generates at least half of its annual revenue by selling dried flowers while designer gift-wrappings offer a notable add-on to the shop's overall level of business.&nbsp;<br>
                    <img border="0" src="valen-2.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="204">&quot;Omanis tend to buy their brothers, sisters and parents flowers on Valentine's Day, which is akin to the US market. In Europe, it is mostly couples that exchange gifts with one another," she adds.&nbsp;<br>
 The flowers from Muscat's major florists come mainly from Holland, although flowers are also imported from South Africa, Ecuador and Thailand. On Valentine's Day, India will also be a favourite place to source roses. Caravans will get flowers from Bangalore because the Dutch rose has reached a level where it cannot be sold for less than RO1.5 (US$3.90). "Even the Indian roses are twice their normal price," says the shop owner. Last year, a medium Dutch rose (60 cm stem) sold for around US$0.48 but shot up to US$1.40 in the run up to Valentine's Day. In comparison, the general price for an Indian rose in 2002 was US$0.20 which doubled to around US$0.40 in mid-February.&nbsp;<br>
 According to Oman's leading florists, red roses will again be the most popular order ahead of February 14 although lilies, tulips and orchards will be battling it out for runners-up spot as they gain in local popularity. While many of us still follow traditional choices of flowers, it appears the more adventurous have branched out in the floral department.&nbsp;<br>
 "Some locals are interested in trying different tinted colours, sizes, varieties and arrangements although the majority of people just want red roses," says Donaldson of Florals. She reveals plans to develop a workshop in the coming months to give tips to people on how to make a perfect flower arrangement and ways to keep flowers and plants living longer. Moreover, Daynise Awad is keen that a NVQ diploma programme be set up to train Omanis to work in the floristry.&nbsp;</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> There are over a dozen florists in Muscat alone, many of them small and employing three or four people. A parallel floriculture market exists in Oman. Market analysts estimate that the country's chief buyer, the Diwan of Royal Court, will spend over US$2.6 million on flowers every year.&nbsp;<br>
 The market fluctuates greatly. Flowers are a luxury, so sales are quick to suffer with economic downturn and there is increased competition from supermarkets. However, business should be back to normal next year with Valentine's Day falling on a Saturday.&nbsp;<br>
                    <b> More than words&nbsp;</b><br>
 The greetings card business is likely to be supplemented by the bleep of the mobile phone this Valentine's Day as the latest craze goes into overdrive. The demand will create a boon for Omantel which received over 100,000 text messages in the first hour of the first evening of Eid Al Adha in 2002 alone, according to a company official. The growth in mobile phone use in Oman has been astonishing with over 450,000 customers able to receive text messages on February 14 (inclusive of Hayyak customers who are able to pick up but not send phone mail).
                    "People like receiving and sending written material for special occasions and many treasure their old cards," says Noushad Khalid, area manager of Cards Store LLC. "Someone's hand writing can tell you a lot about a person and that makes receiving a Valentine's card from an admirer even more exciting."&nbsp;<br>
 Khalid notes that Oman's card shop business is in severe decline. He claims that Cards Store LLC, the exclusive agent for Hallmark, is doing tremendous business in UAE (where it has 28 stores) and Qatar and Bahrain (which have five stores respectively). Carlton Cards operated by Noble House LLC, seems to have also suffered from lacklustre market conditions having slimmed down its operations in the local market to a couple of stores from four shops a few years ago.&nbsp;<br>
                    <b> Making scents&nbsp;</b><br>
 Capital Store LLC will be running GWPs (gifts with purchases) at its perfume counters in the run up to Valentine's Day. Such schemes successfully entice customers to try new fragrances as well as buy old favourites. GWPs have been an increasingly popular method to promote perfumes and improve brand exposure. As mid-February draws closer, most retailers will be increasing their customer communication with new press advertisements, in-store sampling, and on-the-shelf promotions. The company will be looking to mainly benefit from increased sales of perfumes. Stationary (especially pens) and is also considered an ideal gift.&nbsp;<br>
 Some traders do not think that there will be any adverse impact from Valentine's Day falling within the Eid holidays this year despite concerns from others that shoppers could choose to buy one combined gift to celebrate both occasions and therefore reduce their total spending for these events in 2003.&nbsp;<br>
 "Valentine's Day has become a major event for couples in Oman to swap surprise gifts. For the most part, these romantic presents will be bought and gift wrapped for each partner separately. I suspect gifts bought this Eid will be well thought-out purchases made by a couple during shopping trips with far less element of surprise," says Haider Jawad Sultan, managing director of Capital Store
                    LLC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

 The candles are lit, providing a soft glow; beautiful music is gently playing in the background; you've dressed in your most alluring outfit. All you need is a venue. No problem: there are plenty of top restaurants and hotels to choose from in Oman.&nbsp;<br>
 Some of the major hotels in Muscat expect a flurry of business. Marc Fletcher, sales director of Radisson SAS Muscat, says they should not be adversely affected by Valentine's Day falling on a Friday and during the Eid holidays. "Business will be good but not be as brisk as last year when Valentine's Day fell on a Thursday." The Radisson is planning to host a Valentine's Ball for couples on Thursday February 13 to target those who are happier to celebrate the event a day early.&nbsp;<br>
 Despite business uncertainty about whether people will decide to fix a romantic date on Valentine's Day when they realise what date it is fixed on, the Mercure Al Falaj has decided to host a dinner and dance evening for couples on February 14.&nbsp;<br>
 Grand Hyatt, Al Bustan Palace Hotel, Crone Plaza and Muscat Inter-Continental do not plan to hold a particular Valentine's event although most of their restaurants will be decorated to suit the theme, the menus will be altered and the candlelight ambience will be complemented with love music.

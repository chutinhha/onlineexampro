              2003&nbsp;<br>
              The balancing act</font>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>With all the aspects necessary for stimulating economic growth incorporated, Budget 2003 is carefully balanced to sustain the ongoing development process. OER analyses its impact on the economy and meets experts for their forecast of trends&nbsp;</b></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> So what are the two prominent things about the budget this year? Firstly, the government of Oman has sharpened its focus further on sustaining the development process by providing for a large deficit. And secondly, projection of one per cent growth in the domestic economy sounds realistic for ensuring growth within the country.&nbsp;<br>
                    <img border="0" src="cover-makki.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="250"> In its entirety, though Budget 2003 represents a conservative stance on part of the government, it is the aspect of practicality and balancing that deserves applauds. By basing the budget on an average oil price of US$20 (US$2 above the Sixth Five-Year Plan mark) the government has raised optimism and confidence among its people. Cautious assessments have been and will be an integral part of the country's fiscal policies, as oil price and production hold the key to government spending.&nbsp;<br>
 Despite the fact that oil receipts are projected to account for 71 per cent of the total income in 2003, two per cent lower than last year, total revenues are estimated to post a four per cent rise and shall touch RO2.6 billion as compared to RO2.49 billion in 2002. The non-oil sector, which is anticipated to grow at 6.3 per cent, may raise its contribution in addition to the increase in estimated price of oil, which principally should cater to the decrease in the country's oil production.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Defining deficit&nbsp;</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="cover-rajha.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="211">
 Good or bad, but displaying an increase of 5.26 per cent, the excess in planned expenditure over the budgeted revenue receipts is expected to leave a higher deficit of RO400 million in 2003 as compared to RO380 million in the previous budget.&nbsp;<br>
 Many in the business community see this as a necessary step to pursue the ongoing development. A Reguramalingam, investment manager at Bank Dhofar, feels that the size of the fiscal deficit should be viewed together with the growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and not in isolation. "Normally, moderate deficit budgeting is always resorted to achieve GDP growth. For Oman, the budgeted deficit falls within the band of four to five per cent of the GDP growth maintained during the past few years. Hence, deficit cannot be termed as increasing."&nbsp;<br>
 Also commenting on the deficit issue, Abdulrazak Ali Issa, chief executive, BankMuscat, says, "The budget maintains the trend of last year and is growth-oriented. The impact of the fiscal deficit should be considerably lower as the current oil prices would yield better revenues."<br>
                    According to H.E. Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, minister of national economy - the fiscal deficit for 2003 constitutes over 15 per cent of the total revenues. Making an observation, Behram Divecha, chief executive officer of OHI, says, "A deficit of this magnitude ensures investments in the economy. However, no government can solve the problems of the country and its people unless and until the people take it upon themselves and assist the authorities in doing so."&nbsp;<br>
 The deficit for 2003 is to be financed by procuring RO300 million from domestic and external borrowings. This includes a government development bond issue of RO150 million. The balance RO100 million would be drawn from the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF). "This is natural, since due to low LIBOR and its effect on borrowing costs, the government is more likely to borrow locally to finance the deficit instead of abating the reserves substantially," says an industry source.&nbsp;<br>
 Macki also stated that the actual deficit for 2002 was within the lower limits, and this was largely due to the Financial Affairs and Energy Resources Council's resolution last year which stipulated that any additional revenue resulting from oil price increase would be directed to reducing the deficit.&nbsp;<br>
 Normally, revenue earned from the difference between the budgeted and the actual oil price gets deposited in SGRF directly. For 2003, funds withdrawn from SGRF will fund a part of the deficit.&nbsp;<br>
 Zoher Karachiwala, chief financial officer, United Power Company (UPC), holds a similar view. He says, "The lower base of using US$20, as against the current price averaging at US$25, will greatly negate the bulk of the deficit. Moreover, the actual oil revenue, due to price variance, will go to the SGRF and not used to directly finance the deficit."&nbsp;<br>
 Further, Jack Helton, chief executive officer of Salalah Port Services (SPS) thinks that anyone should be somewhat concerned with the rise in the deficit especially with Oman being so dependent on energy.&nbsp;<br>
                    <b> The oil factor&nbsp;</b><br>
 While the picture may look bright for the moment, but what happens if the oil prices drop considerably? Most of the industry sources are of the opinion that in case of an unexpected price crash in the international oil market, the government would swiftly resort to rationing expenditure in such a manner that it does not have a significant impact on the economic growth.&nbsp;<br>
 Issa of BankMuscat observes that much more needs to be done in order to guard the economy from external shocks. He explains, "The government's initiative to stabilise the impact of oil price variation by drawing from the reserves is commendable. However, we need to use
                    <img border="0" src="cover-BehramOHI.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="193"> the reserves to meet a revenue shortfall when the oil prices fall, unlike now when we are using it to meet a revenue shortfall because of lower oil production. This is not desirable. The fall in oil production and the increase in Petroleum Development Oman's (PDO) expenditure should warrant a closer attention. Hence, we need to focus on getting an element of stability and predictability in this area."&nbsp;<br>
 Helton of SPS feels the oil prices used in the budget are not too optimistic. "If the prices were to plummet, it would have a significant impact on the diversification and Omanisation process," he says.<br>
                    It may be worthwhile to note here that oil production at PDO dropped substantially last year, and the trend is expected to continue in 2003. The drop was largely attributed to the maturing nature of wells. A strategy to invest in new technology has been adopted by the company and a recovery in production is expected to happen from early next year.&nbsp;<br>
                    <img border="0" src="cover-jack-helton.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="200"> Factors arresting the growth of oil revenues include a 16 per cent fall in PDO's oil production, and also the fact that average production of crude is considerably higher as compared to any other oil producer in the region. However, around RO319 million is to be invested to revive the oil production levels.&nbsp;<br>
 Karachiwala of UPC observes that the consistent low production of oil is a matter of concern, and this is being tackled by introducing new and improved technology. "One view is that the best time to introduce changes in the technology is when the price of oil is low, and not to do it when the prices are high as the (opportune) cost benefit can go waste."&nbsp;</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Revenue and expenditure</b><br>
 The government's revenue stream is primarily made up of oil (RO1.84 billion), natural gas (RO85 million), current revenue (RO665 million), capital revenue (RO5 million) and capital repayments (RO9 million). Revenue from natural gas has seen a rise of RO2 million over the previous year, as also has the current revenue of RO86 million.&nbsp;<br>
 Moving towards expenditure planning, Macki has acknowledged that despite the deficit, the development expenditure would be maintained, as it would play a key role in delivering growth in the economy. As of now, total expenditures are expected to increase by 4.5 per cent to RO3 billion as compared to RO2.87 billion in 2002.&nbsp;<br>
 Besides the development expenditure of RO280 million, RO12 million shall also be spent on exploration of natural gas alone in addition to purchase and transportation of gas which would cost RO35 million.<br>
                    Speaking on the expenditure front, H.E. Rajha bint Abdulamir bin Ali, undersecretary of development at the Ministry of National Economy, says, "The development expenditure of civilian ministries would remain high in order to stimulate growth. A total allocation for new projects this year is RO223 million. The social sector will receive RO88 million, and two per cent higher (than in 2001) is to be spent on youth and cultural activities. Greater emphasis has been placed on the needy families by providing them with houses and grants to upgrade their living standards."&nbsp;<br>
 "One of the top priorities of the government is to create employment and RO35 million has been allocated for this purpose. The budget will also indirectly help the private sector to provide more jobs to Omanis," she adds.&nbsp;<br>
 The government is providing subsidies to the tune of RO62 million. The primary gainers of these subsidies include the industrial and tourism sectors (RO10 million). Concession loans shall also be provided to people in agricultural, fishery, health, education, and crafts sectors. Provision has also been made for pursuing the implementation of Sanad project for training and employment of the national labour force.&nbsp;<br>
 Striking a different note, Dinkar Rao, general manager, Al Shalman Securities Company, says, "The government needs to build roads, hospitals, schools and invest in human resources. It is no good to cut down expenditure for the sake of balancing the budget. If you do that then you risk an economic stagnation and Oman has proved once again that it does not cut corners when it comes to development," he says.<br>
                    Also, given the range and types of expenditures on policy and programme areas such as education, transport and infrastructure, many sectors of the economy are expected to benefit from the 2003 budget, observe industry sources.&nbsp;<br>
                    <b>Auto worries&nbsp;</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="COV-RAHGU.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="200"> Although automobiles is one of the most-happening sectors in the Sultanate, industry players don't seem to be excited about the government's planned expenditure for the year ahead, says a general manager from a leading car showroom who declined to be named. However, he acknowledges that any projected increase in GDP from the Budget 2003 would be of interest to car companies because any tangible growth will permeate into the economy and ultimately improve consumer spending.&nbsp;<br>
 For Kasthurirengan, general manager of Towell Auto Centre, the Budget 2003 may be termed as growth-oriented in some sections of the media, but he also does not see that there has been any major initiative taken that would strengthen the domestic automobile market.&nbsp;<br>
 "Though tourism, infrastructure development and a commencement of few mega-investment projects in the private sector like fertiliser plant in Sur, a refinery and an aluminium smelter unit in Sohar, should trigger higher demand for vehicles, tyres and automotive products, this is likely to be offset by reduced drilling activity of PDO. This will have a cascading effect on big and small companies (contractors and sub contractors) engaged in downstream oil operations thus lowering the demand for automotives and related products," he explains.&nbsp;</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Good security?&nbsp;</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="COVER-ZOHER.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="216"> Trading at Muscat Securities Market (MSM) posted a good performance towards the end of the year 2002. The MSM Index closed at 192.46 points in December, and most of the brokers are anticipating for this trend to continue in 2003.&nbsp;<br>
 Rao of Al Shalman Securities clarifies that the 2003 budget will help create liquidity in the stock exchange in addition to other factors like high oil prices. "Money spent on infrastructure projects will definitely inspire investor confidence, as more opportunities will be available to the investment sector. The slowdown in the US economy has already created a money surplus which is finding its way to the bourse. Combine this with increased spending, and we can only predict a good year for MSM."&nbsp;<br>
 "The state expenditure should spur its growth since listed companies will benefit the government spending," feels Divecha of OHI.&nbsp;<br>
 The performance of the MSM during 2002 is attributed to improved corporate sector profitability and the regained confidence of the investing public. While it is difficult to forecast stock market performance particularly at a time of global economic uncertainty, it is anticipated that investors will respond positively to the prudent and balanced fiscal and monetary policies of the Sultanate, according to the brokers.&nbsp;<br>
 As far as the banking sector is concerned, the total deposits held with commercial banks as at November 2002 stood at RO2.786 billion as against RO2.634 billion, a rise of 5.8 per cent, as per a Central Bank of Oman report. Also, the banks' total credit outstanding stood at RO3.306 million as at November 2002, compared with RO3.186 million in November 2001, posting a rise of 3.8 per cent. Credit to the private sector stood at RO3.075 million during November 2002, giving a rise of 1.1 per cent.<br>
                    Sources within the banking industry believe that GDP growth with nil inflation, and substantial allocation for development projects broadly sum up the good business potential available for the banking industry in future.&nbsp;<br>
                    <b> Privatisation&nbsp;</b><br>
                    <img border="0" src="COVER-KASTURI.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="150" height="236"> The long awaited and much talked about privatisation of Omantel might happen this year. In any case, the government has approved the privatisation of Al Maha Petroleum Products Marketing Company, the marketing arm of Oman Refinery Company, and shall divest 60 per cent of its stake in the company. The government would also divest a 12 per cent stake in Oman Cement Company (current 63 per cent), and nine per cent in Oman Flour Mills.&nbsp;<br>
 "The partial privatisation of Oman Cement and Oman Flour Mills will serve to raise the level of efficiency and productivity of the companies, absorb the market liquidity and encourage domestic savings. It will also pave the way for earning extra government revenues from the sale of its shares and channel the funds to other investments. Privatisation also stands to increase the liquidity at MSM," informs HE Rajha Ali.&nbsp;<br>
 On other point Divecha of OHI reveals that privatisation is the name of the game today. According to him, it is a well-known and proven fact that the private sector is a more efficient employer and user of the capital than the government. "Therefore, privatisation will allow the government to use its finance for other purposes, including the reduction of the deficit. Privatisation will also ensure that latest practices are incorporated and introduced to ensure continued growth and profitability," he says.&nbsp;<br>
 Also, privatisation per se has been integral of government plans so far and finds its place consistently since the very First FYP of the government. But, as a process, privatisation has faced bumpy rides mainly on account of fluctuating oil prices, in addition to the dynamics of the economy, where major industries were state-owned.&nbsp;<br>
 Not any longer though! Subscribing to the principles of a free market economy, the government, in its efforts to integrate the Sultanate with the global economy, has allowed major private projects to be set up in a cross section of industries and is itself divesting in a lot many. "Privatisation generates a large cash sum from the divestment of state holdings and reduces the potential requirement for further government support. In addition, sourcing of management expertise and accessing new commercial and market opportunities can often enhance business performance through privatisation," says Rao of Al Shalman Securities.<br>
                    "Privatisation of state-run institutions will reduce the government expenditure burden and the business risks involved. The money saved thus can be used for other sectors to generate a useful income. Besides, such policies always encourage international investors and attract funds to create employment in the country," he adds.&nbsp;<br>
                    <b> Real estate&nbsp;</b><br>
 Last month, one of Oman's leading newspapers ran a headline story upon the idea that legislation opening up the Sultanate's real estate for foreigners was about to happen on a freehold basis. Not surprisingly, it created much chatter (particularly among expatriates) who have witnessed the country enact new regulations to liberalise its economy and conform to World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements.&nbsp;<br>
 A senior government official has since confirmed that the Sultanate has been continuing to carefully study a variety of different ways of allowing non-Omanis to own local properties including allowing residency status for expatriates. However, he said that no decision had yet been made as to whether to offer long-term leases or freehold purchases and, moreover, none was imminent. He expects the proposals will be endorsed officially before the end of 2003.&nbsp;<br>
 Property experts forecast that an announcement could be made as early as mid-way through this year. "There will be some positive impact locally from such a move, but Oman will probably not witness a major property boom as there simply isn't sufficient demand to allow this to be created," remarks a property agent. He explains that most countries that have opened up their real estate sector have historically begun by offering long-term leases. For example, Dubai opened up with 99-year leases but now has moved to offering freeholds. He adds, "Although a 99-year lease is acceptable to the Omani market and a step in the right direction, it is clearly not as valuable to buyers as a property sold on a freehold basis."&nbsp;<br>
 "Opening up the property market by allowing expatriates to own properties, will increase demand for residential houses as a new group of buyers enter the market. It is likely that Oman will secure additional permanent, or semi-permanent residents," says another industry source.<br>
                    <b>New taxes&nbsp;</b><br>
 The government has decided to add another aspect to its revenue stream. From April onwards the government will charge a toll fee to all the vehicles crossing the border points. The proceeds from these fees will be transferred to a special fund that will be used to finance part of the maintenance cost of the roads. Moreover, prices of fuel have also been increased by two baisas per litre.&nbsp;<br>
 Divecha of OHI finds these two aspects of the budget difficult to understand. He feels that the moves will be abandoned once the government had the time to see the reaction and effect they have on the economy. "What the government needs to do is to have an open dialogue with the members of the public, local companies and international organisations to put in place schemes that would create extra revenues. This will avoid negative impact on the business community or investor confidence in all areas of the economy," he suggests.&nbsp;<br>
 Helton of SPS feels that such kind of measures might be a deterrent and not a positive contribution to the economy. "Oman does not enjoy a captive market therefore we are heavily influenced by the market conditions."&nbsp;<br>
                    <b> Where do we go now?&nbsp;</b><br>
 All in all, Budget 2003, unlike earlier ones, distinctively emphasises on making the optimum use of the inherent multiplier effects for the benefit of the economy and is well-balanced. Indeed, most of the sectors within the economy have been addressed and overall expenditures have been well-chalked out. But given the fact that the Sultanate's population is soaring, advancements in education, technology, and know-how will be as much necessary.&nbsp;<br>
 No doubt, the budget, which aims at building efficient infrastructure will help the mega projects planned in Sohar to take off, including the methanol, the port and refinery projects. In fact people like Helton of SPS hope that the new port of Salalah breakwater and the free zone development will be funded by the budget.&nbsp;<br>
 Also, it might important to note that Dubai, despite being supported on oil account by other Emirates and a lot by its own tourism and trade, did suffer significantly when oil prices crashed just a few years back. However, the Emirate does have the tendency to bounce back strongly in a short period of time. This means that although diversification is of utmost necessity to Oman, external (oil price) shocks can shake the entire plans up.</font>
                    <font face="Verdana" size="2">Prevailing uncertain global geo-political situation can also impact oil-producing nations in a major way. Considering that the Sultanate contributes about two per cent to the global oil supply. Going by the example - the bigger the crises the faster the smaller economy gets affected first - the key to the success of Budget 2003 may still lie in (high) oil prices. It only remains to be seen now as to how events pan out.&nbsp;</font></p>

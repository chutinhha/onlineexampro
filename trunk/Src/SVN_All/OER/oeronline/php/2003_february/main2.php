                  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Incorporated in 1991 to encourage industrial sector initiative, His Majesty's Cup for Excellence, is a coveted symbol of recognition honouring five leading factories in Oman. The Cup is awarded to the companies that record an excellent performance in all parameters of the evaluation criteria.&nbsp;<br>
 The institution of the Cup has had a positive impact on the core objectives of the award that call for enhancing the productivity and quality levels in the manufacturing sector as well as promoting job opportunities for Omanis. The contest evaluation criteria that have been under constant review, were upgraded recently to include a few more key parameters such as volume of exports (as against the company's production levels), local market share, ISO certification, implementation of Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) regulations, financial status etc.&nbsp;<br>
 This year's contest rules saw one significant change as factories that had won the cup more than five times, were not included for participation but were honoured in a separate category. According to official sources this decision stemmed from an attempt to encourage new companies to aim for the award.&nbsp;<br>
 The five top performers - Jotun Paints, Voltamp Transformers, National Detergent Company (SAOG), Mohsin Haider Darwish's (MHD) Gases Division and Oman Fiber Optic Company (SAOG) were chosen from the 19 entries for His Majesty's Cup. Certificates of Appreciation (COA) were given to Oman Cable Industry, Oman National Dairy Products Company (ONDP), Voltamp Manufacturing Company, National Water Heater Industry and Reem Batteries and Energy Equipment Company.&nbsp;<br>
 Oman Cement Company, Oman Flour Mills Company and Raysut Cement Company, walked away with the awards in the category of five time winners. Government and private sector bodies that had sourced products from the local market were also commended.&nbsp;<br>
                  <b> Jotun Paints Company LLC,</b> which earlier won the Cup in 1999 and 2001, has been a dominant player in Oman's coating industry ever since its incorporation in 1985. According to the company sources, Jotun had begun formulating strategies for winning the Cup as early as 1996. Vijay Kumar, managing director of the company, says, "Our domestic market share has been increasing steadily over the past five years, even though new players and imported paint products have entered the market."<br>
                  The company has also been pursuing their Omanisation policy, and today it has a 48 per cent local staff. In Kumar's words - "We have Omanis at all levels across the organisation." Jotun's exports have also been on the upward gradient for the past three years and the company claims that their export volume to Yemen has reached levels that has necessitated the setting up a manufacturing unit there. Its other overseas markets include East Africa and India.&nbsp;<br>
 Jotun has the distinction of being the first paint company in the Middle East achieve the ISO 9001 Certification.&nbsp;<br>
                  <b> Voltamp Transformers Oman LLC</b>, a 100 per cent Omani-owned, ISO 9001 certified company, manufactures distribution and power transformers, step-up transformers, special transformers and package sub-stations. For the company established in 1993, 2002 Cup is its third within a decade of existence, following those won in 1998 and 2000. Sharad Shah, general manager, Voltamp, says, "Our success bears testimony to our single-minded perseverance of quality and becoming customer-centric."&nbsp;<br>
 Voltamp commands 75 per cent of the local market, and its sales volume for the transformer unit was around RO3 million for 2002. Says Shah, "Our export volumes have been growing by over a 10 per cent average during the last five years. For 2002, our exports were approximately 25 per cent of our total revenues as against 15 per cent, two years back." The company exports to Kuwait, UAE and Yemen. The company's Omanisation level stands at 47 per cent as against 44 per cent earlier.<br>
                  Another third time winner of the Cup, <b> National Detergent Company</b>
                  <b> SAOG (NDC)</b> started manufacturing detergent powder in 1984 and later commenced production of liquid detergent and toilet soap. Other products in its portfolio include - disinfectant floor cleaner, industrial detergents, powder bleaches and shampoos. "Our products are well received in Oman and GCC markets and the company enjoys a 45 per cent in the local market. Exports are likely to be over 70 per cent of the total volume," says V Sundaresan, director and general manager, NDC.<br>
                  "The profit before tax for the year 2001 was RO576,000, and the sales volume for 2002 showed a healthy growth over the past few years, much above the industry growth rate," he adds. In 1995, NDC became the first detergent and soap manufacturing company in the GCC to receive the ISO 9001 Certificate.&nbsp;<br>
 After achieving the requisite Omanisation level of 35 per cent way back in 1990, the company has been consciously bringing more Omanis on to its pay rolls, who currently form 44 per cent of the total workforce.<br>
                  <b>Oman Fiber Optic Company</b>, established in 1996, has bagged the award within three years of starting commercial production in 1999 after winning the Flame of Excellence Award for the year 2001. The company's sales volume for 2001 was RO5.78 million and its profit before tax stood at RO2.12 million. "We have a market share of over 95 per cent in the local market and about 20 per cent in the GCC countries," claims Mohammed Hassan Al Theeb, general manager of the company. The company was awarded ISO 9001 in the very first year of commercial production.&nbsp;<br>
 The company's exports which stood at 19 per cent of its sales volumes in 1999 has risen sharply to 74 per cent of the total sales in 2001. "Focus is given in multi-skilling our Omani workforce. We are today proud of having 45 per cent Omanisation," says Theeb.&nbsp;<br>
                  <b> Mohsin Haider Darwish's (MHD) Gases Division,</b> the pioneer in the manufacturing of industrial and fuel gases was established in 1972 and operates one of the largest oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and acetylene plants in the Sultanate. This division which is also the largest distributor of liquefied petroleum gas, butane and propane has earlier won the Cup in 1997. The company is an ISO 9002 accredited company since 1996.&nbsp;<br>
 "Our market share exceeds 80 per cent in oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, dry ice and acetylene. Our export volume has also substantially increased," reveals A K Paul, general manager of the division.&nbsp;</font></p>

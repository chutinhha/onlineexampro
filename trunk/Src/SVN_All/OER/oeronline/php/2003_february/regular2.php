While I do not intend to discuss time-and-space related issues, the pace at which things are changing in this world is indeed phenomenal. Internet, introduced on a commercial level just a decade ago, has today completely revolutionised the way commerce and trade is transacted around the globe. But, when I think about our national economy, many questions start hovering around my head. How much fuel do we still have to lift our space shuttle (Oman) off to cross that critical zone where we need no fuel to continue our journey? The remaining time is not much. And for majority of us, it is a process that we will see during our lifetime, and yet it seems far a reality that such a time will ever come.&nbsp;<br>
 If we look at our economy as a focal point and that everything else is either a channel - contributing directly to the national economy or a back-office providing support to these channels to produce the desired income - then, the signs are clearly disturbing. Dependence on oil is a national worry. In the next decade or so government resources should strategically be directed towards the development of the tourism industry and other non-oil and gas-related resources (currently they contribute 23 per cent of the total national income). Other areas like human resources, literacy and creation of knowledge-based economy are of great importance.&nbsp;</font></p>

              <font face="Verdana" size="2">Changes in Oman economy if Dubai
              model applied&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> The Dubai phenomenon&nbsp;</b><br>
 Dubai's growth in recent times has been the envy of many nations, leave alone cities. While there are complex issues and financial difficulties connected to a runaway growth, I think people are missing the whole point and the vision of what is happening there. The philosophy of Dubai can be summarised in one sentence - The development-related risks have appropriate safety net of the national income and hence you will be ok.&nbsp;<br>
 Dubai's strategy is to create a momentum that will lift it beyond the critical threshold level; this is yet to be seen in the next decade or two. In its development, Dubai has focused intensively on commerce and trade, but the same principles could be applied to other areas as well.&nbsp;<br>
 A similar model could be applied in creating tourism and a knowledge-based economy in Oman. Besides the investments in industrial projects, Oman should seriously consider tourism as a major contributor to the national economy, perhaps 20 years from now. Despite relatively huge investments and commitments in tourism-related projects by the private sector, and government's efforts to expedite the process of acquiring visas to Oman (for certain nationalities), we have not seen the desired level of tourist activity so far.&nbsp;<br>
 Tourism develops out of an economic and financial mass (e.g. Dubai, Hong Kong, New York), unique characters such as a strong historical background, presence of a special religious or cultural point, or other features (e.g. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya); or a combination of both (e.g. London). Oman certainly is not a financial hub, and as far as the history and culture we do have both, but recognisable on a limited bases.<br>
              <b>So where does Oman stand?&nbsp;</b><br>
 Unfortunately things are not so simple since focus has been on the west. However, we do not meet the criteria that motivate them to visit Oman. Not to mention that Oman is still virtually unknown to the western societies. So the problem is not really in building infrastructure and facilitating the processes of the visit, it is attracting those who we target. Therefore, the million Riyal question is - What do we have to do to attract the targeted tourists? Where do we need to focus our resources and energies? Are we targeting the right people? Who else do we need to target? All these are answerable and strategic questions that will shape our tourism industry for a prosperous future.&nbsp;<br>
              <b> Economy and Omanisation&nbsp;</b><br>
 No doubt that Omanisation is one of the wisest strategies our government has adopted. Omanisation, however, is not an issue that is in isolation from the economy. It has many constituents, and is not a project but rather a process that needs to be reformed. In order to 'Omanise' we need to revisit our economy, social habits, culture, and our educational system.&nbsp;<br>
              <b> Society and culture&nbsp;</b><br>
 Our social structure, without compromising on our values, needs to change. Raising independent children leads to nurturing responsible, reliable, and discipline citizens. These characters are directly linked to Omanisation. The fact is that majority of our population is young. Annual Health Report'2001 prepared by the Ministry of Health shows that 42 per cent of the population is under 14 years of age and 56 per cent are under 19 years, this gives us a good start to develop their skills from now.&nbsp;<br>
              <b> A knowledge-based economy&nbsp;</b><br>
 New developments in the world economy and the transformation from traditional tangible product-based economies to the intellectual and service-based ones, gives us a great hope in the post-oil and gas periods (perhaps 20-30 years from now) to create a knowledge based economy.&nbsp;<br>
 The source of wealth to nations is the amount of knowledge, skills and information its citizens possess. It becomes very crucial to direct the development of our youth towards knowledge and skills. To create a knowledge-based economy, the number of high school graduate transferred to colleges and universities should increase.&nbsp;<br>
 The problem is that our educational system is designed in such a way that it generates more of high school and below levels rather than college and university graduates. An average (Grade-C) student cannot make it to the only major university in the country and his/her chances of getting a scholarship are almost nil. And if one cannot afford the private colleges and universities that are available in the country, chances are that frustration will build up that will lead to quitting education.<br>
              On its surface, this creates a major dilemma for the Omanisation - as majority of the expatriates in this country (i.e. 86 per cent) are high school level and below - and theoretically needs be replaced by an equal educational level of Omanis. Statistics show that a total of approximately 34,000 high school students are graduated every year of which only 2,400 make it to the Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) and a small percentage continue their post high school education in other colleges and universities in Oman or abroad. The rest are added to the employed, unemployed, or not looking for jobs category. High school graduates are far more than what our economy requires and it is extremely important to allow more of our graduates to continue their education after the high school.&nbsp;<br>
 Lastly, diversifying the economy has been a major concern of our government over the past two decades or so. Serious measures have been taken towards finding sources of income other then oil revenues. We realise, however, that we have only reduced our dependence on oil marginally. This indicates that the process is a time consuming one and unless a structural and paradigm shift is initiated, we will continue our diversification at a slow pace. Moving towards focused tourism that is marketed properly might help.&nbsp;<br>
 Market realities have also changed in a major way. Knowledge-based economies are becoming more and more vigilant. Our educational system must reform to incorporate these changing realities. While we are ok for the moment, the time to do all these changes and plan for a diversified future so as to remain ok forever, is now.&nbsp;<br>

A special report by Richard Dean analyses how the markets actually performed against all speculations&nbsp;</font></b><br>
                  <br>
              <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Oil producers will look back on 2002 with great affection. More often than not, the oil price was inside OPEC's optimum target band of US$22-US$28 per barrel. Indeed, the year ended with a barrel of Brent Crude not only breaking through the cartel's price ceiling, but also mounting a serious assault on the psychological US$30 per barrel mark.<br>
              But it could all have been very different. Think back 12 months and oil markets narrated a different story. Crude was selling for around US$17 per barrel as post-9/11 gloom reached its peak. The world economy was in tatters and the airline industry - a major buyer of oil - was in crisis. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, took the drastic step of passing an austerity budget, slashing public spending as panic swept through the Kingdom.&nbsp;<br>
 Worse still, a price war was looming between OPEC and non-OPEC rivals, particularly Russia, Norway and Mexico. OPEC was keen to slash production in a bid to support prices. But earlier production cuts by the cartel had simply led its competitors - principally Russia - to make up the shortfall by pumping more barrels, while at the same time reaping the price benefits of OPEC's restraint.&nbsp;<br>
 By the end of 2001, OPEC heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had had enough. They threatened to flood the market with oil, with Kuwaiti oil minister Adel Al Subaih warning that Gulf producers would drive the price of crude down to US$5 per barrel. (Gulf oil costs around US$1 per barrel to produce, whereas Russian oil costs more than ten times that. The obvious threat was that OPEC would drive Russian producers out of business.)&nbsp;<br>
 Against that climate, Chakib Khelil, Algeria's oil minister, summed up the mood. "I think we will be happy with anything above US$20 for Brent," he said in late December 2001. At the time, even that price seemed recklessly optimistic.&nbsp;<br>
              <b> The new dimension&nbsp;</b><br>
 So what changed? Pinpointing one event when analysing oil market movements is always dangerous - without exception, a host of factors play their part. But looking back on events of a year ago, it's fair to single out the emergency meeting of OPEC heads in Cairo on December 28, 2001 as a defining moment. First, OPEC thrashed out an agreement with Russia, Norway, Mexico and Oman, which saw non-OPEC producers pledge to curb exports by almost 500,000 barrels per day (bpd). Second, and on the back of Russia's co-operation, OPEC agreed to slash its production quotas to 21.7 million bpd - the lowest level for 10 years.<br>
              The move didn't work immediately. The oil market saw that the OPEC/non-OPEC pact was little more than a fragile fudge. Coupled with global economic doom, traders feared that prices would tumble. But to everyone's surprise, by late January it was clear that the deal was holding relatively firm. OPEC's credibility restored, prices began to rise.<br>
              The Cairo deal, then, was the undoubted catalyst for the resurgent oil price in 2002. But that alone was not enough to drive prices towards US$30 per barrel. Brent Crude averaged above US$26 per barrel for the final three-quarters of the year - some 25per cent above the historic, inflation-adjusted average of around US$19 per barrel. Indeed, by April the non-OPEC co-operation was all but over. And by the end of 2002, OPEC members were cheating on their quotas by a staggering three million bpd.&nbsp;<br>
              <b> Changing scenario&nbsp;</b><br>
 So what was really moving the market? As ever with oil markets, supply is only one side of the equation. Demand is equally important. But analysts can hardly point to surging demand as the engine that drove price rises in 2002. The International Energy Agency (IEA), the West's energy watchdog, estimates oil demand growth was around 200,000 bpd in 2002, one of the lowest increases on record. Against average global consumption of 76 million bpd, it is negligible. Indeed, such weak demand would normally lead prices to nosedive.&nbsp;<br>
 Not for the first time, then, the answer lay in the political, not the economic, arena: the main factor was supply fears. Throughout most of the year, oil traders had cause to suspect that international supply would be severely disrupted by political events in a host of major oil producing nations. That sent panic through the markets, as buyers pushed up the price in a desperate bid to ensure supplies in the medium term.&nbsp;<br>
 In April, Israel and Palestine grabbed the attention. Israeli troops launched major offensives in the Palestinian Territories, provoking outrage throughout the Muslim World. Two major oil producers - Iran and Libya - called for a renewal of the Arab oil boycott of the 1970s in a bid to put pressure on the United States to rein in Israeli aggression. Between them, Iran and Libya control some five million bpd of production. Had they made good on their threat they would have sent the price of oil soaring&nbsp;<br>
              <b> The debacle&nbsp;<br>
              </b> By May 2002, it was clear that Iran and Libya were not prepared to follow through. Iraq was more determined, shutting down production for one month. But although Iraq remains a major producer, the world is now well used to - and prepared for - sporadic cuts in Iraqi output, so the gesture had little impact.&nbsp;<br>
 Indeed, it was around this time that the focus turned directly towards Iraq. As early as January, US President George W. Bush named Iraq in his now (in)famous 'Axis of Evil' speech, and by late spring it was clear that he was eager to engineer 'regime change' in Baghdad, by force if necessary. The spectre of war in the Middle East inevitably bids up the price of crude - analysts estimate the value of the 'war premium' at between US$6 per barrel and US$3 per barrel in recent months.&nbsp;<br>
 There were brief signs that the premium was falling in October, when the price of Brent fell by around US$4 per barrel in a month as fears of a broader Middle East conflict eased. But by December, prices were once again on the rise. Half way round the world from Iraq, Venezuela was gripped by a political crisis. Exports from Venezuela, OPEC's number three producer, all but dried up as a general strike brought the national oil industry to its knees. Brent began the month selling for US$25 per barrel, but by December 15 it was above US$28 per barrel, and rising.&nbsp;<br>
              <b> A good year&nbsp;</b><br>
 All of this made 2002 a classic year for oil-watch. Economics and politics - the twin pillars of oil markets - were in turmoil, making the oil price a fascinating story. "I have found this year to be an invigorating and challenging period for our organisation," said outgoing OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman when he addressed members for the last time on December 12, shortly after OPEC had announced that it was raising its output quotas to 23 million bpd.&nbsp;<br>
 In truth, though, 2002 was not especially volatile by recent standards. Oil traded within a US$11 band, between US$17 per barrel and US$28 per barrel. By the standards of oil markets, that's not particularly erratic and a long way for the extremes witnessed in the earlier two years (US$9 per barrel in 2000 and US$35 per barrel in 2001). That allowed OPEC to keep its quotas unchanged throughout the year, and for its members to ensure consistently high yet sustainable oil revenues.&nbsp;<br>
 For all these reasons, OPEC had much to be grateful for in 2002. But with war in Iraq likely (though not inevitable) in 2003, Lukman's successor is surely in for a year that is far more 'challenging' and 'invigorating' than anything witnessed over the past 13 months.&nbsp;</font>

				<b>MOROCCO provides an excellent platform for reaching a wide 
				range of international markets due to its geographic location 
				and cultural ties</b><br>
				<br>
				<b>Business environment</b><br>
				According to a report issued by the World Bank and the 
				International Finance Corporation (IFC), Morocco was the top 
				market reformer in the Middle East and North Africa region in 
				2005-2007. Morocco serves as a competitive regional hub due to 
				its attractive incentives for investment, which include a 
				competitive cost of production, a strong and modern banking 
				sector, transparent and vigorous IPR laws, a flexible labour 
				law, and several Free Trade Agreements, including with the EU 
				and the US. Its political, economic, geographical and financial 
				proximity to the European Union contributes to the dynamism of 
				the economy. Due to their geographical and cultural proximity to 
				Europe, the ability of Moroccans to speak diverse languages like 
				Arabic, French and Spanish and low labour costs make Morocco an 
				attractive destination for foreign investors. The country also 
				provides an excellent platform for reaching a wide range of 
				international markets due to its geographic location and 
				cultural ties.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Economic overview</b><br>
				Morocco’s economy is considered a relatively liberal economy 
				governed by the law of supply and demand. Investors’ confidence 
				in Morocco’s economic environment continues to grow. Morocco has 
				the second-largest non-oil GDP, behind Egypt. Since the early 
				1980s, the Moroccan government has pursued an economic program 
				toward accelerating economic growth with the support of the 
				International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Paris Club 
				of creditors. The country’s currency is now fully convertible 
				for current account transactions. Reforms in the financial 
				sector have been implemented and state enterprises are being 
				privatised. The government aims to liberalise and open the 
				economy to foreign competition and diversify and develop other 
				sectors, especially tourism. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Incentives</b><br>
				Morocco has set in place 16 regional investment centres that 
				enable investors to register their companies within 48 hours, 
				reducing bureaucracy and lowering the cost of starting a 
				business. The Kingdom offers the same tax incentives to domestic 
				and foreign investors. Companies can benefit from various tax 
				exemptions and tax reductions as listed below.<br>
				<br>
				&gt; Permanent tax exemptions are available to certain entities 
				like non-profit organisations and cooperatives<br>
				<br>
				&gt; Export companies are exempt from tax on profits related to 
				their export turnover during the first five years following 
				their first export transaction. These companies benefit from a 
				reduced rate of 17.5 per cent in subsequent years<br>
				<br>
				&gt; Mining companies and companies established in the area around 
				Tangier benefit from a reduced rate of 17.5 per cent<br>
				<br>
				&gt; Export companies established in Moroccan freezones are exempt 
				from corporate income tax for the first 5 years of activity and 
				are subject to a tax rate of 8.75 per cent for the following 20 
				years<br>
				<br>
				&gt; Companies holding a hydrocarbon exploration and production 
				permit are exempt from corporate income tax for 10 years <br>
				<br>
				&gt; Companies located in special economic areas benefit from a 
				reduced rate of 17.5 per cent<br>
				<br>
				&gt; Banks and holding companies located in offshore zones benefit 
				from a reduction in corporate income tax for the first 15 years 
				of operation<br>
				<br>
				<b>Business entity structures</b> <br>
				Foreign investors can use any of the legal forms listed below to 
				conduct business activity in Morocco. The most common legal 
				forms of business entity are the public limited company and the 
				private company with limited liability. Companies should 
				register with the local trade registry, the tax and social 
				authorities. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Limited Liability Companies (SARL)</b><br>
				In a Limited Liability Company (LLC) the liability of the 
				shareholders is limited and shares are not freely transferable. 
				The minimum capital requirement is 10,000 MAD. LLCs are subject 
				to the common law as defined by the Moroccan Tax Code. A 
				statutory auditor must be appointed if the turnover exceeds 
				50,000,000 MAD. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Public Limited Company (SA) </b><br>
				In a Public Limited Company the shares are freely transferable. 
				A minimum of 5 shareholders and a minimum capital of 300,000 MAD 
				is prescribed. In case of listed companies a capital of 
				3,000,000 MAD is required. A statutory auditor must be 
				appointed.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Branches of Foreign Companies</b><br>
				A branch is subject to the same tax regulations as Moroccan 
				companies and to the provisions of tax treaties when they exist.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Permanent Establishment (PE)</b><br>
				PE is the temporary tax representation of a foreign company in 
				Morocco and is subject to the same regulation as the branch 
				except for the local trade registration.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Coordination Centres</b><br>
				Foreign investors may set up coordination centres and engage in 
				management services, liaison work and general administration 
				only for the benefit of the company or the group.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tax implications </b><br>
				The standard corporate tax rate is 30 per cent. Banks, financial 
				institutions and insurance companies are subject to tax at a 
				rate of 37 per cent. Resident and non-resident companies 
				(including PEs) are generally taxed on a territorial basis. For 
				non-resident companies without a registered office in Morocco, 
				taxation on income depends on the availability of a double tax 
				treaty (DTT). There is a special tax regime for foreign 
				companies carrying out engineering construction or assembly work 
				and work on industrial or technical installations. Such 
				companies may opt to be taxed at a lump-sum rate of 8 per cent 
				on the total contract price net of VAT. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Individual income tax</b><br>
				Individual income tax is levied at pro gressive rates that range 
				from 0 per cent to 40 per cent. The 2010 tax bill has proposed a 
				rate of 38 per cent as of January 2010. Tax returns are due 
				before March 31st following the year the income is earned.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Other taxes</b><br>
				The other significant tax to be considered by the foreign 
				investor is VAT. VAT is levied at a standard rate of 20 per cent 
				and reduced rates vary according to product and service. 
				Companies should also consider business licence duty applicable 
				to all legal entities engaged in commercial or industrial 
				activities. Stamp duties, customs and excise duties and other 
				local taxes can also apply.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Double tax treaty </b><br>
				A Double Tax Treaty between the Sultanate of Oman and the 
				Moroccan kingdom was signed in 2007 but has not yet been 
				ratified.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Labour availability</b><br>
				With 30.5 per cent of Morocco’s population aged 14 or younger, 
				job creation for the young is one of the government’s major 
				priorities. The government is also focusing on training the 
				workforce and imparting specialised skills. Urban areas are 
				seeing a growth in available jobs particularly in the services 
				and construction sectors. Business process outsourcing (BPO) and 
				the telecom sector are also proving to be dynamic segments.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Exchange control</b><br>
				The repatriation of funds from Morocco is governed by exchange 
				control regulations, implemented through the Foreign Exchange 
				Office. Companies have a right to transfer funds from Morocco 
				without prior authorisation from the Foreign Exchange Office. 
				However, few formalities need to be completed with the Foreign 
				Exchange Office and banks in charge of transfers operations.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Import regulations</b><br>
				Morocco is a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and 
				follows the Harmonised System (HS) of import classification. 
				Traders are subject to exchange control formalities. Most goods 
				may be imported into Morocco without restrictions. <br>
				The 1996 association agreement with the European Union came into 
				effect in 2000, leading to a free trade area by 2012. A free 
				trade agreement was also signed in June 2004 with the United 
				States, which came into force on 1 January 2006. The Kingdom is 
				also negotiating several trade agreements targeting regional 
				integration.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Summary</b><br>
				As an emerging economy, Morocco provides opportunities to 
				investors and exporters. Its location provides an excellent 
				platform for reaching a wide range of international markets. Low 
				labour costs and the availability of labour along with a policy 
				of structural reforms makes Morocco a promising destination to 
				foreign investors.<br>

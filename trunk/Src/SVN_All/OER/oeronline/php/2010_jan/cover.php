					An

					they will not be able to wash their cars after the servicing 
					because they had terminated the casual workers who did the 
					car-wash, fearing the crackdown on illegal expat workers.<br>
					<br>
					Across the town, another authorised car service station had

					<br>
					These two instances represent the present dilemma being 
					faced by many companies in Oman in the recent past on the 
					issue of manpower. The dilemma has been triggered by the 
					crackdown on illegal expatriate manpower and the 
					simultaneous publication of a Royal Decree amending Oman’s 
					Labour Law to increase the penalties and responsibility for 
					employing illegal manpower. A subsequent ministerial 
					decision asking all companies to strictly fulfil their

                  <br>
                  The manpower issue has always been like a double-edged sword 
                  for the government cutting both ways whichever side you swung 
                  it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Firstly, the government cannot allow a situation where the jobs 
                  that are meant for Omanis (and there is enough local talent 
                  available in the specified segments) are given to expatriate 
                  workers. If unchecked, this will create unemployment issues, 
                  socio-economic unrest besides resentment against legally employed 
                  expatriates and affect the productivity of businesses and companies. 
                  A developing state like the Sultanate, which is moving at a 
                  steady pace, will not be able to afford a negative impact on 
                  the economic engine and stunt the growth of the country as a 
                  whole.<br>
                  <br>
                  Secondly, there is absolutely no doubt that if a country is 
                  having illegal people, it poses not only social problems but 
                  also raises security concerns and impacts the integrity of the 
                  nation. The same holds true for Oman as well. <br>
                  <br>
                  Thirdly, taking advantage of the generous attitude of the government, 
                  many companies have beenpartaking in the employment of people 
                  without proper work permits. This also tantamount to illegal 
                  employment and further denies jobs to Omanis. In this regard, 
                  all the private companies were given a grace period till the 
                  end of 2009 to comply with all the Omanisation targets.|<br>
                  <br>
                  Knowing these situations, the government has vigorously begun 
                  to crack the whip across the whole country. Raids were carried 
                  out in public places, offices, private organisations as well 
                  as specific dwellings where large groups of illegal workers 
                  resided. The most notable development, however, was the Royal 
                  Decree amending the Oman Labour Law and putting responsibility 
                  on both the employer as well as employee for illegal and irregular 
                  workers. This has shaken up the private sector.<br>

                    every illegal worker is taking jobs from the market without 
                    control or measurement. “A ‘black economy’ is not the correct 
                    way to contribute to the development of a country. And sensible 
                    businesses should not be affected by this crackdown. There 
                    has to be a balance between the commercial needs of the business 
                    and the national need to protect and give preference to local 
                    employment,” he says. “Every country in the world protects 
                    its workforce and Oman should be no exception. One would expect 
                    the government to continuously adapt the labour law to encourage 
                    change that is ultimately beneficial to the economy, the local 
                    people and especially the emerging workforce of young people

                    talent like the “Gold Programme” for executive positions;

                    In a bid to assuage the fears of the corporates and come clear 
                    on the government’s latest moves, Shaikh Abdullah bin Nassir 
                    Al Bakri, minister of manpower, has said in the media that 
                    the ministry’s objective was to create an accurate database 
                    of foreign workers in the country; regularise the labour market; 
                    and develop the national manpower.<br>
                    <br>
                    To achieve this objective, a simultaneous crackdown on illegal 
                    expatriates and a warning notice to all companies to comply 
                    with their Omanisation targets as early as possible were in 
                    order. The ministry also believes that the amendments to the 
                    labour laws would help cut down on the irregular and illegal 
                    workforce in the country.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, the business community of Oman, while wholeheartedly 
                    welcoming the authorities’ renewed and rigorous attempts to 
                    create more opportunities to Omanis, has reacted in various 
                    ways. The majority of the corporates fear that the “baby is 
                    being thrown out with the bathwater”.<br>
                    <br>
                    For instance, the oil and gas sector, the primary economic 
                    driver for the country, is facing a peculiar situation. Business 
                    had just picked up with new projects being awarded and manpower 
                    recruitment was on. However, the ministerial decision to comply 
                    strictly with Omanisation targets has put them in a tight 
                    spot.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/cover_img1_jan2010.jpg" height="191" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">“Meeting 
                    the new and higher Omanisation targets in the oil and gas 
                    industry is certainly not an easy matter as we are a highly 
                    Omanised sector. It takes time to fill the higher level positions 
                    and the specialised ones. We are 78 per cent Omanised in the 
                    oil services category. We need more time, apart from the grace 
                    period already granted to us, to implement the targets because 
                    of two reasons. Firstly, the ministry of manpower job codes 
                    for the oil and gas industry is not complete and we would 
                    urge the Ministry to work with the industry and update the 
                    list and it is difficult to get the exact qualified person 
                    for a particular job code particularly for specialists who 
                    do not fit any of the job codes. The second point is our sub-contractors 
                    who employ people on free (Azad) visas. We have requested 
                    them (the contractors) to remove the illegal casual workers. 
                    In cases where these sub-contractors are not complying with 
                    our demands, we are terminating the contract itself,” says 
                    Mohammed Al Kharusi, Director, Human Resources and Information 
                    Technology, MB Holding Company, whose flagship group company 
                    is MB Petroleum Services. Around 5,000 people work in Oman

					</b><br>
					<img src="images/cover_img5_jan2010.jpg" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Kharusi points out that the oil and gas sector needs workers 
					for rigs, drilling sites etc. There is no room for any kind 
					of error as a blowout could cost millions of rials. 
					Therefore, equipping a new employee with the right skills 
					takes training and time to gain the experience. <br>
					<br>
					The situation is similar with many developing sectors like 
					the telecom industry, for example, where the Omanisation 
					target is 65 per cent for technicians. The telecom industry 
					is just around 10 years old and only a few skilled Omanis 
					are available in the job market. And they are all employed 
					in most of the big companies. And if the telecom companies 
					need to meet the ministry targets, they need to poach from 
					other companies by paying a little extra. “This is first of 
					all an unfair practice and secondly it creates an unhealthy 
					competition,” says Aqeel Jawad Sultan, Group Managing 
					Director, Jawad Sultan Enterprises, which also owns Jawad 
					Sultan Technologies, the leading telecom company of Oman.<br>
					<br>
					“Our telecom company, Jawad Sultan Technologies, need more 
					people but the supply is less, therefore we need more time 
					to meet the Omanisation targets, which are very high,” 
					points out Sultan, while saying this particular subject 
					should be escalated to the authorities by the concerned 
					representatives of the industry and the Oman Chamber of 
					Commerce and Industry (OCCI).</font></p>

					<b>Conflicting pressures<br>

					<b>
					<img src="images/cover_img6_jan2010.jpg" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="right"></b>Human resource experts admit that there are conflicting 
					pressures on many businesses in addressing the issue of 
					mismatch between demand and supply of skilled Omani 
					manpower. While it is dependent on the type of industry and 
					role, the pressure is on business managers and owners to 
					hire the desired skills. But they do add that this ‘squeeze’ 
					is a necessity if one has to encourage more employers to 
					develop staff and contribute more to a local workforce.<br>
					<br>
					The situation varies from sector to sector. If the oil &amp; gas 
					and telecom companies face the issue of poaching and find it 
					tough to achieve their Omanisation targets very quickly, the 
					small and medium companies, especially the hospitality 
					sector, anticipate a major challenge during crucial periods 
					if they are unable to hire temporary/ casual labourers. <br>
					<br>
					Aqeel A Munam Sulaiman, CEO, salmancorporation, says that in 
					these days of tough business environment, it is important 
					for medium businesses to have people who have the ability of 
					multi-tasking because, their line of business is such that 
					they have peak times and non-peak times.<br>
					<br>
					“Therefore the Omanisation targets should be flexible. If 
					the retail sector is having 60 per cent Omanisation targets, 
					let it be an overall figure instead of giving sub-category 
					level targets. This will help my Omani brothers and sisters 
					as well, as they will learn multi-tasking and they will be 
					able to progress in their careers, and we would be able to 
					deploy our non-Omani staff during the times when my local 
					staff are on leave or during public holidays,” says Sulaiman, 
					who runs several retail outlets like salmanstores, Caribou 
					Coffee, Pizza Inn, Foto Magic, City Watch, etc.</font></p>

					<img src="images/cover_img3_jan2010.jpg" width="200" height="192" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Talking 
					about practical problems, Sulaiman cites an example of pizza 
					delivery. The branded cars for pizza deliveries are supposed 
					to be driven only by Omanis. The peak demand is during 
					Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The Omanis who are employed 
					as drivers-cum- pizza delivery boys want to take an off on 
					the weekends. So who will drive the cars?<br>
					<br>
					The same will be case for cashiers. We have Omani cashiers 
					in all our shops as per the law. However, during Eid 
					holidays or weekends when our Omani staff want an off we 
					cannot ask non-Omanis to cover for them. Furthermore, for 
					the development of all our staff we would like to rotate 
					them to work in all departments, so it does not help if an 
					Omani is employed to be only a cashier, points out Sulaiman.<br>
					<br>
					Since 2003, the labour law states that it is illegal for an 
					expatriate to work for someone other than their own sponsor. 
					Says Gorvinder Pannu, labour law specialist at Trowers &amp; 
					Hamlins, Muscat office, “Most importantly, it must be 
					remembered that the background to this crackdown and 
					amendments to the labour law is Omanisation. At the moment, 
					expatriate labour is regulated by the labour law so that 
					companies who wish to employ expatriate labour must comply 
					with the prescribed requirements. The obtaining of labour 
					clearance and labour visas will always be subject to 
					Omanisation,” says Pannu.<br>
					<br>
					Concurring with Pannu’s views, Salim Al Kaabi, AGM – HR, 
					BankMuscat, says that in line with the directive of His 
					Majesty Sultan Qaboos, Oman’s manpower policy is centred on 
					further improving the country’s reliance on Omani manpower 
					in all fields. He further says that the policy is linked to 
					the country’s manpower requirements in various sectors and 
					recruitment of expatriate manpower is dependent on 
					non-availability of corresponding trained Omanis. A 
					well-defined strategy linked to education and vocational 
					training of Omanis is helping to achieve the stated 
					objective of nationalisation of human resources, adds Kaabi.</font></p>

					It has been reported that the real estate and construction

					<br>
					According to one report, construction costs in the Sultanate 
					rose by nearly 10 per cent, with the contractors citing

					shortage has been created because companies are now hesitant

					praise for what the ministry of manpower is doing as they 
					have been suffering a lot because people abscond from their 
					company and try and go work elsewhere. “Some people join our 
					company with the sole intention to abscond. So that causes 
					difficulties for us because they steal your visa, labour 
					clearance etc and go work somewhere else where there is no 
					proper Omanisation and proper implementation of the rules,” 
					Erlings says.<br>
					<br>
					Galfar Engineering &amp; Contracting, established in 1972, is 
					one of the largest construction companies in the Middle East 
					with a turnover of over $1bn and has over 27,000 employees.<br>
					<br>
					“If you want someone to work for you, then you get them with 
					proper documents. Otherwise, it is like smuggling, or like 
					trying to avoid the taxes. Actually, all these illegal 
					things disturb the system and create false competition,” 
					says Erlings.</font></p>

					<b>Freely illegal!<br>
					</b><br>
					<b>
				<img src="images/cover_img4_jan2010.jpg" width="200" height="198" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left"></b>According to rough estimates there are about 120,000 Indian 
					expatriates alone who have overstayed or have the ‘free’ 
					visas. This is besides Bangladeshis and Pakistanis, 
					discloses P M Jabir, secretary, community welfare, of the 
					Indian Social Club in Muscat.<br>
					<br>
					Jabir, who has been in Oman for over 20 years, has vast 
					knowledge about labour issues faced by Indian workers. Some 
					of the reasons why workers abscond from companies is because 
					of low salaries or because they are cheated by recruiting 
					agents who take their passports as soon as they come out of 
					Muscat International Airport and then let them loose in the 
					country. While welcoming the government’s move to clean the 
					country of all the illegals and irregulars with the help of 
					the amended labour law, Jabir stressed that the illegal 
					people have realised that things are going to get tough in 
					2010, so there is going to be a huge number of Indian 
					labourers who would want to repatriate. Therefore, he feels 
					that the government should give some facility like a general 
					amnesty for all illegal workers to go back as quickly as 
					possible. This will prevent unnecessary burden on the 
					government’s detention centres, says Jabir who works with 
					Salaam Insurance as a general manager.<br>
					<br>
					Presently, if an illegal expatriate has to leave the country 
					he would have to shell out approximately around 1228 rials 
					multiplied by the number of years he/she has overstayed. The 
					latest reports have indicated that around 15,000 immigrant 
					workers left the country following the implementation of the 
					amended labour law by the authorities.</font></p>

					<b>Curbing exploitation<br>
				</b><br>
					Commenting on the labour law amendments, Jabir is pleased 
					that the sponsor, who sells the ‘free’ visa will no longer 
					be able to exploit the employee. Earlier, the sponsor would 
					sell a visa to a worker, then absolve himself of any 
					legalities by reporting the worker as an absconder in the 
					ministry of manpower but at the same time would continue to 
					collect monthly ‘fees’ from the latter.<br>
					<br>
					It is imperative for an urgent dialogue between the 
					authorities and the private sector representatives to sort 
					out all the issues and arrive at an amicable solution. There 
					is also a need to spread the awareness among the working 
					class expatriate population about their rights in this 
					country to prevent exploitation, which causes them to 
					abscond and become illegal.</font></p>

					<b>Plan and progress<br>
				</b><br>
					<img src="images/cover_img7_jan2010.jpg" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Long term planning is another way to reduce the impact of 
					shortage of casual workers. Industrialised countries have 
					this concept of casual workers but in Oman, the concept has 
					yet to develop and there is no solution to it. Commenting on 
					this issue, Pannu, says, “In my view, the ministry of 
					manpower expects the companies to fill in the temporary 
					demand with Omani workers or staff. However, in case they 
					don’t find enough local workforce, the companies need to 
					make a business case to prove this. <br>
				<br>
				In my personal opinion 
					there is scope for development of the Omani labour law to 
					accommodate casual/ temporary employees in companies.”<br>
					<br>
					Proper planning covering all aspects of a business, 
					including human resources, is essential to run a successful 
					venture and solve the issue of mismatch between demand and 
					supply of Omani manpower, adds Kaabi while saying that in 
					the prevailing situation, companies ought to abide by the 
					law of the land. </font></p>

					<b>Investing in education<br>
				</b><br>
					Investing in educational infrastructure to provide more 
					facilities for training the Omanis and developing their 
					talent is another thought which has been mooted. As Sultan 
					puts it, all the qualified graduates work hard to get 
					government jobs and companies are left with only high school 
					students. This is a fact, which affects all the private 
					companies. Therefore, universities and educational 
					institutes should provide that little bit more facility for 
					imparting the right training that is suitable for the job 
					market, says Sultan.<br>
					“There is also a need for cultural education to bring 
					awareness among young Omanis on the value of work, the need 
					to obtain skills, and not to be selfish but think about 
					developing their own country,” Sultan advises.<br>
					<br>
					On a different note, it must be understood that Oman as a 
					developing country is just one and a half generation old. 
					The social mores, the tradition and the culture of this land 
					are gradually evolving. A couple of decades ago, only one 
					member of a family of ten would be working, whereas the 
					situation today has changed drastically. Now it is not only 
					two or three of the family, but even the women have girdled 
					themselves up as they have been empowered and elevated to 
					their rightful place in the society under the benevolent 
					leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said.<br>
					<br>
					As the next generation assimilates the knowledge and 
					experience of the present generation and strives to improve 
					on the shortcomings of their elders, companies will have at 
					their disposal more locals who recognise that “work is 
					worship” and have the requisite skillsets.<br>

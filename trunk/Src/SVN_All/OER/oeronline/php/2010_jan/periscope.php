				<b>If the US Federal reserve decides that inflation is its 
				greatest threat and decides to stop the pumping of cash into the 
				banking system then the 1994 history could repeat itself with a 
				vengeance in 2010</b><br>
				<br>
				The Federal Reserve was ultra-dovish about the prospects for the 
				US economy and inflation, as the November FOMC conclave promised 
				to keep the policy rate (the Fed funds rate) “exceptionally low 
				for an extended period”. The US unemployment rate has risen 
				higher to 10.2 per cent. However, it is imprudent to be too 
				complacent about the prospects for interest rates, as too many 
				investors in the Gulf, who finance risk assets, do when they 
				borrow short-term money to buy high yield bonds, shares and even 
				commodities. Why?<br>
				<br>
				One, long term US Treasury note yields have begun to creep 
				higher as economic data (ISM, third quarter GDP, net exports, 
				and industrial production) suggests the US has emerged 
				convincingly from the worst recession since the 1930s. A 3.5 per 
				cent yield on the ten-year US Treasury note is at least 200 
				points below the average for the last two decades. Long rates 
				are abnormally low only in the last two decades because US 
				banks, flush with deposits, decided to buy Uncle Sam debt, not 
				increase their loan books. Yet as the economy revives, banks 
				will increase their loan books while selling government 
				securities.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Credit easing</b><br>
				Two, the Federal Reserve bought almost $1.5trn in Treasury bonds 
				and mortgage backed securities, Bernanke’s fabled credit easing 
				to avert a second Great Depression. However, as the money market 
				wounds heal and credit risk-spreads compress to pre-Lehman 
				levels, the central banks must necessarily unwind their 
				liquidity support programmes. This suggests, ipso facto, that 
				dollar interest rates must move higher.<br>
				<br>
				Three, central banks have begun to tighten interest rates as the 
				global business cycle turns, led by China’s trillion dollar bank 
				lending spree and 9 per cent GDP hyper growth. Norway and 
				Australia have raised interest rates. China, India and South 
				Korea could well be next. The ECB’s Trichet has expressed 
				concern about inflation risk. Brazil has imposed a tax on hot 
				money inflows. Net result: Global rates are moving higher. US 
				rates could well follow.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The commodity effect</b><br>
				Four, gold has risen almost $400 an ounce since the immediate 
				post Lehman aftermath. Crude oil has surged from $32 to $80. 
				Inflation risk is priced into commodities, not government debt. 
				Yet if the US Treasury bond market incorporates a higher 
				inflation risk premium, the ten-year note yield will surge from 
				its current 3.5 to five per cent by sometime next summer. This 
				will cause mayhem in the global financial market and could well 
				trigger another stock market and oil price collapse. In any 
				case, if oil prices spike above $100, the global economy will 
				have to confront the demons of inflation, not deflation. The 
				surge in gold suggests that the Fed is behind the curve on 
				inflation. Five, Obamanomics is a fiscal nightmare. The US 
				budget deficit could well be almost $2trn in 2011. So supply 
				risk will overwhelm the US Treasury debt market at the precise 
				moment when commercial banks reduce their holdings to finance 
				loan growth and the central banks unwinds TALP. This is a 
				classic formula for a bond market massacre. No budget deficit 
				reduction is plausible now.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Threat of inflation</b><br>
				Six, the spread between two-year and 10-year US Treasury bond 
				yield has surged to record highs. This means the yield curve 
				prices in higher economic growth and hawkish Fed policy 
				response. The bond market is on the edge of an epic sell off, a 
				bloodbath similar to 1994, when major banks and hedge funds 
				collapsed as the Greenspan Fed unexpectedly tightened monetary 
				policy to pre-empt inflation. History could repeat itself with a 
				vengeance in 2010 if the Fed decides that inflation, not a 
				double dip recession, is its greatest threat and decides that 
				Helicopter Ben’s monetary pump must stop pumping cash into the 
				banking system. I can easily envisage the two-year Treasury note 
				yield at 2.5 per cent and ten-year T-note at 5 per cent if the 
				central bank decides that it is time to tighten.<br>
				<br>
				The bearish bond market scenario has profound implication for 
				GCC investor. Short-term borrowing rates could well hike. The 
				dollar could well surge against the Euro even as crude oil 
				prices and gold plunge. GCC sovereign bond credit spreads could 
				spike higher. Emerging markets would fall in unison, bringing 
				the GCC summer rally to a premature end. This is the time to 
				sell greed, buy fear. Unfortunately, the GCC investor believes 
				in short finance, long risk assets (property, equities and oil), 
				a recipe for disaster as the interest rate carry trade de jour 
				unwinds.<br>
				<br>
				Gold has surged to all time highs, unlike crude oil and silver. 
				The Indian central bank’s move to buy 200 tonnes of IMF bullion 
				proves that gold is now a de facto reserve currency for the 
				world’s elite central banks. Sri Lanka, whose government finally 
				vanquished the Tamil Tigers and ended a 25-year civil war, has 
				begun to accumulate gold, whose prices have risen in Euro, yen 
				and sterling. Central banks in emerging economies have, in 
				essence ignited a stealth global run on the dollar. This alone 
				increases the risks of an epic disaster in the US Treasury bond 
				market next year.<br>

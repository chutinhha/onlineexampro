            </b> </font>As one looked forward to a relaxed Eid holidays, came 
            the shocking news of Dubai World asking its creditors for a standstill 
            agreement till May 2010, for restructuring debt worth $26bn. The developments 
            affected sentiment across the globe – stock markets across the world 
            fell by five per cent on fears that this could delay the economic 
            recovery for much longer. Moody’s and S&amp;P immediately cut their 
            rating for Dubai-based government related entities and placed them 
            on credit watch. In a world where perceptions matter more than reality, 
            the crisis has given a body blow to the emirate’s reputation as a 
            destination of choice for tourists, investors and capital. The ramifications

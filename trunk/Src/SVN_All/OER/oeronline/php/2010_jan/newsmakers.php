				of the media to catch up with Omar Adli Al Sharif and 
				congratulate him on becoming a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers 
				Oman</b><br><br>
				<img border="0" src="images/newsmakers_img1_jan2010.jpg" width="200" height="224" align="left" hspace="9" vspace="5">Adli 
				Al Sharif has become the first Omani to become a partner in 
				global firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). In fact, he could be 
				called the first Omani to become a qualified partner in any of 
				the big four auditing firms in the country. Al Sharif currently 
				holds the position of Audit Director in Assurance/Business 
				Advisory Services leading the Energy Utilities Mining/Technology 
				Infocomm Entertainment (EUM/TICE) groups in 
				PricewaterhouseCoopers, Oman. He will take up his new position 
				in January 2010.<br>
				<br>
				“I am grateful to the firm for recognising my hard work and 
				achievements, and also for the confidence they have shown in me 
				by giving me this opportunity,” Al Sharif says. He is honoured 
				by the promotion, the partnership process being both rigorous 
				and challenging; and also happy for his family, who have had to 
				make sacrifices in order to allow him to focus on this career 
				that comes with long hours and tight deadlines. <br>
				<br>
				Al Sharif is fully aware of the great onus on him when he says 
				that as a partner you are wearing many hats. Aside from leading 
				the firm with fellow partners, a partner must ensure the 
				delivery of the firm’s services to its clients and that the 
				client needs and expectations should always be a priority. Also, 
				a partner will be signing the opinion in the financial 
				statements on behalf of the firm and therefore he must ensure 
				that the quality of work is of the highest standard. <br>
				<br>
				From an early age, Al Sharif knew that he wanted to join an 
				auditing firm. After completing school, he joined in one of the 
				firms operating in Oman as an intern, and later joined PwC. 
				While in PwC, Al Sharif went on to complete his accounting 
				technician course (AAT) and the ACCA exam.<br>
				<br>
				In Oman, PwC splits its services into Assurance, which is mainly 
				external and internal audit; and Advisory, which includes 
				services such as corporate finance, transaction services, people 
				and change, risk, strategy, internal audit and tax. Al Sharif 
				says that a part of his new responsibility would be to focus on 
				continuing sustainable growth and cementing PwC’s position as 
				the top assurance/advisory firm in the country. According to Al 
				Sharif, the firm understands that their success is connected to 
				the development of Omanis, and as a result PwC has always 
				contributed towards the development of Omanis in several ways. 
				Aside from hiring Omani graduates every year, staff are 
				regularly seconded on a short-term basis of up to nine months to 
				other regional offices. Al Sharif is also proud of the fact that 
				PwC also organises long-term secondments for qualified local 
				staff to overseas offices, in order to provide international 
				exposure and help them gain practical experience. It was on one 
				such secondment to London that Al Sharif was able to prove his 
				mettle.<br>
				<br>
				The firm also elects Omani staff members to high-flyer 
				programmes like the Middle East Falcon Programme and provides 
				educational support for achieving professional qualifications 
				such as ACCA and CPA qualifications. <br>&nbsp;<br>

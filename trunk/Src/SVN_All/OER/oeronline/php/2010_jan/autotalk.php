                    </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">It’s been a while since 
                    we have seen an all-new Prado, so when we were called to the 
                    launch of the new 2010 model, to be perfectly honest, we weren’t 
                    expecting as much of a change in the model as we witnessed 
                    on that day. Malcolm Xavier Crasta gives a full test-drive 
                    report</font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br>
                    <br>
                    </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">The new Prado has 
                    had a complete makeover in almost every area, from the chassis 
                    and body up through the V6 petrol engine. The changes included 
                    everything from a restyled exterior and interior to a whole 
                    bevy of technological innovations and mechanical improvements 
                    to make the new model a more prominent competitor in its segment. 
                    There was only one way to find out if these changes actually 
                    lived up to their claims – take it for a drive in the mountains 
                    near Qantab.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Stepping Inside</b><br>
                    <img src="images/autotalk_img1_jan2010.jpg" width="300" height="221" hspace="9" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">The 
                    changes to the exterior of the Prado are subtle and for the 
                    most part it still looks a lot like the existing Prado. But 
                    now it feels more muscular, larger and definitely has better 
                    road presence. On the inside the changes are much more apparent. 
                    While there doesn’t seem to be anything particularly eye-catching 
                    about it, it is a very pleasant place to be seated. There 
                    are no hard, ugly or drab plastics anywhere in sight. All 
                    buttons are big, chunky and exactly where you would expect 
                    them to be. The dash is easy to read and the ambient lighting 
                    around the cabin is also a nice touch that is rare to find 
                    in vehicles of this class. If there was anything to complain 
                    about, it would have to be the navigation screen, which in 
                    bright daylight and at certain angles can be hard to see clearly.<br>
                    <br>
                    For those of you willing to splurge on higher-end models, 
                    toys are not in short supply, with Toyota’s Multi Terrain 
                    Select, Multi terrain ABS, Crawl Control, Satellite Navigation, 
                    14-speaker Navigation, cameras all around the vehicle and 
                    a lot more available at your disposal. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The Drive</b><br>
                    On one hand we were slightly disappointed to not get the full-option 
                    off-road version of the Prado since we were quite eager to 
                    try out the new off-road technology available on it. On the 
                    other, we were pleased to be handed the keys for a nearly 
                    new full-option 4.0l on-road version. As such our review pertains 
                    to this engine only, since there are two other engine variations 
                    available to you.<br>
                    On the road, the new Prado is everything you expect, and more. 
                    The power unit is a 4.0l V6 producing 271hp and 38.9kg-m of 
                    torque which is more than enough for daily city drives. Its 
                    acceleration on road is not really brisk but it isn’t slow 
                    and sluggish either, it can best be described as leisurely. 
                    The drive itself is smooth and refinement is also at its best 
                    with barely a hint of engine and wind noise at cruising speeds.<br>
                    <br>
                    But despite its on-road performance, it is off the beaten 
                    path that it truly shines. Even without all the off-road wizardry 
                    available in the alternative model, the new Prado easily overshadows 
                    its predecessor. We took it over gravel, rocks, steep climbs 
                    with soft mud and much more, and the vehicle just ate it up 
                    without even breaking a sweat. About the only things we couldn’t 
                    try out were its water wading ability and sand. But we see 
                    no reason why it shouldn’t excel in these two mediums as well. 
                    We can only imagine how good it could truly be with the aid 
                    of the missing tech in our vehicle.<br>
                    <br>
                    As a whole, the vehicle is a clear improvement over its predecessor 
                    in every way but it has come with an increase in the price. 
                    But when you consider what you are getting, it is definitely 
                    worth it and is highly recommended. </font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br>

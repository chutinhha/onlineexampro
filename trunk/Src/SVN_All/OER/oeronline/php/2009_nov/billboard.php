                        corporate product development says: “We’re all aware that 
                        today’s commercial environment is very demanding. To succeed 
                        you need to be flexible and responsive to the market – 
                        iMass Volume SMS will enable businesses to do just that. 
                        It’ll help get marketing messages out when they’re most 
                        needed and most effective. And let’s face it, given the 
                        level of mobile phone penetration in Oman, SMS is a very 
                        potent tool, enabling mobile marketers to reach consumers 
                        across all demographics. There’s so much to be said for 
                        a good, solid mobile marketing campaign; it’s affordable 
                        for businesses of all sizes and is amazingly effective. 
                        Studies show that mobile marketing messages are typically 
                        read within an average of 15 minutes of receipt – how’s 
                        that for impact? Recall rates are assessed at over 75 
                        per cent and on top of that, as SMS campaigns are paper-free, 
                        they’re very much a green option. What more could you 
                        want?”</font></div>

                    <b>The Landmark Group is one of the largest retailers in the 
                    Middle East. Akshay Bhatnagar and Sushmita Sarkhel, in conversation 
                    with Clive Freeman, the new GM of Landmark Group, Oman</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What was the objective behind your move to Oman?<img border="0" src="images/img56.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5" width="230" height="283"></b><br>
                    It was mostly a business requirement. The Landmark Group regularly 
                    reviews its operations in various countries and it is customary 
                    to transfer personnel from one territory to another. Saibal 
                    Basu has been here as the GM for the last three years and 
                    has done a remarkable job. He is now moving on to head operations 
                    in Kuwait and I was asked if I’d like to move to Oman, to 
                    which I readily agreed.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What are your first impressions about Oman?</b><br>
                    I’m delighted to be here. It’s very different than anything 
                    you can find anywhere else. The diversity of scenery and landscape 
                    is incredible. The city of Muscat is extremely modern but 
                    at the same time it has still managed to retain its cultural 
                    heritage and it’s all extremely impressive.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What are the expectations of the group from you?</b><br>
                    My focus would be retail operations – to review where we are 
                    now, to work with the team and inject some fresh ideas into 
                    the business, listen to people who’ve been with Landmark for 
                    a long time, while trying to bring in positive changes wherever 
                    required. The Landmark Group and its Chairman Micky Jagtiani 
                    have always believed that the customer comes first and hence 
                    all that we do is based around this philosophy. Value for 
                    money merchandise at a world-class retail environment is our 
                    single minded objective. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Do you feel there are any gaps on the customer service 
                    front?</b><br>
                    I believe that we’re mainly a customer service focused business 
                    but I know there’s always place for improvement in any business 
                    as customer expectations are always on the rise. We don’t 
                    believe that we have achieved all the levels that we aim to. 
                    Today the retail industry in very dynamic and we have to keep 
                    moving forward with the changing times. Customer service has 
                    become increasingly important for any business over the last 
                    10 years and we at the Landmark Group constantly innovate 
                    and upgrade ourselves to satisfy the needs of the end customer.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>In what ways would you like to improve customer service?</b><br>
                    I believe it’s important that everyone in our business delivers 
                    on customer service. The only way we can do that is to make 
                    sure that we have a very strong foundation in our training. 
                    The basic is to go through core principles with every member 
                    of our team. We have to make sure that they are understood, 
                    reviewed, acted upon and delivered. The way to monitor our 
                    progress is through feedback from the customer. Based on that 
                    we make amendments where necessary and make things right.<br>
                    <br>
                    We will be introducing systems to deliver the best service 
                    in our stores. After sales and intensive staff training is 
                    high on our agenda to ensure the best follow up for customers. 
                    For example, at Home Centre we will be following up each delivery 
                    by contacting the householder, to ensure they are happy with 
                    the product and will request them for feedback on the delivery 
                    team who attended. Additionally we will have a team of technicians 
                    who will visit the customer’s house two weeks after delivery, 
                    to make additional adjustments to the furniture if required.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Give us a brief overview of the current state of operations 
                    in Oman?</b><br>
                    Currently we have Centrepoint, a destination bringing together 
                    the Group’s core retail brands under one roof: Shoe Mart, 
                    Babyshop, Lifestyle and Splash. Our business here is made 
                    up of five Centrepoint stores, three Home Centers, one E Max 
                    and three Max stores. We also have franchise brand stores, 
                    Bata and Ecco in Muscat City Centre and Dumond and Pablosky 
                    in QCC. The Max store in Sohar has just opened with good initial 
                    sales. In Salalah, we have Centrepoint and Max. Other than 
                    Sohar and Salalah, we are also looking at expanding our business 
                    into areas outside the main cities e.g. Barka and Nizwa. Our 
                    total retail space is currently just over 500,000 sq. ft. 
                    This will increase over the next few years.<br>
                    <br>
                    Training and recruiting nationals is a key focus area for 
                    us. The government has always supported us since our inception 
                    here and we are very thankful. As an organisation we are committed 
                    to social initiatives and cease every opportunity to give 
                    back to society.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How is each retail brand faring?</b><br>
                    We have <img src="images/img57.jpg" width="160" height="232" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">a 
                    diverse range of retail goods from high fashion, baby products, 
                    footwear, furniture and electronics. The region and indeed 
                    the whole world is facing exceptional challenges arising from 
                    the global liquidity crisis. Thriving in the face of challenge 
                    is key to retail and we are trying to do just that. Countries 
                    have reacted differently to the economic crisis. But one thing 
                    is common – consumers have become more cautious. We will continue 
                    with our core principals of the widest range of goods under 
                    one roof at the most competitive prices. Our wide range of 
                    merchandise and multi-brand approach helps us stay in healthy 
                    competition. We carry out continual market research on our 
                    pricing and we make sure that we retain our position in the 
                    marketplace. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What has the growth been like for each segment?</b><br>
                    Electronics and furniture are segments which are challenging 
                    for any retailer and we’ve set our plans to this accord for 
                    the current year. The global meltdown has indeed been a serious 
                    issue and we hope in the next few months, there will be consumer 
                    confidence returning to the market. With our main focus on 
                    value-for-money merchandise we hope to rise above the crisis.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Have you looked at changing your vendor base or renegotiated 
                    contracts with existing vendors?</b><br>
                    Landmark works on a long term strategy and that’s how the 
                    business has grown today from one store in 1973 to a turnover 
                    of $3.5 billion today. Our supplier base and negotiations 
                    of our contracts are done on a continual basis. As a company 
                    we have extremely skilled buyers, planners and merchandisers 
                    who are always looking to expand and improve our vendor base. 
                    We look at what the market is offering and listen to the needs 
                    of the customer and then address that need.<br>
                    <br>
                    Tell us about the new logistics warehouse that you’re planning 
                    to set up.<br>
                    <br>
                    Constant innovation and upgrading is the key to the retail 
                    industry. We have to , adapt and move forward with today’s 
                    dynamic market requirements. Backend operations is the backbone 
                    of retail and ensuring steady progress in the field of supply 
                    chain management is essential for a successful retail business. 
                    We felt it was time to dedicate a standalone state-of-the-art 
                    warehouse facility, whereby we can bring in the latest innovations 
                    under one roof. For our new warehouse, we are looking at a 
                    15,000 sq. m size facility. Accessibility to the warehouse 
                    is important to the business we are in and hence we are going 
                    to look at an area close to Muscat.<br>
                    <br>
                    We are also looking at a round-the-clock warehouse management 
                    operation to increase productivity and ensure smooth running 
                    of the business and hope to achieve this in the next 24 months. 
                    We are not going to compromise on our requirements, we know 
                    what we need to achieve and we are going to go ahead and deliver!<br>

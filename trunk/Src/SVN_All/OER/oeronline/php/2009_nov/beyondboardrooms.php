                    <br>
                    Hassan Ahmed Mohsin has been in the finance industr<img src="images/img84.jpg" width="397" height="312" hspace="9" vspace="6" align="right">y 
                    for over 18 years. He started with SGRS and then moved on 
                    to Oman &amp; Emirates Investment Holding Company where he 
                    headed the investment banking division and his responsibilities 
                    included brokerage and fund management. Mohsin continued in 
                    the asset management field moving to FINCORP and Vision Investment 
                    Services later. In fact, he was also involved in the formation 
                    of FINCORP as he was working in one of the three companies 
                    that merged to form the company in 2003 (initiated in 2001). 
                    After his stint at Vision, he decided to start his own company.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The first step</b><br>
                    “We set up Horizons Capital Markets in 2008 after getting 
                    a licence from CMA. Setting up involved a lot of major activities 
                    like raising of funds, conceptualising the business model, 
                    selecting the shareholders and the management team” says Mohsin. 
                    Despite the adverse economic situation he saw an opportunity 
                    in every new development. The company worked hard on evaluating 
                    trends in investment banking sector and assessing the needs 
                    of investors. He adds, “We noticed that there was awareness 
                    of investment products. Financial assets and markets were 
                    given importance and were being appreciated in the society.” 
                    This gave him the confidence to go ahead with the plan to 
                    setup a company.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Time out</b><br>
                    Thanks to his long working hours, spending time with his family 
                    requires an extra effort. Though he makes sure that he makes 
                    up for it over weekends. When he is not spending time at work 
                    or with his family, he is usually reading or at times playing 
                    sports such as tennis, football, snooker and swimming in small 
                    groups. He also enjoys travelling, especially to Europe because 
                    of its great weather. Most of his reading is dedicated to 
                    books relating to business and management skills. “It is important 
                    for business leaders to have a balanced lifestyle and positive 
                    thinking. Social and management skills are at times more valuable 
                    than a person’s academic qualification but it is often overlooked” 
                    says Mohsin. Other than business books he also read books 
                    on history and the interpretation of the Quran.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Although this is the first time that I have been in such 
                    a high position in a company, my experience with other companies 
                    in Oman has allowed me to carry this company through its tough 
                    initial stages and hopefully will do so for a long time to 
                    come. It is a totally different experience when you create 
                    something new and when you realise that your decisions affect 
                    so many people. This experience also changes the way you interact 
                    with your family and friends for the better, since you now 
                    think and decide for the benefit of an entire group rather 
                    than at an individual level” he concludes.<br>

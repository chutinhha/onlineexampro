                    <b>Mazoon Mobile and Samatel are the latest mobile resellers 
                    to enter the telecom sector. Visvas Paul D Karra does a status 
                    check of their prospects in a saturated market</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Nearly a year and a half after five Class II mobile licences 
                    were awarded by th<img src="images/img30.jpg" width="350" height="246" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">e 
                    Telecom Regulatory Authority of Oman, two more companies have 
                    got into the act. Mazoon Mobile and Samatel are resellers 
                    who finally inked pacts with Nawras to utilise the latter’s 
                    network to provide mobile services to customers throughout 
                    the Sultanate. Friendi Mobile (Arabia Connect) and Renna (Majan 
                    Telecommunications) were the first ones off the block, with 
                    an agreement to ride on Oman Mobile’s network infrastructure. 
                    That was exactly a year ago. Then, there was no news about 
                    the other three licence holders, namely Injaz International, 
                    Kalam Telecommunications, and Mazoon Mobile. After this, word 
                    came that the Bahrain-based Kalam Telecommunications had backed 
                    out and its licence was granted to an Omani company Samatel.<br>
                    <br>
                    With three companies in waiting, curiosity grew about the 
                    network provider that these resellers would choose. The anticipation 
                    ended, when two of the three, namely Samatel and Mazoon Mobile, 
                    signed up with Nawras giving mobile users an additional choice 
                    (once they roll out operations). Mazoon Mobile is an Omani 
                    licensed mobile services reseller formed by a joint venture 
                    between METCO (Middle East Telecom Company), a subsidiary 
                    of WJ Towell Group and Etisalcom, Bahrain. Samatel, in contrast 
                    is a 100 per cent Omani company with Sheikh Khalid Al Matani 
                    as its sole promoter.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Present market conditions</b><br>
                    Although both <img src="images/img31.jpg" width="150" height="203" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Samatel 
                    and Mazoon Mobile are upbeat about their impending launch, 
                    market watchers feel that it will not be easy going for these 
                    players as there are already four players operating in the 
                    mobile telephony market. While Friendi Mobile has been shrewd 
                    enough to concentrate on its target segment – expatriates 
                    from the Indian subcontinent. Renna, is on Friendi’s heels 
                    trying to get a share of the same customer base. The ensuing 
                    competition triggered a price war, forcing all the mobile 
                    operators to slash their international call rates, for fear 
                    of losing the lucrative and large expatriate population living 
                    in the country.<br>
                    <br>
                    Not to be outdone, Friendi Mobile went one step further and 
                    tied up with Idea, a mobile company operating in the southern 
                    Indian State of Kerala offering a call price that is lower 
                    than the existing call rates to calls originating and terminating 
                    with Idea. This is a strategic move for Friendi because out 
                    of the 600,000 Indians living in Oman, atleast half hail from 
                    Kerala. Arabia Connect, the parent company of Friendi, launched 
                    Halafoni, a separate brand targeting the youth of Oman directly 
                    taking on the Shababiah brand of Nawras.<br>
                    <br>
                    In this liberalised scenario, it would be interesting to see 
                    how the new mobile resellers are going to position themselves 
                    and whether they can make inroads into new segments or erode 
                    the market share of the existing players.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Spadework in place</b><br>
                    Dr Wael Taher, CEO of Samatel, informs that they have a two-pronged 
                    business strategy. Not only will the company be launching 
                    a pre-paid mobile service but it will also set up a contact 
                    centre which will attract outsourcing businesses like managing 
                    services, consultancy etc. Samatel’s building in Ghala will 
                    house a 140-seat contact centre as well as its mobile operations. 
                    Another contact centre will be established in Mawal<img src="images/img33.jpg" width="300" height="365" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">eh 
                    with a capacity of 600-700 seats.<br>
                    <br>
                    To help them get the contact centre up and running, Samatel 
                    has tied up with Teleperformers -- the biggest outsourcing 
                    company in the world. Teleperformers has 75,000-plus seats 
                    in over 15 countries. For the mobile operations, Samatel has 
                    entered into an agreement with Effortel from Belgium, an MVNE 
                    (mobile virtual network enabler), which facilitates the entry 
                    of companies into the mobile reselling business.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mazoon Mobile, on its part, has partnered with major system 
                    suppliers to provide its operating platform besides the agreement 
                    with Nawras to use its infrastructure to deliver <br>
                    its services.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Quality differentiator</b><br>
                    Jamil Ali Sultan, Chairman of Mazoon Mobile, commenting about 
                    the signing of an agreement with Nawras, says that this was 
                    a moment they all had been keenly awaiting. “Although, there 
                    were a few hiccups and delays in the past year with regards 
                    to the choice of partnership, we finally signed with Nawras 
                    and we are very excited about this,” he says. <br>
                    <br>
                    As far as competition is concerned, Sultan admits that the 
                    competition is tough and only players who provide quality 
                    service and real value to end users will survive. Talking 
                    about their roadmap, he hints that Mazoon Mobile’s products 
                    will spell class, “We are not going to do magic and we will 
                    not get into a price war. We will distinguish ourselves with 
                    value added services with a stress on quality. Our approach 
                    will be different. My message to the end users is to look 
                    for quality even if it means paying a little extra money. 
                    However, there will something for everyone to enjoy, he added” 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In its pursuit of providing class to the masses, Mazoon Mobile 
                    is not looking at short-term gains. Being a part of the W 
                    J Towell Group the service provider can rest assured about 
                    financial support from its parent to establish the brand in 
                    the long run. Building on Sultan’s comments, Mohammed Alhashili, 
                    CEO, adds that Mazoon Mobile aims to be a model mobile reseller 
                    in the Middle East by addressing customer lifestyle needs 
                    and delivering value with unique experience to the Omani mobile 
                    market, as well as to build an organisation with the right 
                    talent and opportunities for growth.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Creating a value</b><br>
                    “We are designing our products in such a way that mobile users 
                    will cherish our SIM cards as valuable commodity, like an 
                    ATM card, instead of throwing it away after using<img src="images/img32.jpg" width="300" height="243" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left"> 
                    up the currency in it as it is happening with the present 
                    mobile companies,” says Alhashili, while talking about their 
                    strategy to take on the competition. A lot of SIM cards ‘donated’ 
                    by the current resellers as part of their promotional offers, 
                    reportedly, have been discarded by users after using up the 
                    inbuilt free currency.<br>
                    <br>
                    In this regard, Alhashili message to the mobile operators 
                    is, “let us all work on creating longterm value to the end 
                    user rather short term price promotions. “when we create a 
                    service as a voucher it does not help at all.” The reason 
                    is because, every time a SIM card is discarded, there is a 
                    customer acquisition cost, which ultimately will prove detrimental 
                    to the service provider if there is a huge turnaround in mobile 
                    users. Efficiency in activating new connections and product 
                    packaging with attractive tariffs and added values are going 
                    to be some of the unique features, which will draw customers 
                    to Mazoon Mobile, adds Alhashili.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Telecom culture</b><br>
                    Samatel is promising to give a new definition to the market 
                    in Oman by introducing a whole new telecommunications culture. 
                    The company will not only be providing the basic mobile phone 
                    services but it will also be integrating itself into the social 
                    fabric of the country with a whole lot of services such as 
                    the contact centre, a telecom academy etc. “We will be generating 
                    a slew of economic activities which will generate a number 
                    of employment opportunities. For example, our two contact 
                    centres will be employing around 1000 people straightaway. 
                    This is discounting our mobile phone operations which will 
                    generate more jobs,” says Taher, who previously worked with 
                    Oman Mobile as contact centre manager. He then went to Dubai 
                    and worked as senior manager, sales and retention, customer 
                    care, at Etisalat before returning to Oman to head the Samatel 
                    operations.<br>
                    <br>
                    Samatel will launch its mobile services in February 2010 by 
                    which time the whole infrastructure will be ready, informs 
                    Taher, the youngest CEO of a mobile company in Oman.<br>
                    <br>
                    “We will be offering more benefits for the same price and 
                    value added services that are not present in Oman. This could 
                    be in the form of web-based services, loyalty programmes or 
                    offering a choice of products in one bundle,” says Taher when 
                    asked about Samatel’s USP to attract customers. Offering customised 
                    solutions to a number of niche segments is an option, which 
                    Samatel may explore to target new customers. Examples of such 
                    audience are the small and medium enterprises and the media. 
                    With a tangible shift of strategy from just wooing voice-driven 
                    customers to providing value to their SIM cards, we hope that 
                    Mazoon Mobile and Samatel will be the game changers in the 
                    mobile telephony market of Oman.</font></p>

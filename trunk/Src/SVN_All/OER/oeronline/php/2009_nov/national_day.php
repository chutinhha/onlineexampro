                    The private sector has indeed grown and prospered side-by-side 
                    with the growth and development of the country. N<b><img src="images/img15_new.jpg" width="350" height="237" hspace="8" vspace="6" border="0" align="right"></b>o 
                    doubt, such a pleasant partnership is a direct result of the 
                    wise leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. This 
                    leadership has provided Oman with unmatched security, stability 
                    and consistency of macro and micro socio-economic policies 
                    and an environment where racial harmony and equal opportunities 
                    prevail. These are, in fact, the key ingredients for any country 
                    to prosper. Before the start of oil exports in 1967, Oman’s 
                    economy was more oriented towards domestic and international 
                    trade. Imports were mainly for meeting basic domestic needs 
                    whilst exports were limited to dates, limes and fish. Interestingly, 
                    Oman at that time was also an exporter of manpower. All that 
                    has changed for the better and Oman has itself become a large 
                    importer of labour.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Sea change</b><br>
                    If you look at the progress of Oman’s private sector, in the 
                    early 1970s most of the businesses were concentrating on trading, 
                    small scale real estate developments and obtaining agencies 
                    for foreign made products but that changed gradually – first 
                    towards industrialisation for import substitution and thereafter 
                    towards industrialisation for exports. The large scale industries 
                    of fertilisers, methanol, steel and LNG, are a testimony to 
                    Oman’s march towards that goal. Furthermore, the private sector 
                    has, now moved into areas where the government was hitherto 
                    the sole provider. For example, you can now see an increasing 
                    role for the private sector in health, education, electricity 
                    and water production, transmission and distribution.<br>
                    The role of the private sector, which in most economies is 
                    the main wealth creator, is dynamic and always changes with 
                    the various stages of development a country normally moves 
                    through. In Oman, for example, in 1970’s and 1980’s, the government 
                    was either acting as sole investor or as a major partner in 
                    setting up industries like Oman Cement, Oman Flour Mills, 
                    banks like Oman Housing Bank and Oman Development Bank, hotels 
                    etc. This role has evolved now and the private sector has 
                    become the dominant investor in hotels and tourism complexes, 
                    industries and even hospitals and clinics, universities and 
                    colleges.<br>
                    Although private businesses are driven by profits, and they 
                    should be, but their role in national building and socio-economic 
                    development will always remain crucial. The role of the private 
                    sector, for example, in job creation is extremely important. 
                    Today in Oman, the private sector employs more than two thirds 
                    of the total labour force. Providing job opportunities to 
                    Omanis is the key to spreading prosperity and enhancing the 
                    quality of life.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The Key Economic Driver</b><br>
                    Mohammed Al Barwani, Chairman, MB Holding Co points to the 
                    increasing numbers of Omanis getting jobs in the private businesses 
                    as a proof of the corporate sector’s contribution to nation 
                    building<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><img src="images/img17_new1.jpg" width="270" height="248" hspace="8" vspace="6" border="0" align="left"></b> 
                    When I joined Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) in 1976 as 
                    a petroleum engineer, there were only four rigs with a daily 
                    production of 200,000 bpd. Thirty-three years later, PDO has 
                    over 50 rigs deployed all over the Sultanate with production 
                    peaking at 800,000 bpd. In those days, we used to think that 
                    oil production would finish by 2020, however today the production 
                    is still going strong. Definitely, the country has grown tremendously 
                    in these intervening years under His Majesty Sultan Qaboos 
                    bin Said.<br>
                    <br>
                    Again, in those days, most of the oil companies were international 
                    but today, you have a majority of local companies providing 
                    allied services to PDO. I left PDO in 1986 to start my own 
                    company. In this period, the country has changed a lot. The 
                    GDP of Oman has doubled or tripled and if you look at the 
                    number of schools, hospitals and infrastructure development, 
                    the country has come a long way. The whole place has changed.<br>
                    <br>
                    The private sector of Oman is maturing nicely, comparable 
                    to any other developed nation. It has also emerged as the 
                    main job-creator. If you look at the increasing number of 
                    Omanis being employed in the private sector, it gives you 
                    an indication of the development of the private sector.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Taking out a leaf </b><br>
                    Where would India be without the Tatas, Reliances and Infosys? 
                    Where would Germany be without Siemens and BMW? In Japan and 
                    Korea, Toyota and Samsung respectively contributed to nation 
                    building. Everywhere, the private sector has been the key 
                    economic driver.<br>
                    <br>
                    Of course, we do make profits. However, if we are providing 
                    employment to thousands of Omanis and making some wealth as 
                    well, what is wrong with it? I think it is more important 
                    to highlight the contribution of the private sector to the 
                    national economy. But some of the existing labour policies 
                    have to change in order to allow the private sector to expand 
                    smoothly in the future. Like for example, we have no issues 
                    in employing any number of Omanis but we should also have 
                    the right to hire and fire. The future looks great but we 
                    should work to make it great.<br>

                    <b>Main Conduit of Employment Generation</b><br>

                    opportunities and drive the economy to greater heights avers

                    In 1957, I travelled on a dhow from Muscat to Sur for a business 
                    purpose. It took 18 hours. You also could take the camel train 
                    between the two destinations. Today you have a superfast coastal 
                    highway along the same path, taking you to Sur in a fraction 
                    of the time it took me then.<br>
                    <br>
                    Definitely, the country has grown tremendously in the last 
                    39 years under the benevolent leadership of His Majesty The 
                    Sultan. I can say that we are truly blessed. What makes a 
                    country is its people. Oman’s greatest asset are its people. 
                    The social fabric is multicultural and multi-ethnic and the 
                    people are very hospitable. It is a very open society where 
                    you can practice your own faith.<br>
                    <br>
                    When you talk of nation-building, the private sector has a 
                    very big role to play, as it is the main conduit for employment 
                    generation. A prosperous private sector will sow the seeds 
                    of employment opportunities in the country and drive the economy. 
                    Earlier only one person in a family of 10 would work, now 
                    you have four or more members of a family seeking employment.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Joint efforts</b><br>
                    The government has started public-private partnerships in 
                    many sectors. It is the responsibility of the private sector 
                    to take the country to the next level. Improving efficiency 
                    and productivity of workers will greatly contribute to the 
                    growth of private businesses. <br>
                    <br>
                    We are in a time capsule at the moment where the country is 
                    about a generation-and-a-half-old. We are celebrating 39 years 
                    of modern Oman, so if you look at the work culture there is 
                    so much more maturity that is required.Things are however 
                    in a state of change. So what we have not achieved in the 
                    last 39 years in terms of efficiency and productivity, will 
                    surely be done in the coming years.<br>
                    <br>
                    Looking at the future, I feel that too many holidays are hampering 
                    work flow. The government should have emergency windows for 
                    banks, immigration etc during holidays to ensure continuity 
                    of business. And the government should not specify Omanisation 
                    percentages in each sector, but look at the overall numbers 
                    employed in individual organisations.<br>

                    Maqbool Hameed al Saleh, Chairman, OHI Group of Companies 
                    dispels the impression that businesses are merely driven by 
                    a motivation to make profits<br>

                    The private sector is playing a pivotal role in the nation 
                    building process, thanks to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin 
                    Said’s vision. He has encouraged the private sector to play 
                    an active role in building the national economy, whereby the 
                    corporate sector has contributed as well as benefitted from 
                    the process. The private sector has been playing its role 
                    in nation building hand-in-hand with the public sector. Being 
                    a young country, the public sector set up those industries, 
                    which were priorities in the area of infrastructure and which 
                    required a huge capital investment. The government now intends 
                    to privatise many of these investments, again emphasising 
                    the role assigned to the private sector. <br>
                    <br>
                    We are now in the 39th year of the blessed Renaissance. Right 
                    from the start His Majesty provided the opportunity for entrepreneurial 
                    skills in the corporate sector to flourish. With 39 years 
                    of experience behind us, I do believe that businesses are 
                    fully capable of taking on the role of wealth and job creators. 
                    Any person who is doing business his or her aim is to contribute 
                    to the nation. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Profit driven growth </b><br>
                    The perception that businessmen are only driven by profits 
                    is not right. In a capitalist economy, profit is an important 
                    component for businesses to flourish. It is the profit motive 
                    which attracts risk capital to flow in, thereby growing the 
                    economy. However, there is an increasing awareness and recognition 
                    that profit alone cannot be the barometer to judge business 
                    success. This is true in Oman as well. Businesses are recognising 
                    the concept of triple bottom line reporting, which has the 
                    elements of profits, sustainability and community development. 
                    To cite an example, the OHI group has two radio stations – 
                    Hi and Hala FM, while they may not be money spinners, these 
                    stations are playing an important role in information dissemination 
                    in society. When we built hotels in Sohar and Muscat in the 
                    1970s and 1980s, it was to give tourists and business travellers 
                    adequate facilities while visiting Oman. Thus every business 
                    makes a contribution in its own way. <br>
                    <br>
                    I would not say that there are impediments to hold back the 
                    private sector. Having said that, the bureaucratic machinery 
                    would benefit with more operational streamlining, enabling 
                    a speedier decision making process. I am sure this will happen 
                    as the will to make this happen is there at the very top.<br>

                    As a part of an economy, if a business does not invest back 
                    in the economy and society then it would be self defeating. 
                    The corporate sector needs to invest in Omanis and look at 
                    developing the SME sector as it is the backbone of any economy 
                    and the biggest employment generator. The private sector in 
                    Oman has played a big role in promoting innovation and information 
                    technology (IT). While 40 years may sound like a big number, 
                    in the life of a nation or a race, it is a very short span 
                    of time. When the blessed Renaissance started in the 1970s, 
                    most of the employment was in the public sector, but gradually 
                    over the years the private sector has been playing a bigger 
                    role in employment generation. <br>
                    <br>
                    The corporate sector is working as a partner in the government’s 
                    Omanisation policy. While the policy needs to be aligned with 
                    the needs of the private sector, companies and businesses 
                    can do much more on their own. The Zubair Group has started 
                    its own Gold programme, to bring more Omanis into middle and 
                    senior management positions. <br>

                    <b>Catching on </b><br>
                    The more mature a organisation, the more it is capable in 
                    terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Slowly and 
                    surely people in Oman are realising that CSR is not a black 
                    hole but a worthwhile investment. It is great to see companies 
                    like Nawras and OmanMobile playing a big role in giving back 
                    to the society. <br>
                    <br>
                    The private sector will touch everyone’s lives on a day-to-day 
                    basis only if it controls the infrastructure of the country. 
                    This kind of a transfer of ownership has happened in developed 
                    economies, but the corporate sector in the Sultanate is not 
                    ready to take on that role.<br>
                    <br>
                    For example, the government owned Oman National Transport 
                    Company (ONTC) manages the public transport system. Its mandate 
                    is to provide such a service for the majority of people. If 
                    this service was handed over to a private company, chances 
                    are that they may not be interested in running unprofitable 
                    routes. Finally, the government has taken great strides and 
                    we are pleased with the level of transparency and systems 
                    that have been put in place.<br>

                    Libya is situated on the southern Mediterranean coast between 
                    Egypt and Tunisia. Its economy is heavily dependent upon the 
                    oil &amp; gas industry with few other natural resources or 
                    industries. Agriculture is the second sector in the economy; 
                    the development of the tourism industry is also a priority. 
                    The financial, legal and commercial sectors are developing 
                    and structural reforms have been and are being implemented.<br>
                    <br>
                    There is a widespread road network which supports an efficient 
                    distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the 
                    region. Population is based along the coast and is centred 
                    in the major cities of Tripoli in the west and Benghazi in 
                    the east. Libya is a controlled economy but the private sector 
                    is being encouraged to develop. Arabic is the official business 
                    language but English and Italian are widely understood.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Economic overview</b><br>
                    Current major economic activity is centred around hydrocarbons 
                    but Libya is seeking to diversify and develop other sectors 
                    and at the same time develop its infrastructure. In the past 
                    two years it has signed major contracts for the building of 
                    a new airport, roads, housing and mixed use developments.<br>
                    <br>
                    The government recognises the need to attract foreign investment 
                    and has made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader 
                    campaign to reintegrate the country into the international 
                    fold. It has been successful in attracting foreign direct 
                    investment especially in the energy sector.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Incentives</b><br>
                    Investment by foreign oil companies in exploration is governed 
                    by the terms of the current EPSA IV (Exploration and Production 
                    Sharing Agreement). Investment in other sectors is undertaken 
                    within the framework of the Investment Law which provides 
                    for a minimum five year corporate tax holiday for projects 
                    which fulfill one or more of the following objectives:<br>
                    <br>
                    Production of goods for export<br>
                    <br>
                    Make available positions of employment for Libyan manpower<br>
                    <br>
                    Contribute to the enhancement or development of the economy<br>
                    <br>
                    Make use of local raw materials<br>
                    <br>
                    Contribute to the growth and development of underdeveloped 
                    areas<br>
                    <br>
                    Approved tourism projects are granted a 10 year corporate 
                    tax holiday. <br>
                    <br>
                    Foreign investment is welcomed in any business sector approved 
                    by the cabinet. Approval for a project is required from an 
                    Investment Board and a minimum investment of LYD 5 million 
                    is required (LYD 2 million if the foreign interest in the 
                    investment is less than 50 per cent).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Structure of business entities</b><br>
                    All foreign companies seeking to work in Libya must establish 
                    a corporate body. Historically, foreign companies established 
                    branches and they may still do so under the Investment Law 
                    if they undertake a limited number of permitted activities. 
                    However, in all other cases a Libyan joint stock company must 
                    be established in order to operate in Libya.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>1. Libyan joint stock company</b><br>
                    These companies must have a minimum share capital of LYD 1 
                    million and the foreign shareholder may own a maximum of 65 
                    per cent of the share capital. Governance of the company by 
                    its directors and the requirement to report to the shareholders 
                    at the annual general meeting are similar to international 
                    requirements. The chairman of the Board of Directors, comprising 
                    a minimum of three members, must be a Libyan.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Branches of Foreign Companies</b><br>
                    A branch must bring in the foreign currency equivalent of 
                    LYD 150,000 as branch capital. The company must appoint a 
                    Libyan as branch manager.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Structures used by foreign investors</b><br>
                    The form of business entity which is set up in Libya by foreign 
                    investors can be different and is often driven by their different 
                    commercial operations and needs. Nevertheless, a company structure 
                    is commonly used for most types of businesses by foreign investors.<br>
                    <br>
                    Branches and joint stock companies are both subject to all 
                    laws of General Application. A branch and a company are formed 
                    by filing memorandum and articles of association, together 
                    with certain specified forms and resolutions, with the Secretariat 
                    of Economy. Registration of a branch normally takes a minimum 
                    of three months but would normally be less for a company. 
                    Annual formalities include the requirement to prepare annual 
                    financial statements and to have them audited by a Libyan 
                    Public Accountant. Such financial statements should be filed 
                    with the Secretariat of Economy and Trade but are not available 
                    for inspection by the public.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tax implications</b><br>
                    Under the Income Tax Law, tax rates are progressive and increase 
                    to 40 per cent of profits above LYD 2 million plus Jihad Tax 
                    of 4 per cent of profits. There are no other corporate taxes 
                    on profits.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Withholding taxes</b><br>
                    There is no withholding tax on dividends or on the remittance 
                    of branch profits to a foreign head office. Resident and non-resident 
                    branches and companies, that receive royalties or similar 
                    payments or interest payments, are subject to Libya taxes. 
                    Foreign individuals are subject to tax only from income arising 
                    in Libya.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Individual Income Tax</b><br>
                    Individual income tax is levied at progressive rates, with 
                    a maximum marginal rate of 15 per cent plus 3 per cent Jihad 
                    Tax. Payments are deducted by the employer at source and paid 
                    to the authorities monthly.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Double tax agreement</b><br>
                    There is no Double Tax Agreement between the Sultanate of 
                    Oman and Libya.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Labour availability</b><img border="0" src="images/img49.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5" width="152" height="249"><br>
                    Libya has an available, educated, and literate workforce but 
                    in certain sectors it lacks skills. The Libyan manpower department 
                    therefore requires that foreign companies undertake to employ 
                    and train national employees as a condition of working in 
                    Libya.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Social security</b><br>
                    Libya has a general social security system. Social security 
                    is payable by all national and foreign residents at the rates 
                    of 3.75 per cent of gross salary for the employee and 11.25 
                    per cent of gross salary for the employer.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Exchange control</b><br>
                    The repatriation of funds from Libya is governed by exchange 
                    control regulations issued by the Central Bank of Libya. The 
                    Libyan dinar is generally not a transferrable currency but 
                    provisions exist in the Investment Law to transfer profits 
                    earned in Libyan dinars. In other circumstances, where the 
                    receipts under a contract are in a foreign currency, profits 
                    are in essence freely remittable.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Import regulations</b><br>
                    Libya has applied for membership to the World Trade Organisation 
                    (WTO) and follows the Harmonised System (HS) of import classification. 
                    Traders are subject to exchange control approval, administered 
                    by the Central Bank of Libya. Most goods may be imported into 
                    Libya though there is a list of prohibited items. Import permits 
                    are required and Libya complies with the Arab Boycott of Israel.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Summary</b><br>
                    In summary, Libya, as a developing economy provides a number 
                    of opportunities for Omani investors and exporters. <br>

                    Making history in Oman’s 
                    mobile industry, Oman Mobile’s subscribers list has crossed 
                    the one million mark. Oman Mobile has footprint over 90 per 
                    cent of the populated areas in the country. It offers an 
                    extensive roaming as it has strategic partnership with 
                    service providers in more than 85 countries worldwide. When 
                    Nawras was launched it was speculated that Oman Mobile’s 
                    market share might get dented but Oman Mobile has emerged 
                    stronger with a record-breaking subscription base.<br>
                    <br>
                    The growth in the subscriber base of Oman Mobile could be 
                    attributed to its wide range of offerings, including Taif,

                    to issue GDRs</b><br>
                    BankMuscat (SAOG) has become the first Omani institution to 
                    go in for a Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) issue. At an 
                    extraordinary general meeting in August, the shareholders of 
                    BankMuscat approved a proposal to allow the bank to increase 
                    its authorized share capital from RO75 million to RO125 
                    million, comprising 125 million shares of a nominal value of 
                    RO1 each. 
                    The bank plans to issue up to 6,878,765 GDRs, which 
                    represents 10 per cent of the bank’s issued share capital. 
                    BankMuscat has obtained all necessary regulatory approvals
                    to go ahead with the proposed issue. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sheikh AbdulMalik bin 
                    Abdullah Al Khalili, Chairman, BankMuscat said: “BankMuscat 
                    has always been open to considering internationally accepted 
                    funding options when seeking to raise funds. The GDR route, 
                    we believe, will allow us to maintain the lowest possible 
                    dilution, while considerably enhancing shareholder value. 
                    This is an important step forward to us both as an 
                    organization that is committed to providing superior returns 
                    to our stakeholders as well as a leading Omani institution 
                    that is fast setting new benchmarks in the international 
                    banking arena.” He added, “We believe this will result into 
                    far greater international investor interest in Oman and its 
                    economy and will also set a trend that many institutions can 
                    follow, resulting in greater inflow of foreign capital into 
                    the country.” <br>
                    <br>
                    The bank has applied to the UK Listing Authority for its 
                    GDRs to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange. 
                    The net proceeds of GDRs are expected to fund the 
                    development of both BankMuscat’s domestic banking operations 
                    and international operations. Citigroup has been appointed 
                    as global coordinator and sole book-runner for the planned 
                    issue. HSBC has been appointed the local custodian to this 
                    issue.<br>
                    <br>
                    BankMuscat has been declared as the ‘Best Internet Consumer 
                    Bank’ for 2005 by Global Finance, a leading New York-based 
                    financial magazine. Commenting on the achievement, 
                    AbdulRazak Ali Issa, Chief Executive, BankMuscat said: 
                    “Oman, as most countries across the world, is today 
                    witnessing a greater demand for technologyenabled 
                    alternative banking channels that provide greater customer 
                    convenience. BankMuscat has continually developed and 
                    improved its online banking services in keeping with its 
                    commitment to bringing world-class banking services to the 
                    country.”</font></p>

                    RO4.52 million reported in the first half of 2004. The

                    among the top 100 global brands, has posted the biggest gain 
                    in value of any global brand with a 186 per cent surge over 
                    the past five years.<br>

                    The report, considered to be one of the most prestigious 
                    global brand studies, states that Samsung's key success 
                    factor was its strategy to build a strong, single brand 
                    experience coupled with innovating cool-design digital 
                    products that displayed the company’s technical prowess. In 
                    addition to offering advanced technology, Samsung has always 
                    put<br>
                    emphasis on creating an arresting brand experience for 
                    consumers. <br>
                    <br>
                    This is one of the crucial factors that, we believe, has 
                    contributed immensely to the growth of our brand value,”

                        <b>NBO net profit up </b><br>
                    National Bank of Oman S.A.O.G. 
                    has announced a net profit of RO6.7 million in the first 
                    half of 2005 compared to RO2.6 million reported for the same 
                    period in 2004. Net Interest Margin for the period up to 
                    June 2005 amounting to RO14.4 million increased by RO2 
                    million (16 per cent) compared to the six-month period
                    ended June 2004. The improvement was attributed to 
                    optimizing the asset and liabilities
                    position as well achieving growth in the performing assets 
                    book as compared to the same period in 2004.On the cost 
                    control front, the Other Operating costs for the six months 
                    at
                    RO9.4 million were lower by around RO1.4 million (13 per 
                    cent) as compared to the same period in 2004. The focus on 
                    cost control is expected to continue.<br>
                    <br>
                    As per the bank release, during the first six months, 
                    additional loan loss provisions of RO10.2 million were taken 
                    as compared to RO7.1 million for the same period in 2004. 
                    This resulted in a further improvement in the provision 
                    coverage on non-performing assets in this quarter to 83.5 
                    per cent as compared to the 81.5 per cent in December 2004 
                    and 75.8 per cent in June 2004. The Bank continues to make 
                    good progress on recovery against non-performing assets. <br>
                    <br>
                    This resulted in enhanced recoveries of RO7.9 million during 
                    the six months as compared to RO3.4 million for the six 
                    months ended June 2004. Progress was achieved in enhancing 
                    value for the bank’s shareholders with the share price 
                    appreciating from RO2.450 per share at the beginning of the 
                    year to RO4.500 at the end of June 2005,
                    an increase of 84 per cent. The bank’s market capitalization 
                    increased from RO171 million as at December 2004 to RO315 
                    million as at June 2005.</font></p>

                        <b>GSP rates for Switzerland &amp; Turkey</b><br>
                    OCIPED in co-ordination with UNCTAD, Geneva, has compiled 
                    the GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) rates for 
                    Switzerland and Turkey for the benefit of Omani industries. 
                    This is apart from the GSP rates already available for the 
                    EU, the USA and Japan. The expiry date for the GSP scheme of 
                    Turkey is December 31, 2005 and for the<br>
                    GSP scheme of Switzerland is February 2007.<br>
                    <br>
                    The GSP, an initiative of the United Nations Conference on 
                    Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is operated by all major 
                    industrialized nations, known as donor countries, with the 
                    basic objective of increasing the export (foreign exchange) 
                    earnings of developing<br>
                    and least developed beneficiary countries, promoting their 
                    industrialization and accelerating their rate of economic 
                    growth.<br>
                    <br>
                    Under the GSP scheme, any Omani producer, whether involved 
                    in agriculture, industry or handicraft production and able 
                    to comply fully with the relevant terms and conditions, is 
                    able to derive benefit from the GSP scheme, of which Oman is 
                    a beneficiary.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, such benefit is restricted to the product 
                    identified by the donor country to be eligible for GSP 
                    benefit. Currently, the Sultanate of Oman also enjoys GSP 
                    for the EU,<br>
                    Japan and the USA. The GSP scheme of Japan expires in 2011, 
                    the USA GSP scheme in 2006 and the GSP scheme ofEU in 2005.</font></p>

                    Nissan considers the Gulf market as the severest in the 
                    world, demanding extensive modifications to new models that 
                    can be launched successfully elsewhere with relatively 
                    minimal variation from standard specifications. Eiji Imai, 
                    Nissan’s Senior Vice-President in charge of corporate 
                    quality assurance and customer service, revealed how the 
                    manufacturer copes with adapting vehicles to the region’s 
                    grueling environment.<br>
                    <br>
                    At a Press meet in Muscat recently, Imai explained how the 
                    company goes to extreme lengths to ensure that the company’s 
                    models launched in the Gulf perform to the same 
                    international standards expected of the brand, despite the 
                    unique motoring conditions that prevail in the region. The 
                    recently launched full Infiniti line-up (G Coupe &amp; Sedan, Q 
                    Sedan, FX Crossover and QX SUV), Nissan Armada and Murano 
                    SUVs as well as the Nissan Altima and 350Z were all 
                    extensively modified to handle the extremes of Gulf 
                    temperature, roads, and sand storms, with up to 500 changes 
                    made to the standard specifications for each model, Imai 
                    said.</font></p>

                    a prestigious a 10-year firm charter for two Platform Supply 
                    Vessels (PSV’s) by oil and gas major BP in Azerbaijan. KMNF 
                    is the marine support division of the State Oil Company of 
                    Azerbaijan Republic and with whom BUE has substantial 
                    ongoing relationship. The contract value is estimated to be 
                    in excess of OMR 40 million (equivalent US$103 million) over 
                    the contract period. BP has been a long-standing client of 
                    the company and this contract reaffirms their confidence in 
                    BUE’s commitment and capability.<br>
                    <br>
                    Under the terms of the agreement, the first new vessel will 
                    commence operations in Azerbaijan in the fourth quarter of 
                    2005 with the second vessel scheduled to commence operations 
                    during the third quarter of 2006. The two 72-meter, 5450 
                    BHP, dynamically positioned platform supply vessels will 
                    operate out of Baku, Azerbaijan and will support BP's 
                    offshore drilling, construction and production operations in 
                    the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. <br>
                    <br>
                    The vessels are currently under construction in shipyards in 
                    Norway and are being built to exacting European standards. 
                    The investment of OMR 15m (US$39 million) in the two modern 
                    vessels will help reinforce the BUE/KMNF position as the 
                    premier offshore fleet operator in the Caspian. <br>
                    <br>
                    BUE has an aggressive fleet expansion programme underway, 
                    with several new vessels scheduled to join the fleet over 
                    the next few months. The acquisition of BUE Marine Ltd. was 
                    completed during July 2005. BUE operates as part of Topaz 
                    Energy and Marine Ltd. (TEAM), which until recently, was 
                    listed on the MSM and has since been merged with 
                    RENAISSANCE. The combined TEAM/BUE fleet ranks among the 
                    top-ten offshore fleet operators worldwide with operations 
                    in the Caspian, Middle East, and South-East Asia.</font></p>

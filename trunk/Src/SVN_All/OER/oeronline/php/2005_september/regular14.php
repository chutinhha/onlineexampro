Securities Market (MSM), which is easing after the initial euphoria of Omantel 
listing</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
The markets continued to ease further during the period under review (24 July - 
20 August 2005) with very little activity observed in share trading except the 
Omantel scrip. In fact, right from the day of its listing on 28 August 2005, the 
market has been dominated by Omantel trading with almost 90 per cent of the 
value being attributed towards it. And before the share price got into a 
stabilization mode during the last days of the period under review, the 
correction continued to bring the Index down by around 200 points to close at 
5127 levels. Overall, the year to date gains is still at a healthy 52 per cent 
for the Index.<br>
<br>
<b>Omantel – The Buzz Word </b><br>
The traders and investors were all engrossed with Omantel scrip during the 
second fortnight of the period under review. The stock opened with a huge gap on 
its IPO price of RO1.280 at RO2.800, a very high gain of more than 115 per cent 
on its IPO price. However, profit taking took its toll over the next few days 
and along with the reducing volumes, the overall stock price bottomed out at 
around RO1.8, before stabilizing in the range of RO2.150 to RO2.250 (at the time 
of preparing this report).</font></p>

at the expense of MSM Stocks. However, given the drastic drop in the price, led to 
traders offloading their positions of the secondary market stocks to enter into 
the telecom stock. Many stalwart companies, especially in the banking and 
industry sectors were the top losers. This included banks like Bank Dhofar, Bank 
Muscat etc.; leasing companies like United Finance, Muscat Finance; industrial 
companies like Al Khaleej, National Aluminum, Al Jazeera Tube Mills and Oman 
National Dairy etc. <br>
<br>
There were services companies also which couldn’t sustain the profit booking on 
account of Omantel. Given the recent decrease in the share prices due to the 
Omantel listing, which has been more than 10 per cent from the top formed during 
the earlier period, we have tried to gauge whether the downturn has really taken 
off the gains made in the hay days of May-June’05 and if not, what were the 
stocks which were steady. Hence, we had taken two periods viz. <br>
<br>
1) During the brief but huge rally, took the Index up from 4650 levels to the 
high of 5700 levels. <br>
2) During the slowdown prior and after the Omantel listing which brought the MSM 
Index down to the current 5100 levels over a period of nearly two months.<br>
<br>
We have tried to analyze all the listed companies on MSM during the two periods. 
We have sorted on the basis on the gainers during the entire period.<br>
<br>
Gulf International Chemicals has been the largest gainer during the period under 
review, gaining during both the pre and post-Omantel period. Similarly, other 
prominent stocks include Gulf Investment Services, Fincorp, Global Financial 
Investments amongst the brokerage companies in the top gainers, while DIDIC and 
Oman &amp; Emirates, topped the investment sector. <br>
<br>
Banking sector was mixed with Bank Muscat notching the highest overall gain, 
inspite of its faltering down by 17 per cent during the post Omantel deluge to 
still maintain an effective gain of 21 per cent. Similar trend was observed with 
Oman International Bank and Bank Dhofar. However, National Bank of Oman was the 
odd one out with an effective negative gain during the period, inspite of 17 per 
cent during the initial run.<br>
<br>
<b>First Half 2005 Results – Still Making Headlines</b><br>
The corporate performance for the first half of 2005 remained healthy, with the 
overall earnings growth for the entire market growing by more than 30 per cent 
on a YoY basis. The largest gainer amongst the Indices in terms of corporate 
performance has been the banking and investment sector whose earnings have grown 
by a phenomenal 64 per cent on a YoY Basis. Even though, a large part of the 
earnings growth has been due to the holding companies including ONIC, Oman &amp; 
Emirates, DIDIC etc., the banking sector was also not far behind with Oman 
International Bank leading the pack with a 55 per cent jump in its profitability 
on a YoY basis. Following it was Bank Dhofar (26 per cent), Bank Muscat and 
Alliance Housing Bank (around 20 per cent resp.) The industry sector remained 
the second best with a modest 19 per cent increase, largely due to Oman Textiles 
which turned into profitability as against a loss. Other stocks were Oman Cement 
(25 per cent), Al Anwar Holding (50 per cent), Dhofar Cattlefeed (34 per cent). 
However, many of the other indices stocks in the industry faltered in their 
performance, as they couldn’t improve their revenues due to tough market 
conditions. <br>
<br>
<b>Outlook</b><br>
While the oil prices are going higher, the economic conditions are expected to 
become stronger and this favourable orientation would result in good corporate 
performance during the coming period. However, the stock markets at Oman and UAE 
have witnessed some correction taking place subsequent to June 2005 after 
reaching new heights. Such correction, even though difficult to comprehend for 
traders and investors, needs to be swallowed as a bitter pill as it eliminates 
the overweight of certain stocks beyond their fundamentals and ensures a matured 
approach in the stock prices in the long run. We believe that the investors are 
likely to proceed with caution but will be able to maintain their positions and 
interests in the stock market during the balance period in 2005.</font></p>

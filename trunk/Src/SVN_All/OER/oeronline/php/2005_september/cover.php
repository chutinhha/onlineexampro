            economic integration is still a distant dream. Akshay Bhatnagar 
            takes a reality check on the success of GCC so far and the 
            challenges ahead.</b><br>
            <br>
            The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) has entered its silver jubilee 
            year in 2005. The GCC, comprising of Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab 
            Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, was born in 1981 out of the 
            sheer need among the six Arab states to preserve their historical, 
            social and cultural bonding. But in the last 24 years, GCC has 
            gradually made giant strides towards marking its authority as a 
            regional economic bloc in the international market. Numbers of steps 
            have been taken to integrate the economies of the six member 
            countries; some initiatives have worked successfully, some have 
            boomeranged before seeing the light of the day and many are in the 
            pipeline. Let’s take a stock of each of them. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Monetary union</b><br>
            The biggest challenge, which the GCC is facing, is on the front of 
            monetary union (MU) of six member countries by 2010. Senior level 
            experts from the six countries are deliberating hard in assessing 
            the pros and cons of the eventual monetary union. <br>
            <br>
            On the positive side, the MU is expected to reduce foreign exchange 
            transaction costs, eliminate exchange rate risk, encourage pricing 
            transparency and lead to more competition. These will encourage 
            trade, investment and growth in the region. “With improved fiscal 
            discipline, inflation and interest rates would go down in the Gulf 
            region. At micro level, the single currency would have a long-term 
            impact on major regional banks by encouraging more efficient use of 
            cash. The costs of hedging against exchange rate volatility would be 
            reduced. The GCC MU would lead to the formation of the largest and 
            most liquid capital market in the Middle East. Portfolio managers 
            and private investors would be able to invest in the region without 
            any fear of additional currency risk,” forecasted a GCC analyst. <br>
            <br>
            But as a consequence of the MU, GCC countries fear that they will 
            lose their national sovereignty by relinquishing their independent 
            control over domestic monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies. 
            It might also lead to net loss in income, as they will not be able 
            to undertake expansionary monetary and fiscal policies whenever the 
            oil prices go down. Moreover, national budgetary policies of some of 
            the member countries could be subjected to arbitrary restrictions. 
            It could lead to breach of their control over their individual 
            taxation and public spending programs. The GCC countries are still 
            gauging the scale of expected losses and gains out of the MU. <br>
            <br>
            GCC has turned to European Union to advise it on framing up the 
            structure of the MU. Top-level GCC representatives are meeting next 
            year on January 12 to take the MU process forward. The creation of a 
            central bank will also be top of their agenda. The national banks of 
            the GCC countries are already permitted to operate in any part of 
            the region.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            <img border="1" src="fig1.jpg" width="291" height="174"></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            As the practice followed by all six GCC countries currently, the new 
            single GCC currency (its name yet to be identified) is expected to 
            be pegged to the US dollar. There have been speculations that GCC is 
            reconsidering whether to peg their single currency to the dollar or 
            even link it to a basket of leading currencies, including dollar and 
            euro. But refuting all rumours, Deputy Governor of the Saudi Arabian 
            Monetary Agency, Dr. Mohammed Al-Jasser said: “The GCC has not made 
            any decision yet on pegging the single Gulf currency, which is 
            expected to be put into effect in 2010.”<br>
            <br>
            Some of the economists are pushing for not pegging the currency to 
            any other currencies at all, thus making it a floating currency. The 
            arguments put forth in favour of the floating currency includes 
            reflection of market values, independence in policymaking and 
            insulation from being affected by the negative performance of other 
            currencies.<br>
            <br>
            GCC now needs to accelerate the process of MU as more than two 
            decades have already been spent deliberating on the issue. GCC had 
            initiated the move way back in 1982 when member countries had signed 
            an agreement, which said, &quot;The member states shall seek to 
            coordinate their financial, monetary and banking policies and 
            enhance cooperation between monetary agencies and central banks, 
            including an endeavor to establish a joint currency in order to 
            further their economies.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The GCC should be able to meet its target of 2010 to make MU a 
            reality as the move enjoys strong political backing. Besides that, 
            compared to other regional economic trade blocs, the six GCC 
            countries share similar macro economic structures; major exports 
            revenue comes from oil and gas sector; and focusing on 
            liberalization and diversification of the economy. On the flip side, 
            despite their best efforts over the years to align their economic 
            policies, the member countries still suffer from a large gap mainly 
            in budget deficits and public debt rates. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Stock market </b><br>
            As expected, the integration of stock markets of the six countries 
            is turning out to be a complex issue. Meeting its deadline of 
            completing the integration process by 2007 seems a daunting task for 
            GCC. As per information available, GCC is considering two options to 
            achieve the integration. The first is to merge all the stock markets 
            into a regional bourse.<br>
            <br>
            And the second is to connect them and set unified rules and 
            regulations to be followed by each of the six stock exchanges, which 
            will make it possible for the citizens of each country to trade in 
            stocks under the same rules. A ministerial level GCC meeting is 
            expected to discuss the issue before it is placed before the supreme 
            council of Gulf leaders for approval. <br>
            <br>
            The process of stock exchange integration is not going to be a 
            smooth process for all the member countries. The stock exchange 
            trading system followed by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain is 
            different from what is being followed by Kuwait and Oman. And there 
            is no uniformity also in the bourses in terms of the cap on foreign 
            investments. As per a stock exchange analyst, “While Qatar allows 25 
            per cent foreign investment in stocks but some countries permit up 
            to 49 per cent and some others none at all. This issue needs to be 
            addressed before the linkage is provided,” said a senior official of 
            Doha Stock Market. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Custom regulations</b><br>
            The unified custom regulation has been one of the most significant 
            achievements of GCC. The process began in 1983 with the 
            establishment of the Free Trade Area (FTA) among the GCC countries. 
            This meant elimination of tariffs on goods of national origins. This 
            single step alone led to a six-fold increase in trade volumes 
            between the GCC countries. Thereafter, in 80s and early 90s, the 
            efforts were made towards reaching an agreement on unified external 
            tariffs to pave the way for GCC Customs Union (CU). In January 2003, 
            the CU was implemented and the six member countries approved that 
            common customs tariff shall be 5 per cent on all foreign goods 
            imported from outside. This has resulted in 20 per cent increase in 
            inter-regional trade volume.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tourist Visa</b><br>
            GCC is very close to finalizing an agreement on implementing 
            ‘Unified Tourist Visa System’ which means that citizens of many 
            non-GCC countries will be able to travel between the GCC countries 
            by using a single visa issued by any of the six GCC countries. This 
            system is based on the similar visa system ‘Schenghen’ adopted in 
            European Union. The citizens of most of the North American and 
            European states are going to benefit majorly from this easy and 
            hassle free arrangement.<br>
            <br>
            Once implemented, the move is going to further accelerate the 
            tourism inflow in GCC countries as numbers of multi-billion dollar 
            tourism projects are fast developing in the region. <br>
            <br>
            The hospitality sector, including hotels, airlines, travel agencies 
            and tour operators etc., along with retail players, are pressing for 
            its early implementation. “If a business tourist is visiting Dubai, 
            with a unified tourist visa, he can visit Oman to enjoy its tourist 
            attractions in his spare time. He can maximize his gains from the 
            single trip,” said a Muscat based travel agency manager. <br>
            <br>
            As per estimates, the global tourism market is expected to be $300 
            billion and growing at 12 per cent per annum. The move is expected 
            to boost GCC’s share in international tourism, as member countries 
            will benefit from promotional programmes undertaken by various 
            tourism authorities besides presenting the whole region as an 
            integrated tourism destination.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Smart ID cards</b><br>
            GCC General Secretariat has advised its member countries to issue 
            smart cards to their citizens at a faster pace. “We have given 
            member states a deadline before which they should all complete their 
            national identity card schemes. Most of the member states have gone 
            a long way in their programmes and I think they will meet the 
            deadline,&quot; Colonel Rashid Salim&nbsp; Al Muhairi, Director of 
            Security Department at the GCC General Secretariat informed. </font></p>
            <p align="center">
            <img border="1" src="fig2.jpg" width="300" height="210"><br>
            <br>
            <img border="1" src="fig3.jpg" width="300" height="217"></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
            The unified smart cards would facilitate easy travel for the GCC 
            citizens irrespective of their nationality within the six GCC 
            countries. Once the unified smart card system is fully operational, 
            GCC citizens will not be required to stand in queue with their 
            passports. With the smart card, they will be able to enter and exit 
            any GCC country easily. The citizens of some of the GCC countries 
            are already traveling in other GCC countries by using their national 
            identity cards under bilateral agreements.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The smart card will be used as a multi-purpose card. It will be 
            used as an identity card, a driving license, a health card, for bank 
            dealings and at border outlets, etc,&quot; Col. Muhairi added. The size 
            of the card remains same for citizens of all six countries but each 
            country has the liberty to choose its own unique colour (may be from 
            their respective national flags). The card will carry the emblem of 
            the respective country besides the GCC emblem. The expatriates too 
            will be issued the same cards but with certain restrictions.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Railway system</b><br>
            With railway networks getting preference over road transportation 
            world over, GCC member countries have also taken up a project ‘Arab 
            Railway Network Project’ which is aimed at connecting them through 
            an extensive railway network The rail network is going to increase 
            the exchange of goods and trade activities in the region and make it 
            easy for the GCC citizens to move from one country to another. <br>
            <br>
            While the process for the final planning of the project is still 
            going on but most of the member countries have agreed in principle 
            to support the project. In the past there had been few oppositions 
            to the project over its impact on the environment, especially to 
            marine and wild life. But keeping in view the long-term economic 
            benefits of the project, GCC is looking at it on a positive note. A 
            special committee comprising of GCC representatives is conducting a 
            study to evaluate the feasibility of the project. The railway 
            network would further increase trade activities in the region. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Power grid </b><br>
            GCC is expected to begin the construction work on the first phase of 
            the multi-billion dollar GCC power grid project in September this 
            year. The project aims at interconnecting Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
            Bahrain and Qatar to reduce the cost of generating power. The GCC 
            Power Grid Authority, made up of representatives from all Gulf 
            countries, is based in Dammam. <br>
            <br>
            As per a GCC Secretariat statement, “The four Gulf states - Saudi 
            Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar - will be interconnected by the 
            year 2008; the whole grid project will be completed by 2010. The 
            appointment of a panel to supervise the GCC power grid project was 
            the final step toward project implementation, and that means a big 
            step forward for economic integration throughout the Gulf region. 
            Upon the completion of phase one, the total cost savings rate of 
            return after four years from operations could be $2.5 billion.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            The huge power-grid linkage project is expected to save the Gulf 
            countries billions of dollars through efficient management of power 
            production and distribution. The idea to set up a central power grid 
            is significant as the investment in linking of the GCC power grids 
            would be less than establishing and maintaining multiple power 
            generation plants in individual countries in the region. This will 
            also ensure regular power supply to the industrial units mushrooming 
            all over the Gulf countries, thus leadi<img border="0" src="fig4.jpg" width="177" height="111" align="right">ng towards boosting their 
            industrial productivity. The GCC countries raking in surplus power 
            will be able to sell it to those countries, which are suffering from 
            power shortages. <br>
            <br>
            With infrastructure development in full swing in the GCC region, the 
            demand for power is growing at an alarming rate. Some of the 
            industrial zones and residential townships are facing low occupancy 
            on account of shortage of power. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
            alone, the power consumption is growing at a rate of 5.5 per cent 
            annually. And as per market estimates, the Kingdom needs to invest 
            $375 billion in the next 20-years to meet the rise in its power 
            consumption. </font></p>

            <b>Traffic law</b><br>
            The GCC member countries are very close to adopting a unified 
            traffic law in the next three years. A unified GCC traffic law was 
            proposed a few years back but GCC members were not able to reach a 
            consensus on the final plan. But the draft has been revised and 
            submitted again for consent from the member countries. In fact, some 
            of the countries have already incorporated certain clauses from the 
            earlier draft in their local traffic laws. <br>
            <br>
            Once implemented, the new unified traffic law is expected to reduce 
            the road accidents rate. As per the new law, a GCC citizen will not 
            be required to pay traffic fine in a member state other than his 
            home country. For example, if an Omani citizen commits a traffic 
            violation in the UAE, he can pay the fine in Oman later on. In a 
            recent meeting of the GCC, the officials also discussed phasing out 
            leaded petrol by 2007.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Roadblocks</b><br>
            An important issue, which creates tension among the member 
            countries, is political in nature. It relates to the border 
            disputes. The failure of the respective governments to resolve their 
            border disputes leads to either delay or non-implementation of major 
            regional infrastructure development projects like bridges, railway 
            network and electricity grids. Many a time the benefits of a project 
            in one country fail to touch the lives of citizens of its 
            neighbouring countries due to the prevailing border tensions. <br>
            <br>
            Despite making striking gains in the recent past, GCC has tough task 
            up its sleeves, as member countries have not been able to completely 
            resolve their differences, which are affecting the progress of the 
            economic integration front. Take the case of customs union. The 
            customs union agreement suffered a jolt when the UAE refused to sign 
            an accord barring bilateral trade deals except with the United 
            States. While one section of the GCC believes that bilateral 
            agreements violate the GCC tariff pact, the other section believes 
            there should be some flexibility to sign bilateral agreements with 
            non-GCC countries in their strategic national interests. Many of the 
            GCC countries are negotiating for such bilateral agreements with 
            many countries. As per sources, Qatar is in talks with Singapore, 
            Oman is negotiating with India and the UAE is looking at a deal with 
            Australia.<br>
            <br>
            A policy mechanism needs to be worked out to avoid such kinds of 
            disputes on a permanent basis rather than dealing with them on a 
            case-to-case basis. <br>
            <br>
            Despite differences on some of the issues related to taking GCC 
            economic integration forward, GCC member countries are most likely 
            to achieve monetary union by 2010 and resolve most of the matters 
            related to it. <br>
            <br>
            History has proved that countries with similarities in their 
            economic structures and systems are more likely to succeed as a 
            unified economic bloc. Most of the GCC countries have similar 
            economies as oil exports are their main source of revenue and they 
            all want to diversify to cut their dependence on oil. All the six 
            GCC countries follow the same religion, language and traditions. 
            They have enjoyed the inherited wealth so far but it’s time to 
            jointly build the evolutionary wealth! </font></p>

                <b>GCC’s Economic Power<br>
                </b></font><br>
                High oil prices and production should ensure a sustained 
                economic boom in the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation 
                Council (GCC) - Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, 
                Qatar and Saudi Arabia - according to a regional economic report 
                prepared by the Washington based Institute of International 
                Finance (IIF), the global association of financial institutions.<br>
                <br>
                IIF Managing Director Charles Dallara noted that, &quot;The GCC is in 
                the midst of a period of exceptional economic performance. We 
                are now forecasting aggregate GDP to expand by more than 
                one-third for 2005 and 2006, while foreign assets are estimated 
                to rise in these two years by more than $360 billion.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                The IIF stated that economic activity in the GCC was strong in 
                2004 and it estimated that aggregate nominal GDP growth was 17.6 
                per cent, after an expansion of 15.1 per cent in 2003.<br>
                <br>
                Dallara pointed out that, &quot;High oil prices have facilitated 
                increases in government spending and bolstered confidence, 
                stimulating a surge in activity in the non-hydrocarbon sectors. 
                While we have seen similar trends in the past, the current cycle 
                now appears to be having more dynamic effects across the region. 
                This reflects a number of key developments, including increased 
                intra-regional capital flows, as reflected in a property boom 
                and a run-up in equity prices; rapid rises in tourism in some 
                countries; and a region-wide acceleration in project 
                implementation. We now estimate that spending on projects this 
                year and next will rise at least fourfold over the $35 billion 
                seen in such investments in 2002-2003.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Howard Handy, IIF Director for the Middle East and Africa, 
                stated that the IIF anticipates that oil export revenues are 
                likely to rise by 49 per cent to $291 billion in 2005 and inch 
                up to $305 billion in 2006. By way of comparison, revenues from 
                oil exports were just $61 billion in 1998 and averaged under 
                $100 billion for the ten years to 2003. Saudi Arabia's oil 
                export revenue between 2004 and 2006 is forecast to be greater 
                than that for the whole of the 1990s. He said, &quot;Growth in gas 
                exports is even more dramatic, as we projected that export 
                revenue from this source in 2006 ($21.1 billion) will be almost 
                four times greater that the 1994-2003 average.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Handy added that, &quot;We envisage oil prices, measured in terms of 
                Brent Crude per barrel, averaging about $54 this year and $55 
                next year. Our estimates suggest that even if there is a sharp 
                decline, the GCC governments can cut back on spending and 
                mobilize substantial external assets.&quot; <br>
                <br>
                Dallara pointed out that the new report stressed that, 
                &quot;Political rather than economic events pose the greatest risk to 
                our forecast, as it would take a dramatic downturn in the oil 
                price to jeopardize the healthy economic outlook. While 
                terrorism is a constant issue and concern, it has had little 
                impact on the GCC's economies to date.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Aggregate GDP for the GCC is expected to rise by 24.8 per cent 
                in 2005 and 7.5 per cent in 2006, to a total of $627 billion in 
                2006.<br>
                <br>
                Non-hydrocarbon exports will principally be in the form of 
                re-exports with the UAE continuing to be the main center for 
                re-exports in the region, owing to its world class ports, though 
                Kuwait will play a growing role because of the ongoing 
                infrastructure development in neighboring Iraq. Other 
                non-hydrocarbon exports are also expected to perform well, owing 
                to the increases in manufacturing output, though they will 
                account for only around 7 per cent of total exports.<br>
                <br>
                Aggregate GCC exports are forecast at $391 billion in 2005 and 
                $416 billion in 2006, similar to the combined total for Brazil, 
                India and Russia, according to IIF estimates. Stripping out 
                re-exports and intra regional trade, the IIF expects exports to 
                exceed $350 billion in 2006. Rapid economic development and the 
                implementation of infrastructure and industrial projects are 
                expected to cause a surge in imports of capital goods. The 
                growing wealth of the population is also likely to lift consumer 
                goods imports. In IT alone, GCC is expected to spend $5 billion 
                in 2005 with Saudi Arabia having 46.8 per cent share and the UAE 
                30.4 per cent with the remaining GCC members’ shares in single 
                digits. With so much investment in IT, the PC penetration in the 
                GCC is set to double by 2008. Overall, at $246 billion in 2005 
                and $253 billion in 2006, the trade surplus will exceed 40 per 
                cent of GDP.</font></td>

                </font></b><br>
                In respect of Oman, GCC member countries continue to be the 
                major trading partners, accounting for about 50.2 per cent of 
                Oman’s total non-oil exports (45 per cent in 2003), and about 35 
                per cent of imports (28 per cent in 2003).<br>
                <br>
&nbsp;The rising share in 
                respect of both exports and imports suggest that the process of 
                closer trade integration with GCC members is moving ahead. 
                Notwithstanding the healthy progress on trade with the GCC 
                members as a group, two notable aspects of this development 
                could be that: (a) export and import markets of Oman may be less 
                diversified at the global level, and (b) within the GCC group 
                also, there is a tendency for greater concentration in favour of 
                the UAE. During 2004, the share of the UAE in total imports of 
                Oman from GCC group and total non-oil exports of Oman to GCC 
                group turned out to be 92.6 per cent and 74.2 per cent, 
                respectively (as against 77.6 per cent and 72.4 per cent in 
                2003). Such concentration, however, reflects the consistently

                <b>His Excellency Engineer Salem Said Al-Ghattami, President of 
                Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, talks to OER on the 
                role of the private sector in the GCC economic integration</b><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What is the role of the private sector in the economic 
                development of the GCC countries? </b> <br>
                GCC countries are making great efforts to ensure that the 
                respective Government bodies and private sector players work in 
                tandem for development and progress. These efforts are showing 
                good results as the private sector’s contribution to the economy 
                has gone up significantly. As a result, the GCC countries’ 
                economic dependence on oil products has been reduced. More 
                investments in such private sector initiatives would further 
                accelerate the diversification process. <br>
                <br>
                Generally speaking, there are still some obstacles for 
                international and local investors who are looking to invest in 
                the region. In such a scenario, the Government’s role as an 
                investor – to encourage and sustain the private sector’s new 
                projects – becomes very crucial. The needs and requirements of 
                the private sector are growing constantly due to the local, 
                national and international developments. Therefore, the 
                Government’s financial support needs to be enhanced to help the 
                private sector increase its own investment and economic 
                activities. <br>
                <br>
                The introduction of the customs union is an indication of the 
                seriousness of the GCC countries to meet the private sector’s 
                requirements. GCC countries are proceeding towards the 
                establishment of GCC monetary union by 2010. All these strategic 
                decisions show GCC countries’ interest in developing and 
                improving the private sector and related infrastructures. 
                Private sector is the main priority of the GCC countries because 
                they realize its importance and effectiveness in the growth of 
                the economy. <br>
                <br>
                <b>What has been the impact of customs union on the private sector 
                in GCC region? </b> <br>
                The decision to go for a customs union for imported goods has 
                been a wise and strategic one for the GCC countries. It has 
                helped in the unification of the commercial dealings with the 
                international market. It has had a very positive impact while 
                dealing with other regional blocs and countries, including the 
                European Union, Japan and the US etc. <br>
                <br>
                Besides this, the GCC customs union has also boosted commercial 
                deals within the Arab countries. Dealing with one united customs 
                law is better then dealing with six different customs laws in 
                six different markets. The customs unification is going to 
                immensely benefit the growth of commerce and industry in the GCC.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What are your expectations from the monetary union of GCC by 
                2010? </b> <br>
                One united currency for all GCC countries is our main goal. It’s 
                going to be a new era for the GCC countries. This will unify 
                Gulf countries strongly and will give them a single economic 
                identity. Establishing a common currency will be a very 
                significant development for the GCC countries. <br>
                <br>
                The setting up of a monetary union will have several benefits: 
                economic well being of citizens, unified economic policies, 
                networking of essential infrastructures, joint ventures, unified 
                rules and regulations and a commonality that will eventually 
                lead to the establishment of single representative in both 
                regional and international assemblies. <br>
                <br>
                <b>How is the private sector contributing to the economic 
                development in Oman?</b><br>
                The private sector has played a very effective role in the 
                economic development of Oman. It has led to the increase in the 
                national income and investments in the manufacturing and service 
                sectors. The private sector has generated employment for the 
                Omani youth and given them the opportunity to shore up their 
                living standards.<br>
                <br>
                In the next phase of development, enhancement and promotion of 
                investments in the Sultanate requires the joint efforts of both 
                the public and private sectors, especially the promoting 
                officials. These officials are the first interface for the 
                investment community, as they meet the investors; understand 
                their aspirations, ambitions, obstacles and problems they face 
                with the government bodies. The problems faced by the investment 
                community in the first stage itself should be solved to prevent 
                any obstacles and formation of any negative impression.<br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, investment promotion should be done in a 
                scientific framework. The responsible officials should study the 
                countries that have the capacity and inclination to invest in 
                countries like Oman. They should be approached and apprised of 
                the investment opportunities in Sultanate of Oman.</font></td>

                <br>
                <b>How is the GCC shaping up as an economic bloc? </b> <br>
                Economic integration between GCC member states is moving ahead 
                steadily according to clear timetables and workable programs. 
                This solid economic base has made the GCC a viable and vigorous 
                economic bloc. The integration process is moving along all key 
                tracks: the customs union, the common market, the monetary 
                union, as well as the harmonization of trade, industry, 
                development and oil policies. <br>

                <br>
                What is the combined share of GCC countries in the world trade?</b><br>
                As for GCC share in the world economy, and despite the GCC’s 
                small size in terms of total population, its GDP is now over 
                $400 billion, more than half the GDP of the region. Its trade 
                with the rest of the world is in excess of $300 billion. As an 
                indicator for its integration in the world economy, GCC trade as 
                share of GDP is close to 80 per cent, one of the highest rates 
                in the world.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What are the major imports and exports of GCC region? </b> <br>
                The main GCC exports are obviously oil, gas and petrochemicals, 
                which account for over 90 per cent of GCC exports. Some of our 
                member states also export aluminum, fish and agricultural 
                products, but these are small compared to oil and gas exports.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What are the unique features of GCC’s unified tariff system? How 
                is it benefiting the member countries? </b> <br>
                The main features of the GCC customs union, which was launched 
                in 2003, include a low and simple external tariff of 5 per cent 
                for most goods. The only exception is some 417 basic goods, 
                which are exempted from customs tariffs. Our member states 
                agreed to this relatively low rate in order to benefit the 
                citizens and residents of the GCC on the one hand, and encourage 
                trade with the rest of the world. By removing high tariffs, the 
                GCC member states demonstrated their willingness to encourage 
                trade with the rest of the world. <br>
                <br>
                <b>How does the GCC plan to meet threats like some GCC member 
                countries signing bilateral trade deals with non-GCC countries?</b><br>
                The GCC member states are determined not to let bilateral trade 
                agreements interfere with the smooth working of the GCC customs 
                union and are working to make them consistent with its 
                requirements.<br>

                <b>On the smart card front for citizens, what is the deadline for 
                the GCC countries to issue the cards and what are going to be 
                its benefits? </b> <br>
                When the idea of the smart card was approved in the May 2004 
                consultative meeting of the GCC heads of state, the member 
                states were given two years to complete the process of adoption 
                of the card. Preparations are well under way in all member 
                states to issue the smart card. The smart card will make it 
                easier for GCC citizens to benefit from the GCC common market 
                agreement, which makes it possible for them to move easily and 
                reside in all member states on equal footing, as well as engage 
                in most economic activities and take advantage of social, health 
                and educational services. <br>

                <b>What progress has been made on the creation of the railway 
                network connecting GCC countries?</b><br>
                The GCC railways network is in the study phase. An initial 
                pre-feasibility study has shown that the project is worthwhile. 
                A full feasibility study is currently going on. This is the 
                stage we are now in. After the economic feasibility is 
                completed, member states will decide on the next steps. In their 
                latest meeting in June 2005, GCC ministers of transport 
                authorized the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Transport to prepare a 
                request for proposal document for the study while a technical 
                committee of GCC experts has been formed to supervise it.<br>

                What are your estimates of oil revenues of the GCC countries in 
                2005? How is it going to impact the strengthening of GCC 
                economic bloc? </b> <br>
                I will leave the estimates of oil revenue this year to the 
                experts, especially since we still have several months to go 
                before the end of the year, but it is clear so far that oil 
                revenues this year are going to be quite high. All GCC member 
                states have very ambitious projects, some under way, to channel 
                the extra revenues in order to strengthen their economies. This 
                will certainly provide great opportunities for the private 
                sector, both national and foreign, to carry out these plans.<br>

                six GCC countries?</b><br>
                GCC stock markets are growing by the day. As you probably know, 
                the total capitalization increased by over 400 per cent over the 
                past four years. At the beginning of this year, it exceeded $530 
                billion. Since then, it has grown by nearly 50 per cent. GCC 
                countries have some of the largest stock markets in the region. 
                A study had been commissioned by the GCC for the further 
                development and integration of GCC stock markets. The study was 
                completed recently by an international consulting group and a 
                technical committee has been meeting to formulate 
                recommendations to achieve the goals.<br>

                <b>What is the total value of foreign trade done by GCC? And what 
                has been the progress on the intra regional trade in GCC?</b><br>
                In 2003, GCC trade with the rest of the world reached about $280 
                billion in value, and it increased to about $313 billion in 
                2004. Trade between member states has exceeded $21 billion 
                dollars during 2003, up by 20 per cent from the previous year, 
                as a result of the launch of the GCC customs union. Because most 
                GCC member states produce and export oil, there is only limited 
                trade in oil between them. However, the share of intra-GCC trade 
                in the total non-oil trade is quite high, reaching over 40 per 
                cent in some cases. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Do you think border disputes are affecting the inter-regional 
                infrastructure development projects in GCC?</b><br>
                Differences of opinion over details of borderlines between 
                neighboring countries are common all over the world. Our member 
                states have been working hard to define these technical details 
                of their borders with their neighbors, whether GCC member states 
                or not. This process takes time and it does not affect the 
                brotherly relations between our member states, which share a lot 
                more than geography. At the same time, the GCC as an 
                organization is a proof that our member states are committed to 
                full integration and removing or reducing all barriers that 
                could delay this integration.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What steps have been taken so far to establish GCC power grid?</b><br>
                The GCC heads of state adopted the power grid project and 
                authorized the creation of the Power Grid Organization, a 
                specialized agency of the GCC that works under the supervision 
                and guidance of GCC ministerial committees. The organization, 
                which is based in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, is fully functioning. 
                Briefly, the project has two phases: the first is intended to 
                connect Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, and the second 
                will connect Oman and the UAE to the other four. Both groups are 
                currently making great efforts to reach the level of readiness 
                needed for the grid to be completed.<br>
                <br>
                <b>How far has the GCC moved in the direction of a single currency 
                by 2010? </b> <br>
                The GCC Supreme Council has approved a clear timetable to 
                achieve a monetary union and launch a unified currency by 
                January 2010. The ministerial committees have adopted interim 
                deadlines to achieve that and we are on schedule. According to 
                the timetable, GCC member states are to reach agreement on 
                “convergence criteria” for the unified currency. We already have 
                agreement in principle on these criteria. As you know, agreement 
                on these criteria is a crucial point in any monetary union, as 
                was clear in the history of the European Monetary Union. As for 
                the anchor of the unified currency, no decision has been made on 
                that regard. In the meantime, GCC currencies have all being 
                pegged to the US dollar as a way of fixing their cross exchange 
                rates.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What development has been made on forming alliances like free 
                trade zones etc. with other regional trade blocks such as 
                European Union?</b><br>
                With the launch of the customs union and unification of customs 
                rules and regulations in GCC member states, trade negotiations 
                between the GCC and its trading partners should move more 
                quickly and smoothly. The GCC has collectively concluded 
                economic cooperation and trade agreement with several trading 
                partners, including China, India, Pakistan, Turkey, and the 
                Mercosur Group (Mercosur is a regional trading bloc formed in 
                March 1991, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and 
                Uruguay. In 1996, Chile and Bolivia joined as associate 
                members). We have recently signed FTA agreements with Lebanon 
                and Syria. As for the European Union, which is our number one 
                trading partner, we are near to signing a full free trade area 
                agreement, to replace the economic cooperation agreement the two 
                sides signed in 1988.<br>
                <br>
                <b>When is the GCC expected to introduce a unified visa system? 
                What are going to be the unique features of the system?</b><br>
                For a number of years now, technical committees working under 
                the guidance of the GCC ministers of interior have been working 
                to devise a unified visa system for non-GCC citizens; to 
                implement the GCC resolutions regarding this issue, and to 
                facilitate movement of non-GCC citizens between member states. 
                The main idea is to grant a unified visa to visit all six-member 
                states. Already, in implementation of the Supreme Council 
                resolutions, special attention has been given to non-GCC 
                citizens who have established residency in any member state to 
                travel with very few restrictions between member states. Special 
                rules have also been introduced to facilitate travel by 
                commercial drivers and company representatives within GCC.</font></td>

                <b>In an open discussion with Akshay Bhatnagar, His Excellency 
                Dr.Abdulmalik A. Al-Hinai, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, 
                Ministry of National Economy, talks about the complexities 
                involved in the integration of GCC countries and its impact on 
                Oman’s economy</b><br>
                <br>
                <b>How is the GCC shaping up as a regional economic bloc?</b><br>
                We have come a long way in the last 20 years or so. Perhaps the 
                most important move in the integration of GCC member countries’ 
                economies is the customs union. This giant stride along with a 
                number of other initiatives is going to lead us to the formation 
                of a common market. <br>
                <br>
                To be honest, there are lots of obstacles within GCC fold before 
                it could emerge as a strong economic bloc. For example, we are 
                still grappling with the issues related to customs union. Border 
                checkpoints are a major problem. The issue is affecting exports 
                from Oman. Some GCC countries are yet to remove specific 
                regulations that hinder the smooth flow of trade between GCC 
                member countries. The GCC committee is trying to resolve this 
                problem. <br>
                <br>
                In fact, different committees under the GCC banner meet 
                regularly to discuss and solve the problems among the member 
                countries. As you know, the GCC has taken a decision to reach a 
                monetary union by 2010. I believe we need to do a lot of work 
                before we can successfully reach this stage. <br>
                <br>
                We have been closely monitoring other regional economic blocs, 
                especially European Union, where the common currency, Euro, has 
                caused some resentment in certain quarters. There are lessons to 
                be learnt from the evolution of other blocs. We should be 
                cautious while taking steps towards the economic integration and 
                should take into consideration many dimensions related to it. We 
                need to harmonize our economic policies more before reaching a 
                monetary union. The process should not be revolutionary; instead 
                it should be evolutionary. <br>
                <br>
                <b>… but don’t you think GCC economic integration should be done at 
                a faster pace?</b><br>
                Yes, we need to take more action on this front. But as I said we 
                must take firm steps by learning from the experience of other 
                blocs. We must not repeat the mistakes committed by others. We 
                must move one step at a time. For example, before we accelerate 
                further on economic integration, we must make the customs union 
                work more effectively. The GCC countries should facilitate 
                exchange of goods more smoothly and must refrain from creating 
                any administrative stumbling blocs that affect trade between 
                member countries. <br>
                <br>
                The private sector players in each of the GCC countries should 
                accelerate the process by developing close ties with each other. 
                They should form more joint alliances and invest in other GCC 
                markets to give momentum to the process initiated by the 
                Governments of the GCC countries. They should give constructive 
                feedback on the economic policies to help in ascertaining their 
                effectiveness. <br>
                <br>
                <b>What are the lessons that GCC needs to learn from the experience 
                of other economic blocs?</b><br>
                The lessons are that we should not be emotional in our approach. 
                We should be practical and pragmatic. We shouldn’t allow 
                obstacles to affect the economic integration process. We should 
                look for solutions for any problem. All GCC members understand 
                that more economic integration will serve the interests of their 
                respective national economies. <br>
                <br>
                Therefore, there should be clarity and transparency in their 
                interaction with each other. All of us should take cue from 
                other blocs like the EU and ASEAN. Every member should be 
                treated equally and all of us should respect each other’s 
                interests. <br>
                <b>
                <br>
                What is the role envisaged for Oman in the GCC economic bloc?</b><br>
                Oman has always been very supportive of the GCC economic 
                integration. With our unique location, Oman is a natural gateway 
                to GCC for the outside world. We have been constantly upgrading 
                our infrastructure, including roads network, airports and 
                seaports to facilitate smooth flow of goods from Oman to other 
                GCC countries. <br>
                <br>
                Oman is blessed with relatively more population compared to many 
                other GCC countries. Our recent policy initiatives are targeted 
                at development of human resources on a much larger scale. This 
                will lead to the integration of the labour market in the GCC. 
                Already, a large number of skilled and semi-skilled Omanis are 
                employed in other GCC countries. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Do we give any special preference for importing and exporting 
                goods from GCC countries?</b><br>
                We operate in an open, global, competitive market. We don’t give 
                any special treatment to exports and imports from GCC countries 
                for the sole reason that they are from the GCC bloc. The World 
                Trade Organization regulations don’t permit such liberties. 
                Moreover, the market efficiency demands that we opt for the most 
                competitive option available in the global market.<br>
                <br>
                However, GCC countries are the major trading partners of Oman. 
                Most of Omani products are exported to the UAE and Saudi Arabia. 
                The trade among GCC countries is growing every year. Much of the 
                credit goes to the customs union that has facilitated relatively 
                easy flow of goods between the GCC countries. <br>
                <br>
                <b>What is the impact of GCC economic integration on Omani economy?</b><br>
                We believe that all GCC members are benefiting from the economic 
                integration. Oman is no exception. Take tourism for example. The 
                co-operation among GCC members to facilitate movement of 
                tourists between GCC countries is going to boost Omani economy, 
                as more tourists will come to Oman. <br>
                <br>
                <b>GCC is facing challenges like border disputes or bilateral trade 
                agreements signed by GCC countries with non-GCC countries. How 
                is GCC dealing with such sensitive issues? </b> <br>
                As far as Oman is concerned, we have no border dispute with any 
                country. The issue of bilateral trade agreements has been 
                discussed at various forums within the GCC. And the GCC members 
                have agreed that they can sign bilateral agreements with one or 
                two countries. Some countries had expressed concern that their 
                national interests demand that they sign such agreements. The 
                national interests of a country could also be based on its 
                overall economic, security or strategic concerns besides just 
                trade activities. <br>
                For your information, as a regional bloc, GCC is negotiating 
                with EU, China and Turkey; and signed agreements with Lebanon 
                and Syria. <br>
                <br>
                <b>But don’t you think bilateral trade agreements are going to harm 
                the interests of the GCC bloc?</b><br>
                I don’t think that bilateral trade agreements will harm the GCC 
                bloc. All these agreements are based on specific negotiations 
                and are not done on dictated terms. They take care of the 
                national interests of the involved countries. <br>
                <br>
                For example, our negotiations with China are based on the 
                consideration that China is a big economy with plenty of 
                comparative advantages. Once we mutually agree on negotiated 
                terms, some of the Omani products will get access to the vast 
                Chinese market and similarly Chinese can tap our market for 
                strategic investments and training services. We will try our 
                best to get the best deal for Oman and GCC market from China.

                <b>In a regional trade bloc, some of the member countries have to 
                sacrifice their national interests in favour of the larger 
                regional interests. How far is Oman prepared to make such 
                sacrifices?</b><br>
                Oman has made sacrifices in the larger interests of the GCC 
                bloc. We started development process quite late in Oman compared 
                to many of our neighbours. We had to forego some of our 
                interests in the short term but we have benefited in the long 
                term. So we are prepared to make the sacrifices but every GCC 
                country has to take its share of the burden.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What sacrifices have been made by Oman for GCC?</b><br>
                We didn’t protect our industries in the beginning. We know that 
                there are other countries in the GCC that are subsidizing some 
                of their industries. May be they are not subsidizing them 
                directly but they have made available utilities like electricity 
                and water at cheaper rates. We can’t afford to do that because 
                we don’t have lot of oil revenue like some other members. We 
                opened our markets to GCC products and our industries suffered 
                for a certain period. But later, we managed to recover and 
                today, we are a tough competitor to beat in our business.</font></td>

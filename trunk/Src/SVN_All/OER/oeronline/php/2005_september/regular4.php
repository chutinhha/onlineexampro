new B-Class - the Compact Sports Tourer from Mercedes-Benz, combines the 
advantages of different vehicle concepts and provides an exciting design, 
generous space, exemplary comfort, excellent practicality and a high level of 
driving pleasure. Four up-to-date petrol engines and two high torque CDI diesel 
engines with outputs ranging from 95 hp to 193 hp help the Sports Tourer 
generate effortless performance. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">It boasts of 
a unique arrangement of the engine and transmission which is partly in front of 
and partly beneath the passenger cell along with adaptive two-stage front 
airbags, active head restraints, newly developed head/thorax side-bags, 
electromechanical power steering system, improved Electronic Stability Program 
and a suspension with selective damping system, ensuring outstanding levels of 
safety, typical of a Mercedes-Benz. Besides the use of high-quality materials 
and extensive standard appointments, the new B-Class offers a wide range of 
optional equipment, which further enhances the comfort and the driving 
experience in the new Compact Sports Tourer. Its price starts from RO9,995. 
Mercedes-AMG has also produced the most powerful non-turbo charged production 
engine in the world. The new high revving AMG 6.3 litre V8 engine has an output 
of 510hp at 6800 rpm with a maximum torque of 630 Nm. Thanks to its large 
displacement, the new engine develops around 20 per cent more torque compared to 
naturally aspirated engines in its class.&nbsp;</font></p>

success. It is essential to combine the strengths of DaimlerChrysler with those 
of the suppliers in order to achieve a top-class value-added partnership.” The 
key criteria for this year's commendations against which Shell Lubricants was

developed a new electro-deposition basecoat – known as e-coating – that 
substantially reduces both volatile organic compounds (VOC) and carbon dioxide

e-coating efficiently adheres paint to metal surfaces and raises the rust 
protection quality of Mazda vehicles. With the introduction of Three Layer 
paining system and the new e-coating process, Mazda is aiming to go greener in 
its manufacturing policies and also improve the rust protection quality of its 
vehicles. By employing these two technologies, Mazda’s painting process has 
advanced to a new level of eco-friendliness. Mazda is brought to Oman by Towell

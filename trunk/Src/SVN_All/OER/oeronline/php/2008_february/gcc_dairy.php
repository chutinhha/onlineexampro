        <b>The significant issuance and new rating activity herald the market’s 
        next stage of expansion and maturity, comments Moody’s Investors Service 
        in its special report ‘Arabian Gulf Corporate Bond Market: 2007 Review 
        and 2008 Outlook’ </b><br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="gcc1.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" vspace="8">Buoyed by high liquidity from record oil and gas prices, the Middle East 
        and Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) region, in particular, experienced a 
        break-through year as far as the gradual establishment of a liquid and 
        rated corporate bond market was concerned. Both conventional and Islamic 
        (Sukuk) financing flourished in equal measure, showing only some 
        softening in the latter part of 2007 on the back of less attractive 
        global market conditions. Moody’s expects much of this pent-up supply to 
        come to market in early 2008, although much will depend on market 
        recovery. Total corporate bond issuance in the GCC (excluding project 
        and structured finance) reached US$23.7 billion close to year-end 2007, 
        of which US$11.7 billion was Sukuk, thus comfortably surpassing 2006 
        issuance levels of US$14.6 billion, including US$9 billion in Sukuk. 
        Moody’s believes that the near-term market potential could be up to 
        US$50 billion.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Record issuance despite soft landing </b><br>
        Development of a deep, rated corporate bond market continued in 2007, 
        with debt increasingly being the primary source of growth financing. 
        Total bond issuance in the GCC reached US$47.8 billion in 2007, with 
        corporate issuance now representing every second dollar issued. 
        Corporate issuance rose more than 62 per cent to US$23.7 billion, with 
        this figure likely to have reached US$30-35 billion, if the markets had 
        not deteriorated in the final quarter. Issuance across both conventional 
        and Shari’ah-compliant bonds (Sukuk) was evenly strong, with both 
        representing fairly equal shares of the market. Sukuk was driven both by 
        large investor appetite and liquidity for Islamic instruments, and 
        regional ambitions to develop centres for a Shari’ah-compliant secondary 
        market. Here, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) is 
        emerging more and more as the primary hub, with over US$16 billion of 
        Sukuk listed at the year-end.<br>
        <br>
        The year 2007 saw Moody’s rate its first corporate Sukuk, the US$650 
        million Ijara Sukuk issued on behalf of Saad Trading Contracting &amp; 
        Financial Services Company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This was soon 
        followed by more than US$6 billion of additional rated Shari’ah-compliant 
        transactions, with benchmark issuances by both DP World, DIFC 
        Investments and Jebel Ali Free Zone, the latter representing the first 
        company to issue in domestic currency on a large scale. Equally 
        significant, the proportion of rated versus unrated issuers has 
        increased exponentially, with close to 54 per cent of total 2007 
        issuance (including issuers first rated before 2007) now rated by 
        Moody’s, unlike 28 per cent in 2006. In total, Moody’s rated close to 
        US$12.7 billion of new corporate debt in the GCC in 2007 of a total now 
        exceeding US$14.6 billion.<br>
        <br>
        Issuance has also become more diverse, with 2006 still being dominated 
        by a small handful of large issuers. Whilst in 2006, a total of 13 
        corporates tapped into the capital markets, this number increased to 18 
        in 2007. More importantly, the market was no longer dominated by a few 
        issuers. While in 2006, three issuers alone had made up nearly 
        three-quarters of the total market, this figure dropped to 41 per cent 
        in 2007. There were also greater contributions from GCC countries 
        outside of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in particular from Saudi 
        Arabia, whose contribution rose from 7 per cent to 31 per cent in 2007. 
        This, in fact, underlines Saudi Arabia’s large potential, which Moody’s 
        expects to grow further going forward. Nevertheless, 65 per cent of 
        total issuance came from the UAE (and Dubai in particular), which 
        remained the engine in 2007.<br>
        <br>
        According to Moody’s, three key trends have fuelled issuance (and new 
        rating activity) in 2007 and are likely to support this trend going into 
        2008: <br>
        <br>
        <b>Rising financing requirements driven by large-scale infrastructure 
        investments and/or international expansion through M&amp;A</b><br>
        The vast majority of 2007 issuance was driven by substantial 
        infrastructure expansion activities, which themselves are being fuelled 
        by strong economic activity and non-oil diversification, as well as 
        widespread population growth (both organically and from expatriate 
        immigration). <br>
        <br>
        Moody’s estimates that over 50 per cent of 2007 issuance was motivated 
        by infrastructure spending in a wider sense, including tourism, 
        transport and energy-related expansion. Most of these funds are thus 
        directed at inward investments. A further 21 per cent of issuance was 
        real-estate-related, with arguably narrowly-defined boundaries between 
        real estate and infrastructure. This predominantly includes purchases of 
        land banks and funding of construction activities, and again was largely 
        directed at the respective local economies. Finally, Moody’s regards 
        around 26 per cent of issuance as related to mergers and acquisitions 
        (M&amp;A), and driven largely by Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) 
        and SABIC.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Greater awareness of corporate governance and financial transparency, 
        with ratings regarded as an important step in adopting higher disclosure 
        standards <br>
        </b>At the same time, there have been a number of companies that have 
        obtained credit ratings as part of a wider strategy to become more 
        transparent and accountable, whilst at the same time providing them with 
        a higher degree of readiness to tap the markets. Oman Power and Water 
        Procurement Company, the first ever corporate rating in the Sultanate of 
        Oman, is largely prohibited from raising long-term debt, yet it regarded 
        its rating as an important tool in promoting the country’s electricity 
        industry and regulatory framework. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Government-sponsored initiatives to create a liquid corporate bond 
        market as part of the creation of more diversified regional financial 
        centres</b><br>
        Whilst not the single driving force, government initiatives to create a 
        liquid bond market have certainly contributed positively to issuances in 
        2007. Abu Dhabi’s decision to obtain a sovereign rating and issue a 
        benchmark-sized bond – though admittedly far from requiring the funds – 
        was the single biggest event in the region in terms of supporting the 
        development of the capital markets. Although government-related issuers, 
        particularly in Dubai, have been able to test the waters, it is the 
        government itself that should be creating the yield curve around which 
        the wider market can grow. Dubai itself has been positioning its Dubai 
        International Financial Exchange (DIFX) to increasingly become the 
        regional hub for Sukuk. This position has been further enforced by the 
        Emirate’s ability to not only attract Dubai-based issuance, but also a 
        growing number of instruments from outside Dubai, notably the Sukuk 
        issued by the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority and Dar Al Arkan Real 
        Estate Company of Saudi Arabia.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2008 Outlook: considerable funding potential </b><br>
        While the GCC markets have not been directly affected by the recent 
        turmoil, given limited sub-prime exposure, growing domestic economies 
        and large liquidity from record oil and gas prices, markets have been 
        affected with spreads at the year-end on average of 40 to 80 basis 
        points wider than earlier in the year. <br>
        <br>
        In some cases, this has lead to companies reverting to cheaper bank 
        financing and deferring their capital markets activity. Indeed, Moody’s 
        estimates that up to US$10 billion worth of financing were either 
        deferred or bridged through the banking market in the last quarter due 
        to less attractive capital markets. It is therefore likely that new 
        issuance and rating activity will remain robust throughout 2008, 
        although companies may want to first establish whether conditions are 
        worsening or improving, and may ultimately have to grow accustomed to 
        more expensive financing terms. <br>
        <br>
        Given the large amount of liquidity in the local markets, but more 
        importantly the unchanged need for large-scale financing, major 
        government-related borrowers with sound credit stories are likely to 
        experience fewer problems, particularly when demonstrating flexibility 
        on tenor and currency. Global credit woes make the GCC market 
        increasingly difficult to predict. However, the fundamentals remain 
        strong and will ultimately continue to drive new issuance (and thus 
        rating) activity. The biggest single driver remains inward investment, 
        which will continue to require financing, and covers everything from 
        roads, ports, power plants, hydrocarbon assets and tourism projects. 
        Such financing demands have the potential to double issuance volumes 
        over the next couple of years, possibly already in 2008 if markets 
        settle and if both pent-up 2007 and future demand materialise. <br>
        <br>
        Moody’s also notes that there is substantial short-term bridge financing 
        in the wider market, as companies have financed acquisitions on a 
        short-term basis through the bank markets, particularly amongst the 
        large consolidators in the regional telecom sector. Some sovereign 
        wealth funds and government holding companies have been raising 
        short-term funds in preparation for acquisitions, such as the US$5 
        billion syndicated loans raised by Dubai World. Qatar alone has plans to 
        raise up to US$15 billion next year. Overall, Moody’s estimates that 
        total corporate bond issuance in planning or consideration over the 
        coming 12 months could be up to US$50 billion. <br>
        <br>
        Moody’s expects the market to continue to become more diversified, as 
        Saudi Arabia and Qatar in particular become more prominent issuers. Abu 
        Dhabi’s decision to publish its Aa2 sovereign rating and issue a bond, 
        thus creating a local benchmark, is also likely to support gradual 
        increases in activity in the UAE’s capital, with Dubai currently driving 
        issuance in the Federation. <br>
        <br>
        Moody’s also expect further activity from lower-rated entities–those 
        with no government ownership–in the Baa range over time, although we do 
        not see the emergence of a rated high-yield market as imminent. 
        Generally, the widening of the rating universe from higher to 
        lower-rated entities is a longer-term process, one necessary for a true 
        diversification of credit risk and return. In the interim, higher-rated 
        government-related infrastructure spending is likely to continue to 
        dominate ratings in the region.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Shari’ah compliance debate</b><br>
        Recently, we have seen heightened debate surrounding the true Shari’ah 
        compliance of Sukuk structures, with the Accounting and Auditing 
        Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) stating that up 
        to 85 per cent of Sukuk issued in the Gulf do not strictly comply with 
        Shari’ah law. This is due to the presence of the par value repurchase 
        undertaking, which ensures that any repayment risk remains with the 
        originator of the transaction, and not with the issuing vehicle and its 
        underlying assets. According to the AAOIFI, such a promise is in 
        violation of the concept of risk and profit sharing, which underpins the 
        principle of a Sukuk. <br>
        <br>
        Moody’s defers opinion on Shari’ah compliance with the scholars who 
        provide the Fatwa on each Sukuk. From a Moody’s credit risk perspective, 
        the par value repurchase undertaking for an ‘asset-based’ Sukuk (the 
        majority of current issuance) is a central element in order for the 
        Sukuk to be viewed as a senior unsecured instrument and thus for it to 
        obtain the same rating and have similar credit risk characteristics as 
        the transaction originator. <br>
        <br>
        Any de-linkage of the Sukuk performance from the originator, and thus 
        greater reliance on the performance of the underlying asset(s), would 
        significantly alter the rating and risk profile of the affected 
        transactions, as such the instruments would then obtain greater asset 
        risk or equity features. Ultimately, those Sukuk whose performance 
        profile is entirely dependent on assets (securitisation Sukuk) can have 
        ratings and risk profiles completely independent to those of the 
        originator. <br>
        <br>
        Moody’s recognises the importance of debate in this growing market, 
        which may result in a greater diversity of Shari’ah-compliant financial 
        instruments across a wider spectrum of fixed income and equity-related 
        products. Recent trends point towards greater standardisation of legal 
        documentation, but Moody’s will continue to review each Sukuk 
        transaction on the basis of their specific contracts and individual 
        creditworthiness, without opining on compliance with Shari’ah or any 
        other law to the extent that non-compliance does not introduce any new 
        credit risk.</font></p>

        assets and preserve the rights of the future generations,” Al Dhahrani

        <br>
        According to the Speaker of the Council of Representatives, Bahrain has 
        been a champion of free market economy and has facilitated foreign 
        investment and the establishment of international companies in a highly 
        positive fiscal environment. “It is only fair that foreign investors 
        should contribute to the expenses by paying taxes,” Al Dhahrani said. He 
        did not specify the tax rate or suggest a date for applying the new 
        regime. However, Al Dhahrani said that Bahraini and Gulf nationals 
        should be exempted from paying the taxes and that expatriates in the

        should be limited to commercial activities.<br>

        <font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
        Diplomats, expatriates and human rights activists have strongly 
        condemned a proposal to introduce two separate price scales for basic 
        commodities for Bahrainis and foreigners. The MPs agreed in January to 
        study the possibility of introducing subsidised rates exclusively for 
        local consumers. They blamed inflation for rising crime and violence. 
        The MPs also called for rice, sugar, children’s milk and cooking oil to 
        be added to the list of subsidised products. But Bahrain Human Rights 
        Society assistant general secretary Abdulla Al Deerazi said separate 
        price scales for Bahrainis and expatriates would be a violation of human 
        rights. “We don’t agree with this because it is called discrimination,” 
        he said. “Human rights are being violated when something like this is 
        even considered and where else have you heard something like this? In 
        any country, both expatriates and locals should be treated equally, at 
        least when they’re buying basic commodities”. Indian Embassy First 
        Secretary A K Bhatnagar was also not in favour of such a policy, as he 
        said, “If the prices of commodities are going to be subsidised, it must 
        be uniform for all, regardless of nationality.”<br>

        <img border="0" src="gcc12.jpg" width="175" height="114" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6">Qatar, whose economy is set to double in five years, will develop the 
        “economic diversity” necessary to move away from any future downturn in 
        oil and gas prices, the Minister of Finance Yousef Hussein Kamal said. 
        “For Qatar, the outlook is particularly bright. With the energy sector 
        still accounting for some 60 per cent of our GDP, the growth in oil 
        prices will continue to fuel our economy. At the same time, it will 
        allow us to develop the economic diversity necessary to move away from 
        any future downturn in oil and gas prices in the medium to long term,” 
        Kamal said.<br>
        <br>
        The minister said as of the fourth quarter of 2007, the Middle East 
        Economic Digest figures put the value of projects planned or underway in 
        Qatar at over US$142 billion – more than 20 per cent up on the same 
        period in 2006. With around 50 per cent of these schemes being project 
        financed (and around a further US$55 billion coming through syndications 
        and US$15 billion in bonds), Qatar has a strong incentive to build the 
        infrastructure necessary to attract and retain world-class financial 
        institutions. “This we have done at the Qatar Financial Centre, which 
        has since inception in 2005, attracted and is now regulating some 70 of 
        the world’s leading banks, insurers, investment houses and asset 
        managers,” the minister said. Qatar will further improve its regulatory 
        environment, with the integration of the QFC Regulatory Authority, the 
        Qatar Financial Markets Authority, and the regulatory functions of the 
        Qatar Central Bank into a new single regulatory authority. “With one 
        authority, we believe we will be able to achieve greater efficiency and 
        higher standards of regulation. We are calling it the Qatar Financial 
        Regulatory Authority (QFRA),” Kamal said. He also said between 2002 and 
        2006, the six member states of the GCC have earned between US$1.2 
        trillion and US$1.5 trillion in revenues that have been invested both at 
        home and overseas. <br>

        Qatar is planning a 140 km light rail system in Doha to help ease 
        traffic congestion ahead of its 2016 Olympic Games bid. Qatar, which 
        officially launched its bid to host the summer Olympics in January, is 
        expected to spend billions of dollars to revamp its transport 
        infrastructure, irrespective of whether its Olympic bid is successful or 
        not. Construction of the light rail system’s first 85 km is scheduled to 
        begin in 2009, with completion of the metro scheduled for 2015. The 
        network will link all proposed Olympic venues and villages, including 
        the New Doha International Airport, Doha Port and the hotel district.

        HSBC Holding has said Kuwaiti shares offer the best value in the GCC 
        after the Emirate’s Parliament recently eliminated a 55 per cent capital

        corporate tax rate levied on foreign companies’ profits to 15 per cent 
        from 55 per cent. Kuwait’s equity benchmark rose 25 per cent last year,

        Kuwait will experience a property boom in 2008 due to the creation of

        KUNA, citing a report by Al-Mutakhassis Real Estate. Other factors that 
        are expected to boost the real estate market are the release of land by 
        Kuwait Petroleum Company for the creation of 16,000 low cost housing

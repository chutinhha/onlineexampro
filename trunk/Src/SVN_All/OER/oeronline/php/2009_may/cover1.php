            <img border="0" src="cover15.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="379">The year 2008 was a roller coaster year for all commodities. Like 
            the prices of oil, the prices of vegetable oils also shot through 
            the roof during the first half of 2008, peaking in July just as the 
            US sub-prime effect began to extend its vice-like grip on the global 
            economy. But beginning in September 2008, the commodity prices 
            started tumbling and troughed by almost 45 per cent by December. 
            While companies slowed down in line with changing market dynamics, 
            Areej Vegetable Oils &amp; Derivatives (AVOD) moved smoothly ahead like 
            a well-oil production machine.<br>
            <br>
            “The vegetable oil market followed the petroleum oil story and other 
            commodities. Therefore the key was to manage purchasing and buyings 
            to suit the market rather than the interests of speculators. I think 
            we managed it extremely well and finished 2008 with good topline and 
            bottomline results,” says Prem Maker, Executive Director of AVOD. 
            The company’s revenues soared to RO90.68mn in 2008 as compared to 
            RO53mn showing a year-on-year growth of more than 71 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The ‘Khafeef’ storm<br>
            </b>Apart from the high commodity prices, there are many factors that 
            have contributed to the phenomenal growth of AVOD. One of the most 
            significant features was the launch of corn-oil based frying oil 
            Khafeef Oil in August 2008. At about the same time as the global 
            financial crisis began hitting companies hard, Areej Vegetable Oils 
            took the northern route by introducing its revolutionary product 
            innovation – Khafeef – the lightest frying oil in the GCC. This 
            specialised frying oil was packed in a stylised bottle, which 
            typifies the image of a woman, who is the ultimate user of the 
            product. Explains Maker: “It began with extensive consumer research 
            and evaluation of different oils in actual frying tests conducted 
            with breaded chicken fillet in research labs. Then we invested RO4mn 
            in plant and packaging machinery to deliver on the new technology 
            for this new oil. The finished product, Khafeef, packaged in a 
            beautiful PET bottle, took the market by storm.”<br>
            <br>
            <b>Market leader</b><br>
            Areej Vegetable Oils was established in 1980 with a majority 
            shareholding of the OMZEST Group. It has a modern hygienic plant 
            located at Rusayl Industrial Estate to manufacture and market top 
            quality cooking oils, ghee, margarine, specialty fats and butter 
            products.<br>
            <br>
            The company’s leading brands Minara, Sohar, Khafeef, Jabal Akhdar 
            and Muscat Margarine are trusted names in every Omani home. Areej 
            Vegetable Oils enjoys a 65 per cent market share in Oman and current 
            exports are 70 per cent of the total business. The company exports 
            to 23 countries around the world. Says Maker: “We have done better 
            than our competitors basically because we do not speculate. We 
            follow the basic economics of supply and demand and that is why when 
            the crunch period came, we were not affected seriously. We are 
            manufacturers of a product not speculators.”</font></p>

            <b>Innovation is the key<br>
            </b>Success has followed AVOD mainly through its innovative products and 
            packages which have attracted the customers. Some of the innovations 
            done by the company include the bag-in-carton cooking oil that was a 
            huge success in Oman and UAE. ‘Sohar’ was the first blended oil in 
            the GCC to suit Omani frying habits. ‘Minara’ was the first cooking 
            oil in a crystal clear bottle to make an entry in the GCC market. 
            Furthermore, Minara was the first PET bottle in the GCC with a 
            handle. Exports also got a major fillip with the manufacture and 
            sale of private label brands in PET bottles
            with handles.<br>
            <br>
            Maker attributes the success of the company basically to a market 
            hunch or in other words matching your business plans to market 
            realities. “We have controlled our cash flows and stocks and we have 
            always been realistic in our expectations, as I had said earlier. 
            Khafeef is a prime example of catering to the market realities and 
            we have achieved tremendous success with this product,” says Maker.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Cost, price effective<br>
            </b>The company continues to grow in new markets with products such as 
            ghee in tins, bag-in-box; polyjars cooking oil in tins; blended oil 
            in clear pet bottles; specialty oils and shortenings etc. 
            Multinationals like Pepsico (Snacks), Unilever and Emborg source 
            their requirements for the Gulf from Areej Vegetable Oils. <br>
            <br>
            Besides product innovations, AVOD has increased its investments in 
            modernisation of plant and upgrading of technology in order to 
            deliver cost effective products to the customers thus delivering 
            more returns to the shareholders. Riding high on its new-found 
            euphoria, Areej Vegetable Oils tasted sweet success again. <br>
            <br>
            While the world shrank into recession, the company expanded its 
            geographical reach to the non-GCC markets and made inroads into Iraq 
            in 2008 itself and increased its market share there by 35-40 per 
            cent. In Oman, AVOD has six major brands of cooking oils, two brands 
            of ghee, and two margarines.</font></p>

            “In 2008, the company saw its turnover increasing by 28 per cent in 
            comparison to 2007 and strong and significant order intake. In fact, 
            the order intake will take us through 2009,” says Peter Hall, CEO of 
            the company. <br>
            <b> <br>
            Healthy order book </b> <br>
            In the oil, gas and petrochemicals sector, the company was awarded 
            at the beginning of 2008, an EPC contract from Petroleum Development 
            Oman (PDO) for their Full Field Water Injection project at Nimr. 
            AHEC is on schedule for the project which is approaching 50 per cent 
            completion and it has successfully completed one year without a 
            ‘Lost Time Injury Incident.’ For Korean company, GS Engineering, 
            AHEC is in the closing stages of completing two major civil, 
            mechanical and pipework contracts, one on the Sohar Aromatics plant 
            and the second at Salalah Methanol plant.<br>
            <br>
            In the early part of the year, AHEC secured a multi-million dollar 
            contract for the Burhan West and Harmal Pipeline project from the 
            government gas department. The project which will be managed by PDO, 
            further strengthens AHEC’s reputation as one of the few contractors 
            in Oman having capabilities to handle exotic materials such as 
            duplex stainless steel (DSS). As far as the power sector is 
            concerned, AHEC has an extraordinary record in the field, having 
            installed approximately 40 per cent of the generating capacity of 
            Oman. AHEC is currently in the closing stages of completing what 
            will be the largest power plant in Oman. Working with the French 
            manufacturer Alstom, the 1,000 MW gas turbine combined cycle power 
            plant for Sohar Aluminium will be fully commissioned in the coming 
            months. During 2008, AHEC completed work on the installation of the 
            largest power plants on the PDO system at Mukhaizna (250 MW) &amp; Qarn 
            Alam (125 MW). In addition, AHEC is currently executing the job of 
            once-through heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) contract for Gulf 
            Steam Generators – a subsidiary of NeM Netherlands and a leader in 
            the field of steam generation. Another project involving steam 
            generating equipment is the cogeneration plant being executed for 
            Hirbodan-HICO at ORPC in Mina Al Fahal, which includes two heat 
            recovery steam generators and one auxilliary boiler.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tapping the regional market<br>
            </b>In 2009, AHEC made its entry into the regional market, securing an 
            order from Siemens to undertake civil works associated with a new 
            Dubai Electricity and Water Authority’s substation in Dubai. In the 
            water sector, AHEC secured the civil work contract from Korean 
            company Hyundai Rotem for the Seeb Wastewater treatment plant which 
            will be completed for Haya Water over the next two years. AHEC has 
            implemented several initiatives in the areas of communications, IT, 
            quality, procurement, human resources and corporate social 
            responsibility in 2008. “The company went in for a major revamp of 
            its website keeping in mind its global audience of potential 
            partners, job seekers, customers, journalists and investors. Google 
            analytics reports have shown a 150 per cent increase in the number 
            of unique website visitors,” says Hall.<br>
            <br>
            AHEC is also undertaking other systemic improvements. It has 
            expanded the existing Oracle based ERP to include areas and 
            departments that have hitherto not been covered. It has seen 
            significant savings in the areas where this system is currently 
            operational. In order to further streamline its procurement 
            function, AHEC moved part of its procurement processes online via 
            ‘Tejari Transact’, a Business-to-Business (B2B) electronic 
            marketplace. <br>
            <br>
            Omanisation has always been a strategic priority for AHEC. 
            Continuing the drive of inducting quality Omani manpower, qualified 
            engineers were recruited in different disciplines of the business. 
            AHEC’s key corporate social responsibility initiatives in 2008 
            include sponsoring International Conference on Harnessing Technology 
            and BG Energy Challenge.</font></p>

            </b>From a small construction office in 1982, to the first contracting 
            company listed on Muscat Securities Market in 1998, AHEC has come a 
            long way in being recognised as a major EPC (engineering, 
            procurement and construction) company in Oman. Execution experience 
            of around 100 contracts for some of the leading companies in Oman in 
            oil, gas, petrochemicals, power, water and wastewater sectors and 
            its credentials as a member of the Al Hassan Group are amongst the 
            reasons for AHEC being considered the preferred partner for 
            nation-building projects.<br>
            <br>
            The cornerstones for AHEC’s continuous success in project execution 
            are its excellent capabilities in resource management and 
            mobilisation, HSE, quality, procurement, fabrication and 
            engineering. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) is a top priority 
            for AHEC. The company’s HSE standards are legendary for which it has 
            won numerous awards from customers, industry associations and 
            international EPC contractors. During 2008, AHEC has set new 
            benchmarks in HSE. The company has driven 12.8 million kms and have 
            worked 13.4 million man-hours for all projects without any Loss Time 
            Injury (LTI). AHEC’s Quality Management System has been accredited 
            with ISO 9000 since 1996. It is currently ISO 9001:2000 certified. 
            The company has executed many projects as joint ventures (JVs) with 
            international EPC contractors like SNC Lavalin, Stone-Webster and 
            BHEL.<br>
            <br>
            The company has its own full fledged fabrication facility at Muscat 
            which allows it to pre-fabricate a number of items in a controlled 
            environment, thereby, saving time and cost. The company continues to 
            build upon its already enviable reputation in the construction and 
            EPC industry by being able to utilise skilled and experienced design 
            and engineering people.</font></p>

            <b>‘Maintaining a heritage calls for concerted effort’ – Adil Ghouse, 
            CEO, Consumer Products Group, Khimji Ramdas</b><br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover12.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="275" height="271">There are several fundamental elements that make for a successful 
            company,” says Adil Ghouse, CEO, Consumer Products Group, Khimji 
            Ramdas (KR). Managing ones finances is the first pre-requisite of 
            any successful company. Financial discipline is important, as 
            successful businesses are based on profits. <br>
            <br>
            Sustainability of a business is another key factor – this may 
            require changing products or variants to suit the changing dynamics 
            of the market and customer tastes. Says Ghouse, “You cannot deal 
            with new issues in old ways in a competitive environment.” KR, a 
            company that dates back to 1830 is itself a living testament of 
            adapting to change. For instance, the group has in the last few 
            years repositioned Khimji Mart (K-Marts) as a neighbourhood store, 
            to differentiate it from the large format stores. The other part of 
            the strategy has been to focus on towns outside the Capital area, 
            like Bahla, Sur, Nizwa etc. In the last six years the number of 
            K-Marts have gone up from four to 16. The quality of service and 
            product profile of these stores have made them destination markets 
            in most of these smaller towns. To cite another example, over the 
            last five years, KR has gone from distributing 500 stock keeping 
            units (SKUs) from P&amp;G to 1500 SKUs. This has necessitated a change 
            in the process systems followed by the company. “There are several 
            elements involved in managing the supply chain like the accuracy of 
            forecasting, technology, collecting and analysing the data and 
            communication channels with the principals,” says Ghouse.<br>
            <br>
            <b>People make the difference<br>
            <img border="0" src="cover11.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="222" height="127"></b>The importance of people can hardly be overstated, as it is their 
            efforts and passion that are the bedrock of any institution. 
            Instilling the right values and guiding them is a pre requisite for 
            going from good to great. KR follows a stringent selection process 
            to ensure that it is recruiting the right talent. Recruits are then 
            put through an induction programme at the Khimji Training Institute, 
            which is followed by an on-the job training. The company also 
            carries out regular ‘People Development Programmes.’ Apart from 
            skill sets, these programmes are geared to instil the KR values of 
            Trust, Care and Commitment amongst its people. “One of the elements 
            of having a 138 year old heritage is that our stakeholders have a 
            lot of faith in the KR name, this puts on us the responsibility of 
            ensuring that this heritage is not compromised at any given point,” 
            avers Ghouse.</font></p>

            downturn as we can deliver on these same set of values to the 
            customers,” says Richard P Russell, MD &amp; CEO, Blue City Company 1, 
            which oversees the Phase I of Al Madina A’Zarqa. “When the going 
            gets tough, customer focus is important because this is where our 
            core business is as we are a real estate company,” adds Russell. 
            Different companies adopt different strategies in a downturn. There 
            are many companies, which rise fast, and then they ‘unexpand’ 
            rapidly. Blue City is in a better position because it has been going 
            through a steady expansion and on the other side, the company has 
            been filling its organisational chart with professionals.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Focus on priorities</b><br>
            Thus, as a first step in a downturn, you start focusing on your 
            priorities and look at the value added propositions that you can 
            make for your customer. Then you need to cut out all the unnecessary 
            action and it may vary from company to company. The most important 
            is the efficient use of your manpower. Sometimes it is cost 
            effective to outsource your jobs while at other times, the proper 
            utilisation of manpower and talent is extremely important.<br>
            <br>
            <b>
            <img border="0" src="cover10.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="194" height="207">The Omani example<br>
            </b>Russell points out that we don’t need to go far to look for examples 
            as Oman itself is a perfect analogy on how to beat the downturn. 
            Oman, under the wise leadership of His Majesty The Sultan, is like a 
            large well-managed company. While many other neighbouring countries 
            are reeling under the impact of the financial slowdown, Oman is well 
            positioned to weather the economic storm as its policies of prudent 
            spending, conservative outlook and sound financial regulations have 
            stood the country in good stead. If you add up the short term 
            five-year policies and the long term ‘Vision 2020 development 
            policy’ crafted by the government, lo and behold, you have the 
            perfect ingredients to last any kind of financial crisis, Russell 
            opines.<br>
            <br>
            A company also has to make sure that its foundations are right 
            because form follows function and not the other way round. Again 
            this is going back to the basics. A downturn is actually a catalyst 
            for expansion into new horizons and brings out new ideas and 
            innovations.</font></p>

            companies,” says P Chandrasekhr, group general manager, Jawad Sultan 
            Group of Companies (JSG), he adds, “CEO’s need to stay focussed on 
            their strategy whether it is a period of buoyancy or crisis, one 
            should not let emotions run riot.” A stable senior management team 
            helps in building an enduring company, by providing leadership, 
            vision and keeping in view shareholder objectives. <br>
            <br>
            <b>The purse strings <br>
            </b>Managing finances and maintaining cash flow is important for any 
            company. “One of the fundamental philosophies of our group is to be 
            conservative. We do not want to diversify into unrelated areas by 
            leveraging. Mostly, we try to use our profits to expand the 
            business.” The group is thus less dependent on external funding. A 
            look at JSG’s core businesses underscores the point. Capital Store, 
            their flagship retail brand has been around for 30 years. Counting 
            shop-in-shops there are ten Capital Store outlets in Oman. Its 
            telecom business (Jawad Sultan Technologies) has migrated from 
            selling products to providing technology solutions. In the 
            entertainment business, the company owns a number of large screen 
            cinema halls under the City Cinema brand name. The group recently 
            forayed into Sohar opening an entertainment complex. Plans are afoot 
            to expand the 
            <img border="0" src="cover8.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="196" height="114">business to Salalah and Buraimi. As a policy the group 
            has focussed on businesses that generate a daily cash flow. <br>
            <br>
            Being in the same business for years gives a manager domain 
            knowledge. This comes in handy while taking a decision. Says 
            Chandrasekhr, “After a point all decisions are taken on gut feel or 
            by the rule of thumb and detailing and factual
            information can take you only so far.”<br>
            <br>
            <b>Devil in the details </b> <br>
            Compensations should be steady and evenly distributed, so that 
            salary structures are seen as being fair. Attention to detail is 
            important as it sends a signal that the CEO has his hands ‘on the 
            pulse’ of the company. The unique feature of businesses in the Gulf 
            is that even in listed companies, the family culture is dominant. So 
            though, there are professionals, the patriarch runs the show in most 
            cases. “Decisions are taken by consensus between family members with 
            the advice of professional mangers. It is a good business model 
            because it has endured over time,” says Chandrasekhr.

            follows its motto of being ‘pleasingly different’ whether it is a 
            downturn or not, says Cormack. An important thing is the quality of 
            service that we provide which is again determined by the quality of 
            people that we employ as our staff. Therefore Nawras is all about 
            people. Therefore the selection of people is very important because

            style of working, points out Cormack. “We have an open and inclusive 
            style of working and this helps in making decisions quicker. You can 
            share information as and when you require it. A working environment 
            should have the element of fun and managers should not spend their 
            time minding their subordinates but they should manage the people in 
            such a way as to create motivation. This is one of the key elements 
            of our success,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            Nawras also encourages team-work vigorously and people are asked to 
            form virtual teams to help them solve the customer’s problems. The 
            fourth but not the least component of the success of Cormack’s 
            company is that it is a people based company and as such those who 
            commit mistakes are not discouraged but on the contrary they are 
            motivated to do better. They are encouraged to quickly fix their 
            mistakes and learn as a company. By doing this, they create a 
            climate of erasing the guilt and build an ever greater quality of 
            service.

            ‘A CEO has to be futuristic in his outlook and should not ignore

            <img border="0" src="cover3.jpg" align="left" width="275" height="229" hspace="8" vspace="6">Metal Box India, was the market leader of tin packaging in India 
            around 50 years ago. But the company never thought that it would 
            fold up and eventually vanish from the market. In the face of stiff 
            competition from modern packaging methods and alternative packing 
            materials like plastic, Modern Box India lost out and today it’s no 
            longer remembered.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Outdated thinking</b><br>
            “The problem with companies like Modern Box India is that they don’t 
            see the writing on the wall. Similar is the case with General Motors 
            of the US, which was thought of to be ‘the company’ that could 
            outlast any situation. GM went on building bigger cars when the 
            price of gasoline was shooting up. Then what happened?,” asks 
            Krishna Kumar Gupta, CEO of Al Anwar Holdings. Gupta cites these 
            examples to highlight the importance of modernisation and innovation 
            in order to build an enduring company during a downturn like the 
            present global financial crisis. Although no one can predict the 
            future, it is important to look at the future and make the necessary 
            adjustments now. The Abu Dhabi government, for example, has abundant 
            reserves of oil but they are still investing heavily in renewable 
            sources of energy although it is not a preferred source of energy at 
            the moment, points out Gupta.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Evolve yourself</b><br>
            <img border="0" src="cover4.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="197" height="181">“A CEO of an efficient operation has to be futuristic all the time 
            even though his business is doing well because you never know what 
            the next decade holds for you. Never ignore innovation, new 
            techniques, new alternatives to keep up the development process 
            going on. Be a leader in all the departments mentioned above,” 
            advises Gupta.<br>
            <br>
            Situations like the present global downturn, segregates the men from 
            the boys because those who can do successful risk mitigation in the 
            present circumstances are those who will emerge the strongest. Risk 
            management is important because there is always risk in every aspect 
            of life, whether it is financial, political, for a country or an 
            individual. Therefore, identifying the risks and knowing how to 
            mitigate it is very essential and if you do it carefully, you cannot 
            fail, Gupta says.<br>
            Actually, any problem also presents an opportunity and the challenge 
            for CEOs is to convince the board of directors that ‘here is the 
            problem and here is the opportunity’. If any manager can achieve 
            that it opens the door to build an enduring company come what may.</font></p>

            Corporation</b><br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="275" height="298">How to build enduring companies? If we had certain answers to the 
            question we would be wanted by every company in the world,” says 
            Giles Cunningham, CEO, The Zubair Corporation. On a more serious 
            note he thinks it is about espousing certain values – the paramount 
            amongst these being customer centricity – which is an ability to 
            understand the changing needs of customers overtime. There are 
            numerous instances of how successful companies went down only 
            because they were not able to keep up with the times. <br>
            <br>
            <b>A new sensibility</b><br>
            Keeping up with the times requires an entrepreneurial streak of 
            being open to change. “Some of the most successful companies have 
            had to let go of what made them successful and change, this requires 
            a lot of courage. Companies need to look forward rather than looking 
            back,” says Cunningham. <br>
            <br>
            The four decade old, Zubair group is preparing itself for the future 
            as exemplified by its advertising tagline – ‘Future Ready.’ The 
            operational functioning of the company has been handed over to 
            professionals. Says Cunningham, “We are investing in our key markets 
            but we recognise the fact that we need to create an investment 
            mindset. Traditionally we have tended to grow our business over the 
            long term, but now we are being pro active about return on 
            investments.”<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="196" height="114">The company is also working on getting a better understanding of the 
            market. This is being done by stepping up its research efforts. The 
            exercise is expected to give the management a better understanding 
            of how to position the company. A chief strategy officer has been 
            appointed to oversee this exercise. “Our 40-year old legacy inspires 
            us but does not weigh us down,” says Cunningham. <br>
            <br>
            <b>HR focus </b> <br>
            Developing people capabilities is the other important ingredient of 
            building a robust institution. The Zubair group has rolled out the, 
            ‘Gold Programme for Graduates’ to train Omanis. Managing both for 
            the long term and short term is one of the biggest challenge faced 
            by CEOs. Cunningham avers, “Developing a long term strategy, but 
            delivering profits in the short term is a dilemma.” Luckily, the 
            tyranny of quarterly numbers is not as intense in Oman. Apart from 
            financial parameters, the group measures success on three other 
            parameters – the satisfaction of customers and employees and return 
            to shareholders.<br>

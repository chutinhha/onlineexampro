            <img border="0" src="cover88.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="220" height="278">For the sixth consecutive year, 2008 has been fairly positive for 
            Oman’s economy in general due to the growth in the first half of 
            2008. The price of oil continued to increase during the earlier part 
            of the year 2008. Oman crude realised an average price of $101.06 
            per barrel in 2008 compared with an average price of $65.15 for 2007 
            and the budgeted price of $40 per barrel for 2008. The original 
            total appropriations for the year 2008 of RO5,800mn were 
            substantially increased by a further RO603mn to implement a number 
            of development and basic infrastructure projects. Due to the higher 
            oil prices the actual budget was projected to close with a budgetary 
            surplus of RO1,581mn as against a projected deficit of RO400mn.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Market meltdown<br>
            </b>However, due to the global financial meltdown, 2008 has been quite 
            challenging for the Muscat Securities Market (MSM). You may recall 
            from our statement last year that due to the bursting of the ‘Credit 
            Bubble’ in a year that was full of bad news for developed markets, 
            emerging markets spent 2007 on another planet, with returns of 35 
            per cent to 40 per cent. This phenomenon continued till the middle 
            of 2008 but hit home with a vengeance in the second half of 2008. 
            The MSM ended the year as the fourth best performing stock market in 
            the GCC with an overall decline of 40 per cent. Two successful IPOs 
            were launched during the first half of the year with unprecedented 
            oversubscription of more than 25 times. Trading volumes amounted to 
            RO3,710mn in 2008 compared to RO2,321mn in 2007, an increase of 59.8 
            per cent. The benchmark MSM 30 index ended the year at 5,441 points, 
            a loss of 39.78 per cent for the year. The top performer was the 
            services and insurance sector which was down 28 per cent followed by 
            the industry sector which lost 45 per cent and the banking and 
            investment sector was the worst hit ending with a decrease of 46 per 
            cent. Foreign participation in the capital of the listed joint stock 
            companies also reduced during the year to 23.84 per cent compared to 
            27.55 per cent last year, a decrease of about 13 per cent.</font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to higher oil prices in the first half of the year, increased 
            non-oil exports and strong demand, the GDP growth rate for 2008 is 
            estimated at 10 per cent. Oil production increased in 2008 by about 
            seven per cent. The government’s continued emphasis on diversifying 
            the economy away from dependence on oil gained further momentum 
            during 2008. Non oil exports grew by 27 per cent. Most of the real 
            estate development projects started in 2007 continued and the
            tourism sector grew by 22 per cent.<br>

            <img border="0" src="cover90.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="279" height="310">Performance of western world financial markets continued to be 
            greatly affected due to the worldwide recession. MSCI AC World index 
            was down 43.5 per cent in 2008 as global equity markets finished 
            2008 down 43.5 per cent. Japan (-30.5 per cent) was the best 
            performing region followed by the USA (-38.5 per cent) and Europe 
            (-48.2 per cent). The worst performing regions were Global Emerging 
            Markets (-54.5 per cent) and Asia Pac ex-Japan (-53.3 per cent).<br>
            <br>
            Recessions are historically times when companies make the biggest 
            competitive strides or fall behind. A 2002 survey by McKinsey of the 
            performance of 1000 companies during an 18 year period found that 
            those that made the biggest leaps in profitability were often the 
            ones that increased their spending on acquisitions and innovation 
            the most amid recessions.<br>
            <br>
            During the year 2008, the revenues of Oman’s 20 largest companies 
            showed a handsome growth. Total revenues for the OER Top 20 went up 
            by 25 per cent to RO3,220mn. Corporate performance of the year 2008, 
            overall, was also slightly positive in spite of the global 
            recession. The profits for the year 2008 increased by four per cent 
            to RO480mn from the figure of RO462mn last year. The total market 
            cap of the OER Top 20 on December 31, 2008 was RO3,975mn, which was 
            down by 44 per cent compared to 2007. On April 2, 2009, the market 
            cap of the top twenty has once again gone down to RO3,281mn. The OER 
            Top 20 companies represent 68 per cent to the total market cap of 
            the MSM of RO5,829mn at the end of 2008. The average P/E ratio of 
            the OER Top 20 based on the profits of the year 2008 and the share 
            price on April 2, 2009 is 6.84 times earnings.</font></p>

            <b>Who is out and who is in</b><br>
            We have two new comers on the list this year. Oman Flour Mills comes 
            into the number 18 spot and Al Hassan Engineering is back in the 
            number 20 slot after missing out last year. These companies have 
            made it to the OER Top 20 this year at the expense of AES Barka and 
            Oman Refreshment.<br>
            <br>
            The ranking of Oman’s 20 largest companies in order of revenue 
            produces a list, which includes the seven companies from the banking 
            and investment sector, six from the services sector and seven from 
            the industrial sector.<br>
            <br>
            There has been no change in the top ten companies in Oman by 
            revenues. Omantel continues to be the largest public company in Oman 
            with a growth in revenue of 12.74 per cent compared to last year.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover92.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="220" height="299">The Chairman of Omantel Eng. Sultan Bin Hamdoon Al Harthy in his 
            report to the shareholders explains that the main reason for good 
            growth in net profit is the continuous double digit revenue growth. 
            Al Harthy states that the total group revenue rose by 12.6 per cent. 
            Al Harthy outlines that the total group net profit after tax rose by 
            5.9 per cent to RO118.6mn. Al Harthy adds that the total subscriber 
            base has recorded a growth of 13.4 per cent. The total number of 
            subscribers has increased to 2.119mn compared to 1.869mn last year. 
            Al Harthy goes on to state that due to the global financial crisis 
            and the deteriorating market conditions in Pakistan, the value of 
            their strategic investment in Worldcall Telecom has been affected 
            and the group has recognised an impairment loss of RO18.88mn. 
            Without this impairment the net profit would have been RO137.5mn, a 
            growth
            of 22.8 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            Al Harthy cautions that during the year 2009 the sector 
            liberalisation is likely to intensify with the TRA announcement of 
            awarding Oman’s second fixed line network and possible award of more 
            Internet service providers in 2009. He adds that the government plan 
            to sell 25 per cent of its stake in Omantel to a strategic investor 
            has been called off because of the current conditions in the global 
            capital markets. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Profit index</b><br>
            Similar to last year, three of the top five most profitable 
            companies in Oman are banks. As expected in the current economic 
            climate four of the five companies are showing a small growth in 
            profits for the year whereas one is showing a decline. There is one 
            change in the top five companies by profit. Raysut Cement, which was 
            in the fourth place last year, has moved down to the number five 
            position and OIB is up from five to four. Omantel continues to 
            remain at the number one spot, Bank Muscat at the number two spot 
            and NBO at number three.<br>
            <br>
            Bank Muscat is the second most profitable company in Oman as well as 
            the third largest company in Oman based on turnover for the year 
            2008. Bank Muscat has achieved this position by recording growth in 
            profit for the year of about 11.24 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            The Chairman Abdul Malik bin Abdullah al Khalili states in his 
            yearend report to the shareholders that despite the global financial 
            crisis the key business lines of the bank continued to turn in an 
            impressive performance in 2008. Khalili adds that during 2008, the 
            return on average assets was at 1.8 per cent compared to 2.3 per 
            cent in 2007. The return on average equity was 14.8 per cent in 2008 
            compared to 25.8 per cent in 2007 and the basic earnings per share 
            was RO0.087 as against RO0.090 in 2007.<br>
            <br>
            Khalili explains that their strategic shareholding in Saudi Pak 
            Commercial Bank was impaired due to the deteriorating economic 
            situation in Pakistan and even though this investment is strategic 
            in nature as a measure of prudence the bank has provided for an 
            impairment loss of RO17mn for this investment.</font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Khalili goes on to say that the Board has proposed a dividend of 50 
            per cent, 20 per cent in the form of cash and 30 per cent in the 
            form of mandatory-convertible bonds. He advises that the 2009 
            financial market environment appears to be challenging for business 
            with tight liquidity conditions, weak equity market and tightened 
            lending norms by banks. Khalili is confident that the bank
            will sail through these turbulent times.<br>

            Al Anwar Holdings has shown the highest growth in profits by an 
            enormous 99.86 per cent and has remained in the number one spot for 
            the second year running. Three of the top five companies showing 
            highest growth of profit from last year being Oman Flour Mills, 
            Renaissance and Areej Vegetable Oil are new on the list. Al Jazeera

            the shareholders for the year ended March 31, 2008 has stated that 
            new business strategies; investment policies and procedures; and 
            risk management tools introduced by the management in the second 
            half of the year has contributed in the continued sustainable growth 
            of the company. The group has recorded 100 per cent growth in 
            profits over last year achieving its highest ever net profit of 
            RO4.33mn for the year ended March 31, 2008. He points out that out 
            of this profit RO1.13mn is generated from disposal of 31 per cent 
            shareholding in NAPCO. The board has recommended a cash dividend of 
            eight per cent and a stock dividend of 12.93 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            Al Harthy adds that the group’s subsidiaries Voltamp Manufacturing

            NAPCO, Al Anwar Blank, Falcon Insurance, Al Maha Ceramics and Addax

            Four of the top five companies that have the highest amount of 
            equity employed are banks. Four of the companies in this category 
            remain the same as last year. BankMuscat continues to remain number 
            one in this category. Omantel and NBO continue to remain in the same

            fourth quarter and after impairment charge of RO3.7mn on 
            investments. Bahwan adds that the profit from operations grew by 49 
            per cent from RO36mn to RO54mn reflecting the bank’s clear emphasis 
            on sustainable growth. He explains that the bank has diversified its 
            income as reflected in ratio of other operating income to total 
            income which increased from 37 per cent in 2007 to 46 per cent in 
            2008. Business efficiency remained an important focus and the 
            improvement in cost to income ratio continues to improve. The 
            recoveries and releases against the provisions for 2008 were at 
            RO16.6mn. Total assets ended the year at RO1.9bn. This growth was 
            linked to the growth in deposits by RO406mn (43 per cent) and growth 
            in net advances by RO494mn (54 per cent).<br>
            <br>
            Bahwan goes on to say that 2009 will pose significant challenges in 
            the international debt and capital markets. The global economy is 
            expected to continue to suffer under the impact of a prolonged 
            recession. In the GCC region, lower oil prices are expected to slow 
            the growth in the region. Bahwan states that the bank will continue

            consistent returns to the shareholders backed by a determination to 
            pursue growth with prudent risk management.<br>
            <br>
            Zawawi explains that the bank achieved a net profit of RO29.47mn for 
            the year 2008 compared to RO28.07 for 2007, an increase of 4.97 per 
            cent. The bank commands a market share of 8.23 per cent for deposits 
            and 7.4 per cent for loans and 7.77 per cent for total assets as at 
            December 31, 2008 as per the consolidated statistics from the 
            Central Bank of Oman. In the light of these results the board of 
            directors has proposed a cash dividend of 27 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            Zawawi states that the bank looks to the future with conservatism, 
            confidence and optimism. The government policies continue to focus 
            on strong economic growth with expenditure up 11 per cent and 
            revenue by four per cent. In the future the bank will increase its 
            delivery channels in terms of new state of the art branches, ATMs, 
            PoS (point of sales) and customer friendly mobile banking services. 
            She adds that the bank will make optimum use of these channels to 
            redefine customer convenience and thereby acheive continous 
            sustainable growth.</font></p>

            return on equity employed comes from the banking sector. Four of the 
            companies in the top five are newcomers to the list. Shell steps up 
            to the number one spot from being No.2 last year; Omantel, Oman Oil, 
            Al Anwar and OMINVEST take the two to five positions knocking out 
            Oman Cables, AES Barka, OHI and Raysut Cement who appeared in this 
            table last year.<br>
            <br>
            Andrew Wood, Chairman of Shell Oman Marketing, in his report to the 
            shareholders states that overall the company remained the market 
            leader amongst oil marketing companies operating in Oman. Wood adds 
            that the company achieved unprecedented financial results recording 
            a historically highest ever net profit of RO12.5mn compared to 
            previous year’s net profit of RO11.06mn. Despite the uncertainty 
            surrounding the major economies and Oman’s economy, proactive 
            management as well as sound operational performance were the 
            principal drivers of the commendable financial performance in 2008. 
            Wood explains that the retail business remains the most important 
            segment for the company. Total retail volumes sold was in excess of 
            1.3bn litres. The aviation business saw over 50 per cent increase in 
            volumes in 2008. The market penetration in the lubricants market 
            also registered record level of sales volume.<br>

            <img border="0" src="cover98.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="280" height="312">The board has recommended a final dividend of 115 per cent for the 
            year continuing the recent trend of year on year dividend growth. 
            Wood adds that the fuels market normally follows the economic trend 
            of the country and is thus expected to see some uncertainty due to 
            the volatility of the global oil prices. The Sultanate will not be 
            entirely immune from the current global recession and demand, 
            especially in the commercial and aviation sectors which, may be 
            affected as tourism and development projects slow down. The retail 
            segment on the other hand is not expected to be affected.<br>
            <br>
            Three of the top five earnings per share growth companies are 
            newcomers on this list. Oman Flour Mills jumps straight into number 
            one spot pushing Al Anwar down to the second position. Renaissance 
            comes in at the number three position, OHI continues to remain in 
            the number four position and Shell comes into the number five spot. 
            Al Jazeera Steel, OMINVEST and Al Maha Petroleum are all out.<br>
            <br>
            Samir Fancy, Chairman of Renaissance, in his report to the 
            shareholders states that Renaissance has achieved record results for 
            the seventh consecutive year. The consequence of continued focus on 
            values-driven operating model is, yet another year of growth and 
            record financial performance. Revenues of RO234mn are up from 
            RO199mn in 2007. Revenue increased by 17.6 per cent, operating 
            profit has increased by 35.8 per cent and operating margins improved 
            from 13.8 per cent in 2007 to 16 per cent in 2008. The net profit of 
            2008 includes a capital gain of RO4.8mn from the divestment of the 
            group’s former technology business.<br>
            <br>
            For the current fiscal year the board has recommended a cash 
            dividend of 10 per cent and a stock dividend of 15 per cent. Looking 
            ahead, Fancy states that it is clear that the prognosis for 
            Renaissance is good for continued growth in 2009, in spite of the 
            recession. As usual, performance will not be even across each 
            quarter. The first quarter of the year we have usual seasonal effect 
            of winter downtime in the northern Caspian and in Q1 and Q2, 2009 we 
            have a major programme of dry-docking that will ensure Q3 and Q4 
            will likely record the best financial performances of the year 
            ahead. Going into 2009, Fancy states that the company does not 
            underestimate the challenges of the recession but is taking all 
            prudent measures necessary to avert its dangers. He further states 
            that they have the right businesses, with the right customers, in 
            the right markets and have the right assets and above all the right 
            people.<br>

            <b>Role reversal<br>
            <img border="0" src="cover99.jpg" align="right" hspace="9" vspace="6" width="281" height="349"></b>All of the five companies on the shareprice growth list are 
            newcomers with Oman Oil taking the top position. Shell Marketing 
            comes in second followed by Al Hassan Engineering, Omantel and Al 
            Maha Petroleum. Al Anwar Holdings, Renaissance Services, Oman 
            Cables, Bank Dhofar and Raysut Cement from last year have all been 
            knocked out.<br>
            <br>
            Salim Abdullah Al Rawas, Chairman of Oman Oil Marketing in his 
            report to the shareholders states that 2008 was another successful 
            year for the company. The total revenue increased by 11 per cent to 
            RO170mn from the previous year’s 152.7mn. The revenue growth was due 
            to improved sales recorded for most products as well as higher 
            product prices in line with the international prices. As a result 
            the company’s pre-tax profit rose by 12 per cent to RO7.2mn.<br>
            <br>
            The board of directors recommended a final dividend of 35 per cent 
            for the financial year 31 December 2008. Al Rawas states that the 
            outlook for the coming year appears to be positive with the demand 
            for petroleum products expected to grow in line with Oman’s 
            projected economic growth. He adds that the company has placed 
            itself in a strong position for the future. Nonetheless competition 
            in all business sectors particularly in the retail business will 
            continue to persist. With ever increasing competition in the market 
            and aggressive efforts by the competitors, the company will remain 
            focused on expanding its network of facilities, improving quality of 
            its products and services, optimising costs and developing its human 
            capital even further.<br>
            <br>
            Three new companies have entered the ranking of the best five 
            dividend yield companies. Oman Flour Mills, Al Hassan and Raysut 
            Cement are newcomers in number one, four and five slots. OHI jumps 
            up to number two from number five last year and OIB retains the 
            third position.<br>
            <br>
            Manal Mohammad Al Abdawani, Chairperson of Oman Flour Mills in her 
            report to the shareholders for the year ended June 30, 2008 states 
            that while there has been remarkable improvement in the demand for 
            their flour products, which increased by six per cent in the local 
            market compared to last year, the company’s fodder sales fell by 
            eight per cent compared to previous year because of the shortage of 
            fodder raw material. The total sales amounted to 324,000 metric tons 
            which covers 65 per cent of the flour market in the Sultanate.<br>
            <br>
            Al Abdawani adds that the company exerted relentless efforts to 
            improve its operating performance. The company achieved impressive 
            results for the year ended June 30, 2008. The net profit for the 
            year was RO7.5mn compared to RO4mn for the previous year an increase 
            of 87 per cent. The company along with its subsidiaries made a net 
            profit of RO8.1mn compared to RO4.2mn in the previous year.<br>
            <br>
            Based on the good results achieved, the board has recommended a 
            dividend of 25 per cent for the year. Al Abdawani explains that the 
            company is continuing to improve operating efficiency through 
            diversifying its investments in equipment like the ship un-loader 
            that increases the discharge capacity thereby reducing cost. The 
            company is also working to add other equipment in order to improve 
            overall production efficiency. The company has also established a 
            subsidiary ‘Bread House’ to market frozen bakery products and will 
            establish an industrial bakery, the commercial production of which 
            is expected to commence in 2009.</font></p>

            </b>All companies on the list are derived from the published accounts 
            submitted to the Muscat Securities Market (MSM). Therefore, closed 
            Joint Stock Companies and private companies and establishments are 
            excluded from this list. These companies are, in the first instance, 
            ranked by Revenues. All the other rankings shown on the table do not 
            consider any other companies that do not make the list on the basis 
            of Revenue. In the case of banks the gross interest income as well 
            as other operating income together is considered as their revenue 
            for this purpose. In the case of insurance companies, the gross 
            premium written as well as investment income together is considered 
            as their revenue for this purpose. All figures are for the year 
            ended 31 December 2008, unless otherwise stated. <br>

                become an annual event for both golfers and non golfers of Oman. 
                Every year its getting’ bigger and better. Its one of the most 
                prestigious competitions of Oman. This event provides an 
                excellent opportunity to network with senior executives in a 
                very informal manner. Also winning this tournament was a great 
                feeling for me and I now look forward to participate in this 
                prestigious event next year. I wish the tournament great success 
                in the years to come.<br>

                </b>I didn’t play due to another engagement but did attend the 
                evening event. The setting for OER CEO Golf 2009 was great and 
                the event was well organised. The compere for the evening was 
                entertaining and kept the tempo going throughout what was a long 
                programme. I have played regularly in the UK and Europe, until 
                recently when I was presented with two daughters who have 
                insisted that I dedicate every waking hour to them – naturally 
                of course. So I intend to take the sport up once I get my clubs 
                out here. am sure that the event lifted spirits – people 
                certainly seemed to enjoy it and it demonstrates that people 
                have the will and spirit to go forward with positivity albeit 
                the global financial crisis.<br>

                </b>OER CEO Golf 2009 has become one of the important annual 
                rituals for the corporate world in Oman. One always looks 
                forward to be part of this event to come on common platform, to 
                be with the peer group, customers, clients, competitors and 
                friends. Meeting in such a forum gives an opportunity not only 
                to discuss business, but beyond it. OER CEO Golf is certainly a 
                good networking event. The whole day event, with full of fun 
                agenda, gives ample opportunity in a very conducive atmosphere, 
                to interact with one and all.<br>

                </b>OER CEO Golf 2009 provided an excellent opportunity to meet 
                other business professionals in a relaxed environment and also 
                to enjoy playing some golf. The event ticked all the right boxes 
                in terms of organisation, entertainment, hospitality and 
                networking. Oman Economic Review as a brand OER offers great 
                brand visibility and awareness. It was a well organised day out 
                from breakfast right through to dinner. Nawras Business 
                Solutions was proud to be the presenter and to contribute to 
                such a successful event! I must say how much I admire what the 
                irrepressible Sandeep Sehgal has built up with this superb 
                competition and I applaud the inspiring leadership Brandon de 
                Souza displayed with his great coaching skills.<br>

                I was surrounded by business leaders, but weren’t sitting across 
                a table in an air conditioned office. This topic of discussion 
                were birdies, bunkers, swing plane and fairways. This was my 
                third year participating in the recently concluded OER CEO Golf 
                Event and as always it has been a grand success. After the 9 
                hole game, it was great to team with three non golfers for a few 
                holes and later on with my wife Minita for the Snakes and 
                Ladders game. I look forward to the same event in 2010.<br>

                </b>OER CEO Golf is one of the most sought after event for the 
                corporates of Oman and this year’s edition was par excellence, 
                with so many top honchos under one roof. It was quite good to 
                see so many CEOs, ambassadors all rubbing shoulders with each 
                and making goods use of OER CEO Golf 2009 for networking with 
                new people as well as strengthening old relations. Besides the 
                regular tee off, the other events including the cultural 
                programmes were a treat for everyone. The entire event was 
                meticulously organised and every single details was planned to 
                the tee, as it were. And it seems that there couldn’t be a 
                perfect antidote to dispel the gloom of the global financial 
                crisis than this golfing event which is considered to be the CEO 
                sport. I must admit that all the supporters of the OER CEO Golf 
                2009 got excellent visibility and mileage. <b><br>

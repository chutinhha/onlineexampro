            <b>It was the light frying oil Khafeef that gave a new dimension to 
            the concept of cooking oil and helped Areej Vegetable Oils and 
            Derivatives to jump five ranks on the OER Top 20 list. Visvas Paul D 
            Karra catches up with Prem Maker, Executive Director of the company 
            for a tète-à-tète<br>
            </b>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="cover15.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="379">The 
            year 2008 was a roller coaster year for all commodities. Like the 
            prices of oil, the prices of vegetable oils also shot through the 
            roof during the first half of 2008, peaking in July just as the US 
            sub-prime effect began to extend its vice-like grip on the global 
            economy. But beginning in September 2008, the commodity prices 
            started tumbling and troughed by almost 45 per cent by December. 
            While companies slowed down in line with changing market dynamics, 
            Areej Vegetable Oils &amp; Derivatives (AVOD) moved smoothly ahead like 
            a well-oil production machine.<br>
            <br>
            “The vegetable oil market followed the petroleum oil story and other 
            commodities. Therefore the key was to manage purchasing and buyings 
            to suit the market rather than the interests of speculators. I think 
            we managed it extremely well and finished 2008 with good topline and 
            bottomline results,” says Prem Maker, Executive Director of AVOD. 
            The company’s revenues soared to RO90.68mn in 2008 as compared to 
            RO53mn showing a year-on-year growth of more than 71 per cent.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The ‘Khafeef’ storm<br>
            </b>Apart from the high commodity prices, there are many factors 
            that have contributed to the phenomenal growth of AVOD. One of the 
            most significant features was the launch of corn-oil based frying 
            oil Khafeef Oil in August 2008. At about the same time as the global 
            financial crisis began hitting companies hard, Areej Vegetable Oils 
            took the northern route by introducing its revolutionary product 
            innovation – Khafeef – the lightest frying oil in the GCC. This 
            specialised frying oil was packed in a stylised bottle, which 
            typifies the image of a woman, who is the ultimate user of the 
            product. Explains Maker: “It began with extensive consumer research 
            and evaluation of different oils in actual frying tests conducted 
            with breaded chicken fillet in research labs. Then we invested RO4mn 
            in plant and packaging machinery to deliver on the new technology 
            for this new oil. The finished product, Khafeef, packaged in a 
            beautiful PET bottle, took the market by storm.”<br>
            <br>
            <b>Market leader</b><br>
            Areej Vegetable Oils was established in 1980 with a majority 
            shareholding of the OMZEST Group. It has a modern hygienic plant 
            located at Rusayl Industrial Estate to manufacture and market top 
            quality cooking oils, ghee, margarine, specialty fats and butter 
            products.<br>
            <br>
            The company’s leading brands Minara, Sohar, Khafeef, Jabal Akhdar 
            and Muscat Margarine are trusted names in every Omani home. Areej 
            Vegetable Oils enjoys a 65 per cent market share in Oman and current 
            exports are 70 per cent of the total business. The company exports 
            to 23 countries around the world. Says Maker: “We have done better 
            than our competitors basically because we do not speculate. We 
            follow the basic economics of supply and demand and that is why when 
            the crunch period came, we were not affected seriously. We are 
            manufacturers of a product not speculators.”</font></p>

            <b>Innovation is the key<br>
            </b>Success has followed AVOD mainly through its innovative products 
            and packages which have attracted the customers. Some of the 
            innovations done by the company include the bag-in-carton cooking 
            oil that was a huge success in Oman and UAE. ‘Sohar’ was the first 
            blended oil in the GCC to suit Omani frying habits. ‘Minara’ was the 
            first cooking oil in a crystal clear bottle to make an entry in the 
            GCC market. Furthermore, Minara was the first PET bottle in the GCC 
            with a handle. Exports also got a major fillip with the manufacture 
            and sale of private label brands in PET bottles with handles.<br>
            <br>
            Maker attributes the success of the company basically to a market 
            hunch or in other words matching your business plans to market 
            realities. “We have controlled our cash flows and stocks and we have 
            always been realistic in our expectations, as I had said earlier. 
            Khafeef is a prime example of catering to the market realities and 
            we have achieved tremendous success with this product,” says Maker.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Cost, price effective<br>
            </b>The company continues to grow in new markets with products such 
            as ghee in tins, bag-in-box; polyjars cooking oil in tins; blended 
            oil in clear pet bottles; specialty oils and shortenings etc. 
            Multinationals like Pepsico (Snacks), Unilever and Emborg source 
            their requirements for the Gulf from Areej Vegetable Oils. <br>
            <br>
            Besides product innovations, AVOD has increased its investments in 
            modernisation of plant and upgrading of technology in order to 
            deliver cost effective products to the customers thus delivering 
            more returns to the shareholders. Riding high on its new-found 
            euphoria, Areej Vegetable Oils tasted sweet success again. <br>
            <br>
            While the world shrank into recession, the company expanded its 
            geographical reach to the non-GCC markets and made inroads into Iraq 
            in 2008 itself and increased its market share there by 35-40 per 
            cent. In Oman, AVOD has six major brands of cooking oils, two brands 
            of ghee, and two margarines.</font></p>

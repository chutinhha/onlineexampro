            extreme sports is part and parcel of his weekend routine, says

            <font face="Verdana" size="1">When we walked into Khalid Mohammed Zaman’s unmarked cabin at 
            his office, we found an unassuming young man in his late 20s sitting 
            behind a large working table. As Zaman begins to talk about his 
            company, little do we get an inkling that he is a man who would be a 
            perfect Page 3 material with his modern zeitgeist. However, as 
            director of Al-Zaman Investments, Zaman does not throw caution to 
            the winds and has steered the family owned business safely enough in 
            these turbulent times, but when he is out on a weekend, he is a 
            different personality – a Formula 3 racing driver, a diving 
            enthusiast and a footballer all rolled into one.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Finer things<br>
            </b>And if you throw in his love for exotic food and a game of 
            tennis, you could be forgiven for thinking that Zaman’s passion for 
            life borders on epicurean proportions. Zaman also likes many other 
            finer things of life, like a precision Swiss timepiece for instance. 
            And it is no surprise considering that one of the group company of 
            Al Zaman Investments is the premium Gallery Argan, which deals in 
            jewellery, watches, writing instruments, hi-luxe crystal, silver, 
            leather and Murano products.<br>
            <br>
            “A watch has always been a luxury item and not really to tell or 
            keep time. There are 500 mechanisms in a single Swiss watch and that 
            is quite fascinating,” observes Zaman while commenting that he likes 
            a watch because of the complications of the mechanisms involved to 
            keep it ticking.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Ace racer</b><br>
            Talking about what he does while he is not managing premium brands 
            and ultra luxury items during office hours, Zaman matter of factly 
            states he is a Formula 3 racing driver for the BMW Series, taking 
            part in atleast 10 races at the Bahrain International Circuit. He 
            has obtained an international license as a racing driver and has 
            been on the winning podium two times. Diving is another passion of 
            Zaman, who takes out his Fishing Cruiser boat every Friday in the 
            company of six to seven of his friends for underwater exploration. 
            He has feasted his eyes on some of the rarest underwater life that 
            anyone could ever think of at all the popular dive sites in Oman 
            like Bandar Khairan, Demaniyat Islands, Halaniyat Islands etc. It is 
            a very calming and invigorating experience to watch rare fish like 
            sea snakes, the menacing leopard sharks etc, he says.<br>
            <br>
            “Family values are very dear to me and I believe that education is 
            utterly important for an individual’s growth and helps him to 
            explore new horizons,” says Zaman on a more serious note when asked 
            about what he cherishes most in life. Carrying forward his love for 
            exotic food, Zaman also hopes to start concept restaurants like a 
            sushi bar etc.<br>

                The Middle East isn’t exactly known for its pleasant summers. 
                But thankfull we can more than cope with the heat thanks to an, 
                often overlooked, invention called the air conditioner. But how 
                did they come into existence and who was the true inventor of 
                the air conditioner? Read on to find out. First and foremost, 
                before we go into the business breakdown of air conditioners, 
                let us explain how it all began and how the modern air con came 
                into existence.<br>
                <br>
                While air conditioning itself is a relatively new invention, the 
                cooling of buildings is not. It is known that wealthy ancient 
                Romans used aqueducts to circulate water through walls to cool 
                their luxurious houses. Even as far back as the 2nd century 
                china there have been records of some form of air conditioning. 
                It is recorded that inventor Ding Huan, of the Han Dynasty, 
                invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3 
                m in diameter and was manually powered. In 747, Emperor Xuanzong 
                of the Tang Dynasty had a Cool Hall, called Liang Tian, built in 
                the imperial palace and was said to have water-powered fan 
                wheels for air conditioning as well as a rising jet streams of 
                water from fountains. During the subsequent Song Dynasty, 
                written records mentioned the widespread use of rotary fan as a 
                means of air conditioning.<br>
                <br>
                Even medieval Persia was said to have some sort of cooling 
                system for buildings during hot weather seasons. They used 
                cisterns, which were large open pools in the central courtyards 
                used to collect rain water, in conjunction with impressive wind 
                towers. These wind towers had windows to catch the wind which 
                was then directed, using internal vanes, down into the building, 
                over the cistern and out through a downwind cooling tower. As 
                the cistern water evaporated it cooled the air inside the 
                building.<br>
                <br>
                In 1200AD, Abd al-Latif al-Baghda described the use of 
                ventilators in various households in Egypt. He reported that 
                almost every house in Cairo has a ventilator, and that they cost 
                anywhere from 1 to 500 dinars depending on their sizes and 
                shapes. In fact it is said that Ventilators were actually 
                invented in medieval Egypt.<br>
                <br>
                But it was only in 1820 that British scientist and inventor 
                Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying 
                ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed 
                to evaporate. In 1842, a Florida physician John Gorrie used 
                compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air 
                for his patients in his hospital. He hoped eventually to use his 
                ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings and 
                even envisioned centralised air conditioning that could cool 
                entire cities. Although his prototype leaked and performed 
                irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his 
                ice-making machine. Unfortunately, any hopes for its success 
                soon vanished with the death of his chief financial backer; 
                without the money he needed there was no way to develop the 
                machine commercially. According to his biographer, Vivian M. 
                Sherlock, he blamed the “Ice King”, Frederic Tudor, for his 
                failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a smear campaign 
                against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855 and 
                the idea of air conditioning faded with him for the next 50 
                years.<br>
                <br>
                In 1902 the first modern electrical air conditioning was 
                invented by Willis Haviland Carrier. Designed to improve 
                manufacturing process control in a printing plant, his invention 
                controlled not only temperature but also humidity. The low heat 
                and humidity were to help maintain consistent paper dimensions 
                and ink alignment. Later Carrier’s technology was applied to 
                increase productivity in the workplace. This led to the 
                formation of The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America to 
                meet rising demand. In 1906 Stuart W. Cramer was exploring ways 
                to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined 
                the term “air conditioning”, using it in a patent claim he filed 
                that year. He combined moisture with the ventilation to 
                “condition” (This evaporation of water in air, to provide a 
                cooling effect, is now known as evaporative cooling) and change 
                the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary 
                in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term “air 
                conditioning” and incorporated it into the name of his company. 
                Early commercial applications of air conditioning were primarily 
                to provide cool air for industrial processing rather than 
                personal comfort but over time air conditioning came to be used 
                to improve comfort in homes and later in automobiles. In fact it 
                wasn’t until the 1950s that Residential sales expanded 
                dramatically.<br>
                <br>
                The first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or 
                flammable gases like ammonia, methyl chloride, and propane which 
                could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, 
                Jr. created the first chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon, in 1928. 
                The refrigerant was much safer for humans but was later found to 
                be harmful to the atmosphere which resulted biological 
                consequences including an increase in skin cancer, damage to 
                plants, and the reduction of ocean plankton.<br>
                <br>
                Freon is a trademark name of DuPont (an American chemical 
                company) for any Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), Hydrogenated CFC (HCFC), 
                or Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The blend most used in 
                direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC 
                known as R-22. It is to be phased out for use in new equipment 
                by 2010 and completely discontinued by 2020. Several non-ozone 
                depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, 
                including R-410A, invented by Honeywell in Buffalo NY and sold 
                under the Genetron AZ-20 name.<br>
                <br>
                Innovation in air conditioning technologies continue, with much 
                recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency and improving indoor 
                air quality. As an alternative to conventional refrigerants, 
                natural alternatives like CO2 (R-744) have been proposed. We 
                only have to wait and see what comes of it.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The Current Business of Commercial Cooling</b><br>
                While globally the air-conditioning market is growing by leaps 
                and bounds, in countries such as the Middle East the segment has 
                witnessed enormous growth. In the GCC for instance, massive 
                construction drives spurring the development of numerous 
                residential and commercial real estate projects and high 
                population growth have fuelled demand for air-conditioners and 
                cooling systems.<br>
                <br>
                The boom in real estate development together with the growing 
                emphasis on greater cooling facilities and the resultant 
                increase in power demand have all contributed to creating huge 
                opportunities for manufactures and distributors in district 
                cooling. This trend has received added impetus in recent years 
                with the lack of sufficient generation, transmission and 
                distribution infrastructure to meet projected power demands.<br>
                <br>
                The Middle East has been a major market for air-conditioners, 
                coolants and refrigerators, chiefly due to the region’s arid 
                climatic conditions. However, in recent times, other factors 
                have been reinforcing the market’s growth in the segment. These 
                include improvements in lifestyle, the mushrooming of numerous 
                malls and hypermarkets all over the region and other 
                developmental activities, all of which has spurred demand for 
                air-conditioning products.<br>
                <br>
                “Air conditioners have come a long way from being just a cooling 
                machine. Today we have models that can detect and eliminate 
                deadly disease causing agents like SARS and bird-flu virus and 
                other harmful pathogens this is done through a technology called 
                MPI [Micro Plasma Ion], a world’s first from SAMSUNG,” says Ajay 
                Ganti, General Manager, SARCO distributors for SAMSUNG in Oman.<br>
                <br>
                He goes on to add that newer models of air-conditioners 
                “incorporate what is called GOOD SLEEP MODE, which senses your 
                body temperature to regulate the room temperature. There is a 
                lot of focus on hygiene and health. There is also a lot of 
                impetus on the design accent to turn the air-conditioner into a 
                piece of art, to make it a part of your interior decor. So 
                basically, the AC is a lifestyle product rather than just a 
                cooling product”.<br>
                <br>
                In Oman, the air-conditioner and refrigerator market account for 
                a whopping 65 to 70 per cent of all business in the white goods 
                market. “The market size of air-conditioning products is around 
                200 K units a year in Oman. The market size for Refrigerators is 
                around 80 K units a year. Also due to a very fertile commercial 
                / industrial projects scenario,there is also a great business 
                opportunity for different air-conditioning concepts like 
                chiller, ducted type or DVM(digital Variable Multi),” says Ganti. 
                Traditionally, the Sultanate has been a market for window ACs. 
                That trend is rapidly changing as improved standards of living 
                and more sophisticated lifestyles push customer preference to 
                split and ducted air-conditioners. This is in line with global 
                trends. Apart from lifestyle changes and economic development, 
                price reductions in split units have driven demand for these 
                models of air-conditioners. What’s more, the air-conditioner 
                which was earlier regarded as a seasonal product now boasts 
                decent sales figures even during off-season. In Oman extreme 
                temperatures and high levels of humidity have spurred the demand 
                for high quality, energy efficient, environment friendly and 
                reliable cooling solutions. The Omani government, in keeping 
                with these trends and demands, has established the highest 
                standards in setting requirements for all new projects being 
                developed for both the tourism and real estate sectors.<br>
                <br>
                In order to meet these requirements and to reduce the demand on 
                the governments for energy the District Cooling solution has 
                been developed and implemented throughout the GCC.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<div align="center">

                      The performance and quality of air conditioning greatly 
                      depends on compressor, the heart of air conditioning, and 
                      its conditioner. Panasonic has been supplying Super 
                      Tropical compressor for improvement of living environment 
                      since 2001. This compressor has a high efficiency compared 
                      to reciprocating type compressors and therefore achieves 
                      high efficiency under high load conditions. Also, 
                      Panasonic has found a way to triple the life of their 
                      condensers, using a layer of their original anti-rust 
                      coating. This special coating lets you enjoy more years of 
                      reliable comfort plus extra economy over the long run. 
                      Panasonic’s condenser has 3 times higher resistance 
                      against corrosion. This special coating assures longer 
                      condenser live for years of reliable comfort.</font></td>

                      Samsung offers wide range of Commercial Air conditioners 
                      in Ducted Split and Cassette type units. In Ducted Split 
                      type segment, Samsung offers 18k~72k Btu/h Capacity which 
                      is consisting of Side and Top discharge unit and in 
                      Cassette type, 18k to 48k Btu/h capacity 4 way type. Among 
                      all these products, Samsung Top discharge outdoor unit 
                      provides more flexibility for installation with piping of 
                      maximum 50 metres between indoor and outdoor unit. 
                      Further, it occupies the lowest installation space. Its 
                      foot print area is 43% smaller, in comparison to 
                      competitor’s outdoor units of the same capacity. In 
                      addition to this Samsung’s top discharge out door unit is 
                      adapting a flare type connection. As a result it doesn’t 
                      require welding when it is installed and because of its 
                      flare type service valve, installation time is faster than 
                      the welding type and there are no impurities and oxides in 
                      the pipes caused by welding. Also, in order to fit your 
                      building requirements, you can choose either the top 
                      discharge outdoor unit or the side discharge outdoor unit.

                      <b>SHARP Air Conditioners – Healthy Lining. </b><br>
                      Sharp has always been an innovative brand. Their 
                      PlasmaCluster air conditioners is just another from the 
                      host of other innovations. By releasing cluster ions in 
                      the room, Sharp’s PlasmaCluster air conditioners replicate 
                      the nature-like situation as they have been adapted by 
                      studying nature. One of the factors that saves mother 
                      earth from toxic elements being bombarded from atmosphere 
                      is the presence of PlasmaCluster ions in the stratosphere 
                      which detoxify the toxic air. This technology exclusively 
                      used by Sharp is certified worldwide by various 
                      institutions including Asthma Society of Canada and 
                      British Allergy Council. <br>
                      <br>
                      Sharp’s PlasmaCluster Ions are the combination of positive 
                      and negative ions. The positive Ions deactivate viruses, 
                      bacteria, molds and undesirable odours. In contrast, 
                      negative ions have the effect of only refreshing the air 
                      in a room. <br>
                      <br>
                      Current medical practice to fight the influenza virus 
                      involves treatments using inactivated vaccines and/or 
                      anti-influenza drugs that prevent infection by the virus 
                      by inactivating it in the body, and a great deal of 
                      research is being conducted in this area. In contrast, 
                      Sharp has developed the world’s first technology to 
                      inactivate the Influenza virus (which spreads by aerial 
                      infection) directly in the air. It is now possible to 
                      prevent influenza infections at homes that may cause 
                      serious health problems. Furthermore, the effectiveness of 
                      this technology is proven against bird flu virus. Oman

                maintenance of an AC is an area that most consumers and 
                commercial clients need to learn about. It is not always 
                necessary to order dealer service when a little bit of care and 
                maintenance on your part will go a long way in improving the 
                working life of your air conditioner<br>
                <br>
                Simple things such as regular cleaning of the filters, helps 
                increase the life of your AC. However, it is more prudent for 
                you to enter into an annual maintenance contract with the 
                authorised service centre of your brand of AC, so that the units 
                are maintained at a nominal cost with little hassle. The 
                following few tips will help one maintain an air-conditioner in 
                an easy simple way:<br>
                <br>
                Understand that an air conditioner, apart from cooling, also 
                conditions the air inside your room like humidity, dust, order, 
                fungus, bacteria, etc. All good quality ACs have cooling, 
                humidity control, dust removal, anti fungal and anti-bacterial 
                functions and these need to be used properly.<br>
                <br>
                Split ACs are now affordable, very quiet and energy saving as 
                compared to window ACs. They are also more hygienic and prevent 
                birds from making their nests in air gaps, rodents creeping in 
                and air from leaking.<br>
                <br>
                Clean the filter of your AC once a fortnight, or when the 
                indicator lamp on the front panel lights up. Dirty air filters 
                force your system to work harder to push cool air through your 
                home. This uses more energy and places extra strain on the air 
                conditioning system. Take the filter(s) out and hold it to the 
                light. If the dust on the filter is so think that you can’t see 
                much light shining through the filter, it’s time for new 
                filters. A clean air filter, unobstructed by the dirt and other 
                debris, will save you money on energy costs and prolong the life 
                of your air conditioner. If you do not know where your air 
                filters are or how to replace them, ask your HVAC technician to 
                show you during an inspection.<br>
                <br>
                Keep the doors of your rooms open for a few minutes every day to 
                allow some fresh air to enter. Do not spray any type of 
                deodorant or perfume into your split ACs. Doing so will result 
                in foul smell, necessitating a cleaning of the indoor unit.<br>
                <br>
                Avoid smoking in an AC room as indirect smoke can harm other 
                family members and it is very difficult to remove the odour even 
                by servicing.<br>
                <br>
                For safety, always turn the thermostat and outdoor unit’s 
                breaker off before doing any work around that outdoor unit. The 
                coil can be cleaned using a soft-bristle brush to gently sweep 
                the fins. Always brush in line with the fins, and be gentle 
                because the fins can bend easily. Because the fan pulls air 
                through these fins, you can expect to find dust clinging to the 
                fins. Removing this dust and other debris will reduce resistance 
                and increase efficiency.<br>
                <br>
                If you smell bad odour, it normally will not be from your AC but 
                from your carpet, curtains, linen, excessive sweat, etc. 
                However, if the filter is not cleaned routinely or the drainage 
                is clogged and water remains in the drain pan for long, it can 
                cause foul smell. Here, it is essential that the drainpipe be 
                connected properly to prevent foul smell from entering through 
                the pipe.<br>
                <br>
                Keep the exhaust fan of your bathrooms ON when you are at home.<br>
                <br>
                Keep the split AC ON even when you are out of home at a 
                temperature of 27 degree C. This will keep your home cool and 
                healthy, especially when the outside temperature is above 42 
                degree C, with high humidity. A good quality AC is meant to be 
                ON 24 hours a day.<br>
                <br>
                In Oman today, an AC is needed for not more than seven months a 
                year. Using the AC when indoor temperature is less than 25 
                degree C is a waste of energy. Between November and March, do 
                not switch ON the AC in fan mode, instead use a ceiling fan that 
                will give you comfortable and natural sleep.<br>
                <br>
                When the outside temperature goes above 42 degree C, keep the 
                bedroom and living room ACs ON at a temperature setting of 27 
                degree C even if you are out of the room. This will prevent the 
                room walls and roof from becoming excessively hot. Hot walls and 
                roof lead to continuous running of the AC’s compressor, 
                resulting in excessive power consumption and inefficient 
                cooling. When you re-enter the room, you can adjust the 
                temperature settings. Your electricity bills will not be high as 
                the compressor will shut down on reaching the set temperature. 
                At such times, the AC can be turned off after 10 PM as the room 
                temperature will remain at around 25 degree C and a ceiling fan 
                running at slow speed will give you comfortable sleep. <br>
                <br>
                If you own a villa, plant trees around the building, as these 
                can help you save on your electricity bills.<br>
                <br>
                Insulate your rooftop professionally and use good quality 
                insulated bricks for the walls. Use thick curtains so that the 
                heat rays do not enter the house / flat. Keep the outdoor unit 
                of your split air conditioner in a shaded area or place it in 
                such a way that afternoon sunlight does not hit it directly. <br>
                <br>
                Get the AC checked and serviced by your distributor once a year 
                for any gas leak and get the outdoor unit washed using high 
                pressure water. This will help you save on your electricity 
                bills. Cleaning the filter every fortnight is very important to 
                save energy. Users themselves can do filter cleaning and use 
                service centres for other routine services.<br>

                      floor standing (2 ton and 4 ton) with both compressor 
                      types. Gree is also into chillers and ductable (package 
                      units) besides manufacturing air-conditioners.</font></td>

                jargon</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
                <b>You may have heard of terms like BTU, tonne, etc., when you 
                talk about ACs, but do not know what they mean? Get to know 
                industry jargon that will help you select an AC or refrigeration 
                product that best meets your needs<br>
                </b><br>
                <b>What size air conditioner do I need?<br>
                </b>The cooling capacity of an air conditioner is measured in 
                British Thermal Units (BTU) and the capacity you require depends 
                mostly on the size of the room you need to cool. If you buy an 
                air conditioner that is too small, it will not cool adequately. 
                If you buy one that is too large, the air conditioner will cool 
                the room before it dehumidifies and this can leave you feeling 
                clammy. For larger areas, sometimes, two smaller units are more 
                efficient than one large unit. Your dealer will have additional 
                details.<br>
                <br>
                <b>How often should I clean the filter?<br>
                </b>To ensure maximum cooling capacity and efficiency, you 
                should keep the filter clean. During peak usage times, the 
                filter should be inspected on a weekly basis to make sure that 
                it is not clogged with dust. <br>
                <br>
                <b>What does EER mean?</b><br>
                The EER, or Energy-Efficiency Rating, measures an air 
                conditioner’s energy consumption and efficiency. A higher EER 
                rating means that your AC is consuming less energy.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What is the tonnage in ACs?</b><br>
                The unit of measure used in air conditioning to describe the 
                cooling capacity of a system. One ton of cooling is based on the 
                amount of heat needed to melt one ton (2000 lbs) of ice in a 24 
                hour period. One ton of cooling is equal to 12,000 Btu/hr.<br>

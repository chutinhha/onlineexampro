                prices and good quarter one 2009 results helped the MSM to break 
                a 10-month long bear run<br>
                </b><br>
                The MSM30 benchmark index rose 8.2 per cent for the month ended 
                15th April 2009, after nearly ten months of consecutive losses. 
                The rally was lead by the banking and industrial sector stocks. 
                Service sector index somewhat offset the significant gains 
                recorded by the other two sectoral indices. Market activity 
                improved as volumes increased by 59.3 per cent while average 
                turnover per day increased by 112 per cent for the same period, 
                to RO9.33mn. The market rose on the back of stable oil prices 
                and greater visibility in earnings of the listed companies. 
                Investor’s confidence seemed to have picked up given attractive 
                valuation of blue chip stocks. Market breath was favourable with 
                an advance decline ratio of 1:1. <br>

                <b>Leading the charge<br>
                </b>The index heavy weights that lead the rally were ONIC 
                holding (104 per cent) Bank Muscat (+31.7 per cent) and Oman 
                Emirates (+37.89 per cent). In key corporate events, Bank Muscat 
                informed the market that it has sold approximately 81 per cent 
                of its stake in HDFC Bank, India. The pre-tax profit on the sale 
                of this stake is approximately RO39mn and will be reflected in 
                the first quarter results. Majan Glass announced that the 
                company has started commercial production of its fifth 
                production line.

                <b>GCC markets rebound</b><br>
                The month ended April 15, 2009 was a positive month for the GCC 
                markets and the benchmark MSCI GCC index increased by 15.94 per 
                cent. The Saudi stock exchange was the top gainer and the index 
                increased by 25.60 per cent during the month. The banking and 
                petrochemical counters among other boarder indices were the top 
                gainers during the month. Rise in oil prices coupled with 
                encouraging announcements by petrochemical companies led to the 
                positive sentiment among investors. The Qatar and Abu Dhabi 
                exchanges too ended on a positive note with the respective 
                indices gaining 13.99 per cent and 13.66 per cent. The 
                industrial and banking counters were among the top gainers on 
                both the exchanges. The Kuwaiti stock exchange rose by 11.68 per 
                cent with the broader sectoral indices ending mixed. Banking 
                counters were among the top gainers on the exchange. The Emir 
                approved an injection of KWD4bn into the banking sector as 
                deposits, which should boost the lending capacity of banks.<br>
                <br>
                The Dubai Financial Market saw a rise of 10.66 per cent with the 
                construction and real estate counters ending up on the exchange. 
                The Bahrain Stock exchange was a slow mover among the rest of 
                the GCC markets and the general index ended up 5.18 per cent 
                during the month. Rising oil and commodity prices coupled with 
                various government initiatives to boost investors’ sentiments 
                was the prime reason for the surge in the GCC markets. Moreover, 
                investors created new positions in anticipation of strong 1Q09 
                results. Going ahead, Q1 results and global news flow should 
                provide direction to the GCC markets.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oman doesn't have a lot of oil by Middle East standards. With only five billion barrels of proven oil reserves, it is estimated that the Sultanate's wells will run dry in 17 years.&nbsp;<br>

                    Or is it?<br>

                    "It's not as simple as that," says His Excellency Dr Mohammed bin Hamad Al Rumhy, Oman's Minister for Oil and Gas.<br>

                    "The estimate is a statistical figure based on what the industry calls a recovery factor, and the average recovery factor in Oman is very small."<br>

                    But new technologies, he says, are improving recovery techniques all the time.&nbsp;<br>

                    In an exclusive interview with OER, His Excellency reveals that Oman now expects to extract a lot more oil than previously thought.<br>

                    <br>

                    The Sultanate sits on nearly 50 billion barrels of oil, but the majority of it is unlikely to see the light of day.<br>

                    "This oil is not a pool," Rumhy explains. "It sits in rocks and you can never get all of it out. It's impossible. It's like spilling milk on a piece of rock and trying to retrieve it."<br>

                    Since Oman discovered oil in 1962, 6.1 billion barrels have been extracted, or just over 12 per cent of the total resource base (see graph).&nbsp;<br>

                    Until now, that Sultanate has estimated it can extract a further 10 per cent, or five billion barrels.<br>

                    "This is what we've been telling people are our reserves," Rumhy says.&nbsp;<br>

                    "But using today's technology, we are confident that we can increase this by another four billion barrels, or another eight per cent."<br>

                    That means that if production rates remain the same, Oman will be able to produce oil for almost twice as long as previously estimated - no small matter when you consider oil accounts for 80 per cent of export revenue and about 40 per cent of gross domestic product.&nbsp;</font></p>

                    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="../../images/2001_july_august/im2.jpg" width="300" height="226"></font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rumhy briefed His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said on the encouraging news in June. And he says the four billion barrel increase in recoverable reserves is just the beginning.&nbsp;<br>

                    "My message is, 50 years from today we will still be producing oil."<br>

                    The challenge, he says, is to extract 50 per cent of the oil in the ground.&nbsp;<br>

                    "If we could do that our proven reserves would become almost 25 billion barrels, of which we have produced six billion. So if we find a solution, we will be able to tell people that our proven reserves are almost 20 billion barrels. And if you divide that by the current production, I bet the figure of 17 years will suddenly triple to 50."<br>

                    But Oman is not just improving its oil recovery factor, it is also looking for new oil fields, and Rumhy is equally confident of success on the exploration front.<br>

                    "We are learning more every day, not just on how to extract it, but how to find it. We are still being surprised by the complex geology of Oman, so I am sure we will find more," he says.<br>

                    "Oman geology is changing the theory of oil exploration, because for the first time we see oil where the old school of thought is telling us that oil shouldn't exist.<br>

                    "That is both challenging, expensive, difficult, but at the same time very promising."<br>

                    Oman recently signed a new concession agreement with Danish company Maersk to explore for oil near the border with Saudi Arabia. Rumhy says two more concession agreements are in the pipeline and should be signed within months.<br>

                    "These companies are expert at producing oil in difficult places, so we are very optimistic."</font></p>

                    For a token rental, an oil company is assigned a block of land in Oman to explore, typically of several thousands square kilometers. The company bears the initial exploration costs, making the search for oil relatively cheap for the Government. In the event of success, the first oil pumped from a newly-discovered well is used to pay all expenses incurred by the oil company. After that, the Government takes its share of the oil

                            - usually between 60 and 80 per cent - and the oil company keeps the rest.&nbsp;</font></td>

              </table>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even so, by Gulf standards Oman remains an oil-producing minnow. Its reserves pale in comparison to those of neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which sits on 259 billion barrels of proven oil reserves - more than a quarter of the world total - and up to one trillion barrels of ultimately recoverable oil.&nbsp;<br>

                    Where Saudi produces more than nine million barrels of oil a day, Oman produces less than one million.<br>

                    The Sultanate knows that even if its oil lasts a lot longer than originally thought, it will eventually have to find other sources of income. For this reason, it has embarked on a progressive programme to diversify its economy away from oil. And central to that diversification programme is gas.<br>

                    "We keep on being reminded that we only have 17 years before we run out of oil," Rumhy says with a wry smile, "so gas is really going to play a big role here. If we are to go industrial in this country, we need power. Gas will give us that option."<br>

                    More and more natural gas is being discovered in Oman, and the Sultanate's proven gas reserves of 22 trillion cubic feet are expected to continue to swell in coming years.&nbsp;<br>

                    This year Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), which explores for natural gas on behalf of the Government, announced the discovery of what is potentially the largest gas field found in Oman in the last six years.<br>

                    <br>

                    Gas is increasingly being used to develop new industries and create much-needed jobs, for example by establishing fertiliser, methanol and petrochemical plants.<br>

                    And Rumhy says two major gas pipelines currently under construction will speed the transformation of the Omani economy when they open in late 2002.&nbsp;<br>

                    The pipes will link Oman's gas fields to the southern port city Salalah and to Sohar in the north, effectively covering the entire Sultanate.<br>

                    "This will break the chicken and egg story," Rumhy says.&nbsp;<br>

                    "In the past, if people wanted to set up an industry they asked for gas. And when the Government looked at new pipeline projects, the first thing it asked was where is the industry?'. "Fortunately we have broken this cycle of thinking, and I am sure once investors see the availability of gas anywhere in Oman, they will want to tap in."<br>

                    <img border="0" src="../../images/2001_july_august/im3.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="234">Gas is also becoming an increasingly important export commodity for Oman.&nbsp;<br>

                    The Sultanate began supplying Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to customers in Korea and Japan early last year. Rumhy says that in an increasingly environmentally-conscious world, sales of clean-burning LNG have enormous growth potential and could account for as much as 10 per cent of Government revenues within a decade.<br>

                    "I think gas is the energy of the future," he says.&nbsp;<br>

                    "Until we manage to come up with a technology that makes coal clean, people will think gas. The Chinese are thinking gas, and so are the Indians, so that's a potential market for us, and there are others as well."<br>

                    Oman is looking to emerging markets in Asia such as Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as potential gas customers, he says.<br>

                    "These are very entrepreneurial people, and they work very hard. As soon as they sort out a few of their internal problems, we will see incredible growth coming from those countries."</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Government is close to proceeding with a third gas liquefaction train at Oman LNG's plant in Qalhat - already the largest operative gas liquefying plant in the world.<br>

                    "There are small delays because with gas, unlike oil, you first sell and then you develop," he explains. "We are at that stage of selling. Until we secure the market, we cannot physically start the project.<br>

                    "But a lot of work has been done.&nbsp;<br>

                    "The engineering behind the third train is ongoing, it's almost finished. So hopefully towards the end of this year we will make a decision based on the marketing issues. If marketing is successful, by the end of this year we should start serious work."</font></p>

                    But the 45-year-old father of two is humble when it comes to his own involvement in the huge strides Oman is making.<br>

                    With a PhD in Petroleum Engineering, he spent six years working with PDO and seven years teaching at Sultan Qaboos University before being appointed Minister for Oil and Gas in 1997.&nbsp;<br>

                    But he says he feels "lucky" to have the portfolio and the opportunity to work "on the front line".<br>

                    "The troops in the front line are only safe if they have a good general at the back, and the people's support," he says.&nbsp;<br>

                    "There are people supporting us all the way from school teachers to nurses, even the guys who sweep our streets - because we are very proud of our streets - and so the list continues. It's a national effort, and it's a good feeling.&nbsp;<br>

                    "We are not politicians, many of us, we are just people who work hard, trying our best to make sure that our kids' future is secure. Hopefully we will succeed."<br>

                    And then he smiles.<br>

                    "Seventeen years from today, if we're still telling people that we'll run out of oil in 17 years, I'll be a very happy man," he says, knowing full well that he will be.</font></p>

                    "see&quot; what is underground. Techniques such as "integrated subsurface modelling&quot;, which combines detailed field geology models with simulated oil, gas and water flow, have enabled Petroleum Development Oman to add hundreds of millions of barrels of oil to the country's reserves. They have also resulted in accelerated production, and prevented the drilling of unnecessary wells.<br>

                    The ability to maximise production from existing fields is as important as finding and developing new ones. The Yibal field - Oman's largest - is a good example of how the application of new technology can breathe new life into a field whose production was expected to decline. More than 30 years after Yibal came on stream, it still accounts for about a fifth of PDO's total production. In the 1990s horizontal wells halved the field's per-barrel production cost. More recently, multi-lateral wells, which have multiple offshoots emanating from a single main well, have halved the cost again.<br>

                    The Internet is also opening up new possibilities in oil and gas exploration, allowing engineers around the world to communicate and share information instantaneously. The development of the recently-discovered Al Noor field in Oman is a good example. The Al Noor reservoir rock is extremely compact, presenting particular problems for production. A worldwide virtual team worked to unlock the complex geology of the rock, which can be visualised on computers in three dimensions. Techniques such as seismic imagining and massive fracturing of the rock ultimately made it possible to produce oil and gas economically from the field.</font></td>

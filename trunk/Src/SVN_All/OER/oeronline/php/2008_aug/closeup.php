<b>By Dr Jasim Husain Ali</b></font></font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Doing away with inflation in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations is 
undoubtedly a daunting task. Increasingly, double-digit inflation rates are 
becoming a norm in the GCC economies. Last year, Qatar and the UAE suffered from 
inflation rates of 14 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.<br>
<br>
Inflation rate in Saudi Arabia stood at 10.5 per cent in April. Kuwaiti 
inflation rate was 10.4 per cent in February. It reached a record 12.4 per cent 
in Oman in April. Notwithstanding official figures, inflation rate in Bahrain is 
believed to have passed 10 per cent in the last few months.<br>
<br>
Just a few years ago, inflation was not a problem to be reckoned with in the GCC 
economies. According to Merrill Lynch, inflation rate averaged 0.3 per cent in 
2001, only to increase to 6.3 per cent in 2007. The IMF put inflation rate of 7 
per cent in the six-nation GCC last year, only to raise it to 8 per cent by 2008 
end. </font><p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

<b>Chief culprits <br>
</b>Studies and reports suggest that housing and food costs are chiefly 
responsible for the growing inflationary pressures. In Saudi Arabia, rents, fuel 
and water costs increased by 18.5 per cent in May. Food and beverages grew by 
15.1 per cent in the same period. With regards to inflation in Kuwait in 
February, rental rates increased by some 16 per cent, followed by rise of 15 per 
cent in drinks and tobacco products and 9 per cent in food stuffs.<br>
<br>
By one account, imported inflation is responsible for as much as 30 per cent of 
overall inflationary pressures encircling regional economies. This is a 
consequence of having GCC currencies linked to the US dollar, which in turn 
suffers from declining value. Currencies not linked to the dollar have 
appreciated in value over the past few years. For example, the value of Chinese 
currency (yuan) increased by almost 7 per cent in 2007. The yuan appreciated by 
almost the same value in the first half of 2008 alone. Also, the Euro has risen 
by 40 per cent in five years. At the moment, merely 0.73 euro cents can buy a US 
dollar. In 2003, 1.20 Euro was required to purchase a dollar. All said, GCC 
economies are dependent on imports from euro-zone countries and China for a 
considerable amount of their needs for vehicles, machineries and toys, to name a 
few.<br>
<br>
The rise in property prices reflects failure of supply meeting demand. Rising 
demand reflects availability of liquidity on the back of firm oil prices and 
other limited investment alternatives. Many investors like to invest in property 
market as they expect to make attractive returns&#8722;as much as 40 per cent per 
annum. Yet, corrections of the stock markets in 2006 are serving as a reminder 
of the dangers associated of placing funds in bourses.<br>
<br>
<b>Enemy within</b><br>
A significant portion of inflationary pressure stems from domestic economic 
conditions, namely the fiscal policy. Reference is made to the sharp growth of 
public sector spending in the GCC economies, which averaged around 17 per cent 
in 2007. In contrast, budgetary expenditures grew by merely 3 per cent in 2002. 
(the two years don’t compare) The extraordinary growth of public expenditures is 
the direct result of stronger oil revenues. Yet, the governments have no choice 
but to invest rising oil proceeds on infrastructure projects such as road 
network, airport expansion and utilities to offset demand. The increasing demand 
is not met by similar growth of supply, thereby causing shortage and subsequent 
rise in prices.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the authorities are using part of extra oil proceeds to help 
locals adjust to inflationary pressures. All GCC governments have increased 
public sector salaries in the last 12 months. Only in June, Kuwaiti authorities 
agreed to a demand made by the newly elected parliament to increase salary of 
Kuwaiti nationals working in both public and private sectors by KD50 (US$182) 
for those earning less than KD1,000 monthly.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, M2 or broad money supply is growing at exceptionally high 
rates. The growth averaged around 30 per cent in 2007, up from 10 per cent in 
2003. M2 consists of currency outside the banking system plus private demand and 
savings (short and long-term). The growth of M2 reflects the mood amongst the 
consumers and investors in the region.<br>
<br>
<b>Undermining monetary union</b><br>
Growing inflationary pressures could derail the planned monetary union by 2010. 
Recently, the UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan bin Nasser Al Suweidi pointed out 
that inflation was causing differences of opinion within the regional grouping. 
He went on to suggest that the inflation factor could defer issuance of a single 
currency by the target date.<br>
<br>
In reality, inflation is a serious concern when it comes to meeting one such 
condition attached to the monetary union project, namely limiting that to the 
average rate in member states plus two per cent. According to the IMF, inflation 
rates amounted to 14 per cent and 4.1 per cent in 2007 in Qatar and Saudi 
Arabia, respectively. In 2006, Oman advised of its desire not to join the 
monetary union in a foresighted move.<br>
<br>
<b>Kuwait’s experience</b><br>
Kuwait remains an exception by having its currency linked to a basket of 
currencies since May 2007. Still, it is believed that the US dollar constitutes 
some 60 per cent of all currencies included in the basket. So is the case due to 
the significance of the dollar in Kuwait’s weighted international trade, notably 
the hydrocarbons industry.<br>
<br>
At any rate, according to a report issued by Central Bank of Kuwait, inflation 
rate stood at a whopping 10.4 per cent in February. In contrast, inflation rates 
amounted to 9.5 per cent in January and still a lower 7.5 per cent in December 
2007. <br>
<br>
The Kuwaiti experience shows that a single measure, namely ending the peg to the 
dollar, could not contain inflationary pressures. Thus, de-linking the 
currencies with the dollar could not fully overcome inflationary pressures. 
Declining value of the US dollar is merely part of the problem. Another 
challenge concerns expansionary fiscal policy through higher allocations for 
capital and current expenditures. In turn, this is constrained by limited 
monetary policy options to affect economic conditions by virtue of importing 
interest rates prevailing in the US and absence of taxation. <br>

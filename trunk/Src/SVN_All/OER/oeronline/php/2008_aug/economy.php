<b>Oman’s fight against inflation has been intensified, showing just how seriously 
the authorities take the problem and its impact on Omanis. The key to easing 
medium-term price pressures, though, may lie in global factors as much as 
domestic strategy</b><br>

<img border="0" src="cover15.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="122" height="146"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">In the first quarter of 2008, Oman’s inflation hit an 18-year high of 10.6per 
cent according to a statement from the Ministry of National Economy, and jumped 
even further to 13.2 per cent in the year to May. Inflation has been driven by a 
number of factors, both international and domestic.<br>
<br>
Global prices have been driven upwards by the rising cost of fuel, food and 
other commodities. Crude oil has hit $135 a barrel by some measures, pushing up 
transport costs, which feed through across the economy. Food price inflation has 
been stimulated by changing consumption trends (more meat being eaten, for 
example), climatic factors and the headlong rush to cultivate biofuels in North 
America and Europe. Meanwhile, an emerging market construction boom, 
particularly in China, has been instrumental in increasing the price of 
construction materials, including steel.<br>
<br>
A handful of domestic (or at least regional) factors have also contributed to 
Oman’s inflationary spike. The Sultanate, like its Gulf neighbours, has 
experienced an influx of liquidity over the past few years thanks to soaring oil 
earnings, contributing strongly to demand pull. Economic success has gone 
hand-in-hand with credit growth, increasing the narrow money supply 
considerably. According to a June 11 report by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), 
the level of outstanding credit rose to $19.4 bn in the year to end-August, an 
increase of 49.7 per cent in the last year, with loans to the private sector 
accounting for 94 per cent of this total.<br>
<br>
Another demand pull dynamic is demographic. The population has also been 
increasing quickly – by 3.2 per cent last year, according to the CIA – due to 
the fast-growing National population and an influx of expatriates drawn to the 
thriving economy. Somewhat more controversially, it is apparent that Oman’s 
dollar peg is also contributing to inflation. The rial’s peg to the greenback 
effectively obliges the CBO to shadow the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate 
policy. Given the US slowdown and credit crunch, the Fed has been assiduously 
cutting rates in recent months in an effort to stimulate growth. At the time of 
writing the Fed’s rate stood at 2 per cent, down from 5.25 per cent in 
mid-September 2007. While this policy may suit the US, it is the opposite to 
what the Omani economy needs – namely moderate increases to rein in exuberance.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, with the dollar dropping steadily in value over the past three 
years, imports priced in other currencies (particularly in euros) have increased 
in price. These include many staple goods, so the impact has been keenly felt by 
ordinary Omanis.<br>
<br>
In response to soaring inflation, the government and CBO have introduced a raft 
of measures aimed at easing consumers’ pain and cooling prices. In February, a 
round of wage increases for government employees was announced, with pay packets 
rising by up to 43 per cent. At the same time, state pensions were boosted by 
between 5 per cent and 35 per cent. Subsidies on a range of goods were also 
increased – with wheat now subsidised to the tune of $64.95 a tonne (wheat 
futures for July hit $300.93 a tonne on the Chicago Board of Trade [CBOT]).<br>
<br>
On June 9, the CBO upped its side of the fight against inflation by tightening 
lending conditions. The bank increased the minimum reserve requirement (MRR) to 
8 per cent from 5 per cent and cut the maximum lending ratio (also known as the 
loan-to-valuation ratio [LVR]) from 87.5 per cent to 82.5 per cent. Meanwhile, 
it lowered the interest rate ceiling from 8.5 per cent to 8 per cent.<br>
<br>
The MRR obliges commercial banks to keep a certain proportion (in this case 8 
per cent) of their deposits in a non interest-bearing account with the central 
bank, meaning that it cannot be lent out. Therefore, theoretically at least, it 
tightens the narrow money supply by mopping up a degree of liquidity. The LVR 
limits the amount that a bank can contribute to a customer’s investment – i.e. 
Oman now requires the borrower to stump up at least 17.5 per cent of the 
required cash. Lowering the MVR should reduce the attraction of borrowing, again 
constraining credit growth. Finally, an interest ceiling caps the rate at which 
banks can lend out, in theory making lending less appealing. The CBO is 
deploying these policy tools to fight inflation. <br>
<br>
However, whether these moves will be enough to restrain price growth is 
questionable. Increasing the MRR is becoming a popular policy for countries 
experiencing inflation, particularly those with currency pegs. The requirement’s 
efficacy as a counter-inflationary device can be limited though. Foreign banks 
can circumvent the MRR by booking clients’ loans with their mother institutions 
or other overseas branches, therefore moving them off the local balance sheet. 
Meanwhile, local banks can suffer from the increased cost of lending.<br>
<br>
The LVR cut should be a more effective tool, but its impact may be somewhat 
mitigated by the CBO’s simultaneous decision to increase the limit on home 
mortgages as a proportion of banks’ loan portfolios from 5 per cent to 10 per 
cent. As the CBO stated, this move reflects a growing demand for housing 
finance, and further down the line could help stimulate the construction 
industry, increasing Oman’s currently tight residential property supply. In the 
short term though, easing housing loan regulation may run counter to a broader 
anti-inflationary strategy. What is clear though is that the CBO is doing its 
best to address inflation, and its moves should tighten lending a degree at the 
lower-value end of the retail market at least. Additionally, the positive side 
of the coin is that Oman’s banking system is robust and dynamic enough not to 
suffer unduly from the new limits.<br>
<br>
Like many emerging markets, Oman is facing sharply rising prices due in part to 
its own success and a degree of inflation is seen as an acceptable corollary of 
impressive growth, which the government is understandably reluctant to 
sacrifice. To a large extent, inflation has also been driven by external 
pressures, and so as these ease, the Sultanate should also see price growth 
moderate. With improved harvests in the MENA region, food prices are expected to 
stabilise. Worldwide, agricultural output may have been boosted in the medium 
term by higher prices and waning enthusiasm for biofuels. An increase in supply 
internationally should help moderate Oman’s imported food costs. The global 
economic slowdown may cool inflation somewhat by moderating demand, while not 
seriously hurting economies like Oman’s, which is growing quickly enough to 
cushion the impact of the West’s lacklustre performance. Furthermore, the Fed 
may now be looking to raise interest rates after US consumer price index (CPI) 
jumped 1.1 per cent – a 26-year record – in June. This would help tighten up the 
Sultanate’s monetary policy. <br>
<br>
Finally, with many new residential projects in the pipeline, Oman’s housing 
shortage should ease, cooling one of the major domestic inflationary pressures. 
While the government has moved to ensure that the inflationary spike does not 
hurt the less well-off disproportionately, the CBO has worked to tighten lending 
where it can, commendably, but possibly with limited effect. Over the next year, 
external pressures should ease, cooling major causes of imported inflation. 
Internally, bottle necks should begin to ease too, all of which should go a long 
way to returning Oman’s price growth to normal levels. <br>

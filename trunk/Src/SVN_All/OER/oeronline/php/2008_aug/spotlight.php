        Oman’s GDP grew by an impressive 13 per cent in 2007 with a significant 
        contribution from the non-oil sectors. The overall structural character 
        of the economy continued to be dominated by the oil and gas sector 
        during 2007, accounting for 45.3 per cent of GDP, 75.9 per cent of 
        merchandise exports and 75.8 per cent of net oil revenue in 2007. While 
        production of natural gas rose by 1.8 per cent in 2007, domestic demand 
        from upstream and downstream projects has also been rising consistently.<br>
        <br>
        The year 2007 was another year of impressive performance for the banking 
        sector, in terms of capital adequacy, assets and profits. “Capital 
        levels of commercial banks in relation to risk weighted assets remained 
        adequate at 15.9 per cent as at the end of 2007, which was considerably 
        higher than the regulatory minimum capital requirement of 10 per cent.<br>
        <br>
        The core capital and reserves of commercial banks increased by 62 per 
        cent over the year to RO1,458.2 million. Aggregate assets rose by 42.5 
        per cent RO10.3 billion, while gross Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) 
        recorded an absolute decline of RO33 million to about 320 million.<br>
        <br>
        Net profits of commercial banks, which had almost doubled over a period 
        of two years from RO79.4 million in 2004 to RO162.9 million in 2006, 
        grew further to RO213.7 million in 2007.<br>
        <br>
        CBO’s foreign reserves at the end of 2007 stood at RO3,662.1 million, 
        providing cover for 7.2 months of merchandise imports and 4.4 months of 
        all gross current account payments. The reserves further rose to 
        RO3,864.5 million at the end of June this year.<br>
        <br>
        According to Public Authority for Social Insurance (Pasi) data the 
        employment of Omanis in the private sector increased by 15.3 per cent 
        during 2007. In view of the high demand for labour during this robust 
        economic growth phase, there was an unprecedented increase in the number 
        of expatriate labour by 213,659 in the private sector over the two-year 
        period 2006-2007 to a total of 638,447 at the end of 2007 - which 
        increased further to 680,099 at the end of March 2008. Employment growth 
        for expatriates, thus, remained very high at 25 percent in 2007, over 
        and above a 20.2 per cent growth recorded in 2006.<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="spot1.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="300" height="200">Besides robust economic growth, the year was marked by generation of a 
        vast number of employment opportunities, notable progress in economic 
        diversification, sustained surpluses in the fiscal and balance of 
        payments positions, declining levels of public debt, comfortable levels 
        of foreign exchange reserves, and a sound and resilient banking system. 
        The high levels of growth was particularly remarkable because of its 
        “employment-intensity, which has also facilitated better distribution of 
        the benefits of growth in the economy. This augurs well for Non Banking 
        Finance Companies which offer a host of auto-loans and other personal 
        loans for consumers.<br>
        <br>
        The auto finance companies have made buying a car like a cake walk and 
        due to this it is easy to understand why everyone and anyone are seen 
        driving around in gleaming new cars even before they are officially 
        launched.<br>
        <br>
        The easy installment scheme, which is mostly spread over a period of 
        five years, has given car buyers the freedom to pick a car of their 
        choice without the least worry of the cost of the vehicle. For car 
        freaks and automobile lovers, one of the most eagerly awaited time in 
        the calendar is the month of Ramadan. It is during this period that 
        automobile dealers and finance companies dole out many offers, discounts 
        etc to facilitate your decision to buy a new car. <br>
        <br>
        Numerous newspaper advertisements scream out with tempting captions. 
        Perhaps the most attractive of all the details in a car advertisement 
        would be the part which talks of the numbers – the installment amount to 
        be precise. This magical number, talking about the monthly installment 
        scheme, is the gateway through which many wannabe car owners walk away 
        with the vehicle of their choice and dreams.<br>
        <br>
        And finance companies fall head over heels and also in the process, 
        trample upon each other, to compete for customers’ share. The best auto 
        financing company is usually the one offering the best deal.<br>
        <br>
        While attractive schemes also display the competitiveness within the 
        automobile industry, most often these are observed as the necessary 
        tools devised to help the local population to satisfy its basic need of 
        transportation.<br>
        <br>
        As far as the market is concerned, most of the dealers agree that the 
        prime car sales season is during Ramadhan, when some of them rake in 
        more money in a month than during the rest of the year. The best 
        schemes, offers and deals roll out of the woodwork then. Car companies 
        vie with each other to sell. A major din in the market emerges and auto 
        finance companies work overtime, checking and double-checking bank 
        statements and salaries of prospective customers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>A necessity</b><br>
        In fact, it is the country’s underdeveloped public transport system that 
        is responsible for making a large percentage of the population dependent 
        on personal vehicles rather than buying them for luxury. As a result, 
        the future of the automobile industry is now directly linked to the 
        increasing youth population, which is the prime target segment for most 
        of the dealers.<br>
        <br>
        Naturally, considering the overall dynamics of the economy, low-paying 
        entry level jobs plus the ever-present need, will force the dealers to 
        team up with auto finance companies to launch attractive installment 
        schemes and special offers.<br>
        <br>
        Most automobile dealers have an inevitable link with one auto-financing 
        company or the other. Not to be outdone, the banks are also in the fray 
        with their finance schemes.<br>
        <br>
        It is estimated that every year more than 30,000 cars are sold in Oman, 
        a large part of which are financed.<br>
        <br>
        Many consumers have also realized that it is better to go for an 
        automobile loan than block a huge some of money to purchase a car. The 
        surplus money can be kept for emergencies.<br>
        Since most of car dealers have tie-ups with finance companies, it is 
        possible to clinch a deal easily. Things have so simple that it is all a 
        matter of just filling in a few forms and hey presto, you could well be 
        on your way with your car. The only difficult part is providing personal 
        details like bank statements and any other loans that the client would 
        have availed from other financiers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>New and old markets</b><br>
        Essentially, there are two types of markets – replacement and new. The 
        replacement market consists of buyers who have already had cars but want 
        another one. New market represents the first time buyers. The 
        replacement market holds the bigger chunk, covering 80 per cent of the 
        market.<br>
        <br>
        The auto finance industry also has problems. The general problem is 
        non-payment – be it due to bouncing cheques, loss of job, unanticipated 
        payments, over commitment, sickness, etc. Circumstances such as sickness 
        can be resolved in the short term, but problems such as over commitment 
        have to be changed.<br>
        <br>
        The auto financing schemes are here to stay, as long as the Omani 
        population is growing. However, more interesting is the fact that the 
        Sultanate represents the most competitive market in the entire Gulf 
        region, where cars are extremely cheap. This means that dealers are 
        going to bombard the local market with all sorts of offers to lure the 
        customers.</font></p>

        <b>Challenges Ahead</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
        The automotive industry today is in the middle of a dramatic and largely 
        unprecedented transformation. The heart of this transformation is not 
        about how the auto company does its work but rather how it defines 
        itself.<br>
        <br>
        The global automotive industry today is delivering unprecedented levels 
        of customer value. Vehicles today are vastly superior to and more 
        reliable than those produced just a decade ago in terms of economy, 
        safety, comfort, functionality and performance. Fierce global 
        competition for consumers is the prime mover behind this increase in 
        customer value.<br>
        <br>
        But the automotive industry structure that has endured for eighty years 
        may be reaching the limit of its potential. Delivering the next 
        significant increment of value to automotive consumers while remaining 
        profitable will require dramatic increases in productivity across the 
        value chain.<br>
        <br>
        Increasing demands to cut costs to the bone and deliver one innovation 
        after another is putting enormous pressure on purchasing departments of 
        auto manufacturers. Original Equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have taken 
        the lead in mastering this complex balancing act. A close analysis of 
        their success stories has revealed key factors that may also help other 
        industries.<br>
        <br>
        A global study came up with six recommendations six recommendations for 
        purchasing departments in the automotive industry:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Source in low-cost countries – Manufacturers are increasingly realising 
        cost savings by purchasing in low-cost countries
        </font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Create a global supplier footprint – More and more carmakers are 
        defining a global supplier footprint strategy that provides the decision 
        framework for
        purchasing
        </font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Ensure access to technological innovations – Manufacturers are taking 
        considerable action to ensure continuous access to technological 
        innovations
        </font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Reduce costs together with suppliers – Manufacturers are accelerating 
        continuous cost reduction efforts together with cross-functions and 
        suppliers
        </font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Standardize – OEMs are increasingly focusing on technical levers to 
        reduce costs and improve the organizational prerequisites of Engineering
        </font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Globalise structures and decision making – Manufacturers are globally 
        aligning their organization and decision-making structures in Purchasing 
        and improving alignment to Engineering
        </font></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">In addition, key success factors have been identified. Companies that 
        are strategically well positioned are mindful of three factors that are 
        decisive when it comes to optimising purchasing, a strategic fit, 
        comprehensiveness and application.<br>
        <br>
        To ensure a strategic fit, business decisions in purchasing must 
        complement the strategy in other functional areas, follow the same aims 
        and be mutually supportive. The steps taken must also be comprehensive 
        enough to generate a substantial impact such as improving the cost 
        situation over the long term. Finally, the actions taken must be 
        stringently applied and constantly monitored to ensure success.<br>
        <br>
        Realising the need to adapt and offer consumers the best most NBFC’s in 
        the Sultanate have been trying to constantly improve their service and 
        offerings. Companies like Taageer Finance, National Finance and Al 
        Omaniya have been taking the lead in this direction.</font></p>

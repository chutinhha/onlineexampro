        <b>This entertaining story about two leaders tells how to apply right 
        techniques for results, writes Rajashekar Chandola</b><br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="book.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="175" height="164">In 1979 Ken Blanchard wrote his first book. ‘The Family Game: A 
        Situational Approach to Effective parenting’. He found his niche with 
        his second book ‘The One Minute Manager’ (TOMM) which came out in 1982 
        and went on to achieve cult status.<br>
        <br>
        Subsequently, he encashed its success with several books that used the 
        TOMM phrase in its title like Putting the One Minute Manager to Work, 
        Leadership and the One Minute Manager, The One Minute Manager Gets Fit, 
        The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey, The One Minute Manager Builds 
        High Performing Teams etc.<br>
        <br>
        Blanchard has written two dozen books, most of them best-sellers that 
        have been translated into several languages. He is today the Chairman of 
        the Board of Ken Blanchard Group of Companies, a worldwide training and 
        development firm. His books enjoy the blessings of brevity and what he 
        says is usually so commonsensical that no one can find fault with what 
        he says. The Leadership Pill follows the pattern.<br>
        <br>
        The Leadership Pill is entertaining story about the competition between 
        two leaders with totally different management styles, a story that 
        reveals the ingredients of ‘truly effective leadership’. The story is a 
        bouncy parable about a contest between a company that uses a 
        manufactured leadership pill to instill a pumped up results-only 
        approach and a company that uses value-driven leadership based on 
        integrity, partnership and affirmation.<br>
        <br>
        The story begins with the launch of a new pill that has the capability 
        to stimulate the natural powers of the mind and body to provide 
        leadership. A public challenge is posted with the selection of two 
        teams, one led by a leader taking the leadership pill, and the other led 
        by an Effective Leader who upholds that there can be no shortcuts to 
        successful leadership.<br>
        <br>
        The build up to the challenge is a bit overdone, and seems rather 
        grandiose. The ending proves that even though the pill is effective in 
        the short term and it does heighten the leader’s powers, but its 
        ingredients stimulate him in an obsessive and shortsighted direction 
        with disastrous results.<br>
        <br>
        The Effective Leader, working without a pill, shows that “only through 
        sustainability can our teams remain motivated and successful.” An 
        inspiring and supportive leader, he supplies the right ingredients, 
        earning his team’s respect and trust with a blend of integrity, 
        partnership, and affirmation. The hard-won result is a highly motivated 
        team producing consistent top performance and genuine success. 
        Ultimately it is recognised that “leadership for a lifetime” is much 
        easier to digest than a pill for leaders looking for a quick fix.<br>
        <br>
        The Leadership Pill shows business managers at any level how to apply 
        the right techniques for getting both results and the commitment of 
        their people, even when the pressure to perform is high.<br>
        <br>
        Highly recommended for those needing a quick refresher in leadership 
        skills. Warning, be prepared for a short book with large fonts and 
        several pages with only one sentence. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Communicate</b><br>
One of the most successful marketing techniques available today is a solid, 
informative, well-written newsletter – either hard copy or via e-mail. Indeed, 
over the years many organizations have turned around the success rate of their 
marketing campaigns with the launch of a regular and hard-hitting newsletter.
<br>
<br>
Every organisation needs a boost – whether it’s more leads, sales, increased 
profits or bigger customers, a well planned and executed newsletter can help you 
achieve the desired results. Today, successful businesses of every kind are 
built on solid customer relations and newsletters are the ultimate in 
relationship marketing. They enable you to connect with customers, prospects and 
stakeholders in a form that offers them the opportunity to engage with you. A 
newsletter establishes credibility as well as engendering a feeling of trust 
that, overtime, can be turned into loyalty and good custom. Why? Because the 
recipient of your newsletter actually wants to hear from you and if properly 
conceived and implemented will actually look forward to seeing what you have to 
say. Let’s face it, a newsletter is far less threatening than a telemarketing 
call and more likely to be read than a traditional direct mail shot. <br>
<br>
Now this all sounds very promising but newsletters aren’t an easy option and it 
can take a lot of time and effort to build a subscriber base – but for smart 
marketers the thought of capturing and connecting with a genuinely interested 
audience is irresistible. <br>
<br>
<b>What’s a Newsletter?</b><br>
I’ve seen a number of newly-launched Oman-based corporate newsletters – hard 
copy and e-mail versions – PEIE Mirror and PEIE Brief (both put out by the 
Public Establishment for Industrial Estates) are notable examples. But what’s 
the purpose of a corporate newsletter and how do you go about piecing one 
together? Newsletters come in all shapes and sizes and help to achieve many 
things. They keep staff, clients and stakeholders informed of projects and 
activities; they motivate staff; promote projects and services; celebrate 
success; share good practice; and offer 'added value' to clients and customers. 
In simple terms, a newsletter is a documentation and communication product that 
provides a regular update about an organisation or project. It can:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Solid Content</b><br>
The key to the success of your newsletter lies primarily in its content. Make no 
mistake – you aren’t the only organisation with a newsletter, these days there’s 
a great deal of competition out there. Recipients may well be happy to subscribe 
to more than one list but will only continue their subscription if you offer 
them something of value. <br>
<br>
So what makes good newsletter content? In my view, make it chatty and informal. 
But chatty doesn't mean airy. You need to say something worth saying. Remember, 
your job is to add value to your readers' lives, not frustrate or bore them. One 
thing newsletters aren’t about is selling. Build a newsletter around a sales 
pitch and it’ll die a very quick death. <br>
<br>
What type of content should you offer? A lot of this depends on your industry. 
What do your readers want/need to know? This certainly isn’t necessarily what 
your sales team wants to tell them. Put yourself in your readers’ shoes and 
think about what valuable information you could offer them. At least one 
in-depth feature article per issue is important, this can be supplemented by 
other content sources such as an interview with an industry expert, a case study 
or FAQ. How-to write articles are always popular. <br>
<br>
If you think about it, you're probably the local world's authority on something, 
at least your readers will think so if you explain the fine points to them in an 
article. If you run industrial estates, you'll talk about lean manufacturing, 
the impact of low wage economies on Oman’s manufacturing future, your tenants 
activities and products. You’ll look at the major trends affecting manufacturing 
and you’ll suggest training programs, websites, conferences and workshops that 
manufacturers will be interested in. I recommend that 80% of your content should 
be hard-hitting information delivered in a readable editorial style. Be 
inventive and interesting.<br>
<br>
Don't think you have to write all the articles yourself. If you don’t have the 
resources in-house to develop such content then hire an expert - paying for a 
good copywriter can pay excellent dividends. <br>
<br>
If you do have writing talent in-house then use it. Developing a personality for 
the newsletter is also a good way to make it stand out from the crowd. Think of 
your newsletter as a magazine or newspaper - give it distinct sections so people 
can build up a relationship with it and skim read it easily.<br>
<br>
<b>Launching Your Newsletter</b><br>
The first step to launching your newsletter, as with any marketing campaign, is 
to understand who your audience is. The best way to get results is to decide 
what objective you’re looking to fulfil and target your subscriber base 
accordingly. In many cases, the best place to start is with your current 
customer data base – they’re the folk that have shown an interest in your 
product or service and you’ve already established a level of knowledge and trust 
with them. There are a number of ways in which you might choose to build 
subscriptions to your newsletter - techniques include: </font></p>

</table>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Some of these methods will work better for you than others and most 
  organisations use a mix of different techniques until they hit upon the most 
  successful. It’s often well worth gathering subscriber details ahead of your 
  launch. For instance, a sign-up box on your website can be added six weeks in 
  advance, simply make it clear to recipients when they can expect to receive 
  the first edition.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Sample Newsletter</b><br>
Here are some tips on what a newsletter should look like:<br>
<br>
<b>Front Cover</b><br>
Name of the newsletter, date, edition number, logo. Introduction to your 
organisation. Lead article - outlining your experiences and position on the 
chosen theme; clear heading; photo; and fact box. In general terms, choose a 
theme for your lead article that’s topical, interesting for the readers and 
relevant to your organisation’s work. Don’t write articles that are too long. 
Focus on two or three key messages and use short paragraphs, photos and boxes to 
make the text attractive and easy to read. <br>
<br>
<b>Page 1 </b><br>
Four to six brief news updates about your organisation and its activities. Keep 
news and updates brief, topical and relevant to readers. <br>
<br>
<b>Page 2 </b><br>
Case study of a project/event, a member of your staff or a business partner 
showing what the chosen theme (e.g. lean manufacturing) means in practice – 
include the all-important photos. <br>
<br>
<b>Pages 4 - 6 </b><br>
Interview with a local stakeholder - sharing their views about lean 
manufacturing. Make sure the newsletter includes a wide variety of stakeholders, 
folk linked to your organisation. Indeed, let them contribute ideas and 
information to the newsletter. <br>
Keep your language simple and encourage those being interviewed to do the same. 
Definitely avoid abbreviations and jargon. <br>
<br>
<b>Page 7 </b><br>
Letters from readers, lists of resources such as training programmes, websites, 
books and magazines that you think would be of interest and value to your 
readers. It’s important that you keep a balance and not just run positive 
letters and feedback. <br>
<br>
<b>Page 8 </b><br>
Calendar of events and your contact details. Let people know how they can give 
feedback about the newsletter or get more copies.<br>
<br>
<b>Style </b><br>
What about the newsletter’s style and design – how you can make your newsletter 
as interesting and attractive as possible?<br>
<br>
Newsletters should be written in simple English using short sentences and 
written as you would speak. Compose articles with the most important information 
first and the least important last. The first few paragraphs should answer: <br>
• Who? <br>
• What? <br>
• Why? <br>
• Where? <br>
• When? <br>
• And how? <br>
<br>
Make sure the newsletter’s style complements your other corporate materials, 
such as brochures, website, pop-up banners, billboard ads, leaflets and annual 
reports.<br>
<br>
Your audience may be staff, clients, potential clients or stakeholders. If you 
produce an all-purpose newsletter it’s important to consider the needs and 
interests of all members of your audience. <br>
<br>
Think of a name for your newsletter that has a connection to your organisation. 
Make sure it’s easy to remember and isn’t being used by another group. It’s 
important that the newsletter is easy to use and has clear structure for its 
readers to follow. For example, number the pages and include a contents list.
<br>
<br>
Choose one person to edit the newsletter – this’ll guarantee that style is 
consistent throughout. <br>
<br>
Use visuals to liven up your newsletter. Make sure each one illustrates a 
specific point and has a caption explaining what it is. <br>
How often you choose to publish your newsletter will depend on its content and 
the audience, generally speaking once a month is about as frequent as most 
organisations can manage. Never over promise and under deliver. Remember, this 
is all about creating trust and fostering better customer relationships. If your 
content is good then not only will customers want to read what you have to say, 
they’ll look forward to receiving your newsletter. <br>
<br>

should be thinking about.</font></p>

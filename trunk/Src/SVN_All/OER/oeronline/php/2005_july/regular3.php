    <img border="1" src="toc1.jpg" width="150" height="108" align="left" hspace="5">Intel’s the word at Apple</b><br>
    After pushing Macintosh computers as superior alternatives for more than 20 
    years, Apple Computer Inc. recently said that it plans to switch to Intel 
    microprocessors that power machines designed to run Microsoft Windows.<br>
    <br>
    The move is expected to help Apple compete better against Windows PCs in 
    performance and price, though analysts believe the troubles from the 
    transition could further damage its slim 2.3 percent worldwide market share.<br>
    <br>
    Apple, which will continue to tightly couple its computers and its software, 
    now must convince users and potential buyers that today's Macs will not 
    become the technology equivalent of lame ducks. The company also has to get 
    programmers to develop software that works on both versions.<br>
    <br>
    In a speech to software developers, Apple CEO Steve Jobs admitted the change 
    will not be fast or easy. The first Intel-based Macs won't appear until 
    2006, and the full product line won't shift to Intel until the following 
    year, he said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is not going to be a transition that happens overnight,&quot; Jobs said. 
    &quot;It's going to happen over a period of a few years.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He said the move was driven by the fact that its current chip suppliers, IBM 
    Corp. and Freescale Semiconductor Inc., could not promise the same 
    horsepower and power efficiency as Intel.<br>
    <br>
    Programmers can immediately start developing software in a format that will 
    run natively on both existing and future Mac chips, he said. Apple also will 
    have a technology in place that will translate the code so that older 
    programs will run on the Macs with Intel inside.<br>
    <br>
    Jobs revealed that Apple has been working on the move for at least five 
    years, creating two versions of its Mac OS X operating system for both the 
    current Mac chips and those built by Intel.</font></td>

    <b>Yahoo! VOIP becomes a reality </b><br>
    Yahoo! has at last entered the consumer VOIP arena. The company confirmed a 
    deal to acquire VOIP provider Dialpad Communications Inc. for an undisclosed 
    amount. The move comes less than a month after Yahoo announced enhancements 
    to its Messenger IM application's VOIP functionality. With the addition of 
    Dialpad technology, Yahoo! users will be able to make calls from their PCs 
    that terminate on the PSTN anywhere in the world. <br>
    <br>
    The acquisition may even give Yahoo a leg up on Skype. “Since Yahoo! is 
    already SIP enabled, something Skype isn't, this also opens the door for 
    more robust features that could even include video,” writes VOIP analyst and 
    blogger Andy Abramson after Yahoo! confirmed the sale. <br>
    <br>
    Yahoo! will apparently use Dialpad technologies in other Yahoo! properties 
    as well. <br>
    <br>
    Less than a month ago, Yahoo! announced that using its Messenger IM product, 
    consumers can talk to friends and family anywhere in the world using a 
    PC-to-PC connection. With the addition of Dialpad technology, the person on 
    the other end will no longer need a PC; they can use a regular phone.</font></td>

    <b>Top ISPs at risk</b><br>
    According to Prolexic Technologies Internet ‘zombie’ attacks that attempt to 
    knock computer systems offline are more likely to come from users of America 
    Online than any other source.<br>
    <br>
    Prolexic Technologies, which helps companies fend off such attacks, sent a 
    press release that said AOL and other large Internet service providers serve 
    as launching pads for most ‘denial of service’ attacks. Other top sources of 
    such attacks include T-Mobile's, German-based service; Wanadoo, a French 
    Internet provider; and Comcast. <br>
    <br>
    Prolexic chief technology officer Barrett Lyon said the report could 
    indicate that some Internet providers don't protect their customers as much 
    as companies like EarthLink that don't show up on the list. &quot;Their clients 
    may be exposed differently or they may be doing a poor job of filtering 
    certain things from their clients,&quot; Lyon said, referring to AOL and the 
    other providers named in the report.<br>
    <br>
    But such figures only show that AOL has a much larger user base than other 
    Internet providers who account for nearly as many attacks, spokesman Andrew 
    Weinstein said.</font></td>

    Computer Associates, one of the world’s largest management software 
    companies, today launched its Channel Partner Programme in the Arab 
    countries. The programme is designed to cater to the needs of all CA 
    customers in the region with three partner levels — Affiliate, Premier and 
    Premier Enterprise Solutions Provider (ESP), matching the right partners to 
    the needs of different types of customers, from small and medium businesses 
    to large enterprise.<br>
    <br>
    “CA has developed its channel programmes, particularly its Premier ESP 
    programme, to meet the growing needs of regional businesses that demand 
    integrated IT management solutions,” said Michel de Martigny, vice president 
    of sales for CA in the Arab countries. “The driver behind the program is 
    CA’s commitment to ensuring customers receive world-class solutions and 
    support services.’’<br>
    <br>
    The entry-level Affiliate Partner programme is designed for resellers who 
    are serving SMBs while the top-end Premier ESP partners are CA’s core 
    value-added resellers primarily focused on enterprise customers in the 
    region. Premier ESP partners have to meet strict training and certification 
    requirements to ensure their services meet CA’s global quality standards and 
    customer needs.<br>
    <br>
    The Premier ESP Program offers unique benefits to partners including access 
    to CA’s comprehensive product portfolio, field sales support, bid support 
    from CA expert bid teams, discounts, rebate programs, 24X7 technical support 
    directly from CA, world-class training and certification, CA best practices 
    for implementation, access to qualified customer leads, reference on CA’s 
    website as a key partner, as well as business building marketing tools such

    World's largest chipmaker Intel Corporation recently hiked its revenue 
    forecast for the second quarter spurred by the strong sales of notebook 
    computers that use Intel Centrino chips. The company expects revenue of $9.1 
    billion to $9.3 billion for the quarter that ends July 2. <br>
    <br>
    Although Intel does not forecast its earnings, analysts said there could be 
    a profit of 28 cent per share for the quarter. The company, however, said 
    gross margins would probably be 57 per cent, rather than 56 per cent, 
    forecast in April.<br>

    The wait is over. Six years after announcing the concept, IBM has officially 
    launched their newest supercomputer, ‘The Watson Blue Gene System’ (BGW) 
    which can process data at an estimated 91.29 teraflops.<br>
    <br>
    The system will join its sister machine, the Blue Gene/L supercomputer, 
    currently installed at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL). The Blue 
    Gene/L is currently the world's fastest private supercomputer. The BGW 
    System is comprised of 20 refrigerator-sized racks, less than 1/2 the size 
    of conventional systems of comparable power and operates at 3 times the 
    performance.<br>
    <br>
    Tilak Agerwala, Vice President of Systems, said, “IBM researchers will use 
    BGW to accelerate discovery in a variety of disciplines. Researchers, 
    scientists, engineers and inventors can now ask more questions, test more 
    theories, try more designs, and simulate more conditions than has been 
    possible before.”<br>
    <br>
    IBM will use the system to explore life sciences, hydrodynamics, materials 
    sciences, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics and fluid dynamics, as well 
    as business applications.</font></td>

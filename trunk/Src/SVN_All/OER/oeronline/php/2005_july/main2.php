    the impetus on travel is shifting from holiday and leisure to business 
    purposes. No wonder, to grab a pie of the travel business, every country is 
    hard selling itself as the ultimate destination for MICE (meetings, 
    incentives, conferences and exhibitions). Looking beyond USA, Spain, France 
    and England which are widely regarded as the leading MICE destinations, OER 
    takes a look at the fast emerging top 5 MICE destinations where you can move 
    away from the heat of Oman and still carry on with the business.<br>

    As a congress and meetings destination, Germany has already staked its claim 
    to the number one MICE destination rank in Europe as per the International 
    Association Meetings Market 2004 study by the International Congress &amp; 
    Convention Association (ICCA). The country boasts of excellent 
    infrastructure in terms of leading hotels, convention centres and 
    destinations, car hire firms, event agencies and service providers. If you 
    wish to choose Germany as your MICE destination, you can get imaginative and 
    enjoyable solutions to incentive travel and events. It is a land blessed not 
    only with a prodigious pool of energetic partners and superb facilities but 
    also with fascinating and wonderful landscapes. <br>

    Despite its size, Singapore with its excellent infrastructure and vibrant 
    ambience is becoming a favourite MICE destination in Asia. Whatever the size 
    of your meeting, Singapore has a fully equipped venue for you. The 
    exhibition and convention venues for 50 to 12,000 persons are available all 
    over the city. One such venue built for this purpose is the SUNTEC 
    Singapore. Other venues include the Raffles City Convention Centre and 
    meeting rooms in most of the hotels. You won’t be stuck in traffic jams or 
    face any other commuting problem. Thanks to the world's first electronic 
    road pricing system, Singapore has managed to keep its key roads and 
    expressways free flowing.<br>

    Dubai is the hottest MICE destination in the world now. Dubai hosting the 
    annual meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and the 
    International Monetary Fund is a testimony that Dubai has arrived on the 
    global MICE circle. The new Dubai International Convention Centre (DICC) has 
    elevated Dubai to the top level. In future, Dubai’s hospitality industry is 
    going to zoom up with atleast 200 luxury hotels and resorts expected to come 
    up in the next five years. <br>

    With the focus on integrating their economy with the global market, China 
    has begun aggressively promoting itself as a major MICE destination. With 
    multinational companies rushing to grab a pie in the Chinese market, the 
    country is hosting increased number of business meetings, exhibitions and 
    conventions. A large number of professional convention organisers are 
    engaging in integrated services of offering information about destinations, 
    itinerary arrangements and planning and organising of business events. China 
    has an excellent infrastructure including modern airports, expressways, 
    railways, telecommunications, banks and hotels. With its vast size and 
    diverse offering, China appeals to a large number of business travellers.

    Holland is emerging out of the shadows of its better-known neighbouring MICE 
    countries. English is spoken everywhere now. Holland is the gateway to 
    Europe and centrally located within Europe. It is compact and easy to get 
    around. <br>
    <br>
    It boasts of a good public transport system; advanced telecommunications 
    infrastructure; rail links to all major European cities; frequent flights to 
    all parts of the world from Schiphol which is Europe’s fourth largest 
    airport; excellent connectivity through Rotterdam, world’s largest seaport 
    and a major distribution centre for European hinterland.</font></td>

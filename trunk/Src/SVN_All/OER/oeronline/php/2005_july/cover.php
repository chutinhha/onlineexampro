            today without collecting personal information such as names,

            employees, business partners, students, patients or any ordinary 
            citizen. If this information falls into wrong hands, it could put 
            these individuals at risk of identity theft. <br>
            <br>
            When technology is used to collect, store and communicate

            2004 alone. Trends indicate a high rate of increase in identity 
            theft complaints as shown in the graph.<br>
            <br>
            As the saying goes ‘On the Internet who knows you really are’! Most 
            often, login names, passwords and PIN (Personal Identification 
            Number) authorise transactions without any physical identification. 
            This becomes easy for identity thieves aiming to capture your 
            personal and financial data that could later be misappropriated. In 
            the dark cynical view of the modern world, by Steven Spielberg in 
            his Minority Report, Tom Cruise gets identified by metallic-spiders 
            and advertisement-billboard retina scanners and had to undergo 
            retina replacement surgery to avoid detection. Biometric identity is 
            not in its infant state these days. However, identity theft costs 
            many a victim much time and effort to recover but the adverse effect 
            can even be life changing. <br>
            <br>
            Not all information may reveal an individual’s identity. But the 
            name, address, phone number and perhaps national or passport ID 
            number certainly does. Electronically held or communicated personal 
            information can be used to track you down in the real world and such 
            data when compromised can create a high element of identity risk. 
            The issue was portrayed to dramatic proportions in the Hollywood 
            movie Face Off. Criminal minded John Travolta steals police 
            detective Nicholas Cage’s identity (even implants a sound chip to 
            mimic his voice) rendering Nicholas Cage unrecognisable even by his 
            family and hence run the risk of death by law enforcement. Simply 
            put, what if the bad guy steals the identity of the good guy and 
            goes scot-free after committing a crime?<br>
            <br>
            Research by Harris Interactive and Gartner revealed that in 2003, 
            approximately 7 million people were victims of identity theft, which 
            is equivalent to a little more than 13 identity thefts every minute. 
            Yet another study on the aftermath of an identity theft by the 
            Identity Theft Resource Centre (<span style="text-decoration: none"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.idtheftcenter.org"><font color="#004600"><span style="text-decoration: none">http://www.idtheftcenter.org</span></font></a></span>) 
            found that victims spend 600 hours recovering from the crime because 
            they must contact and work with credit cards, banks, credit bureaus, 
            and law enforcement. This time can add up to as much as $16,000 in 
            lost wages or income.<br>
            <br>
            Consider the case of Venkatesh Pabbaraju, a resident of Atlanta, US. 
            As any normal citizen, he was quite comfortable shopping online and 
            requesting for his beloved articles online, paying with his credit 
            cards. However, in 2004, his credit card number and other relevant 
            details were compromised and someone imposing his identity had 
            swiped one of his credit cards to the tune of $7,000 (RO2,692). 
            Again, in the beginning of 2005, Venkatesh was informed that hackers 
            had attacked ChoicePoint, and there existed a possibility that his 
            identity could have been stolen.<br>
            <br>
            ChoicePoint acts as a business intermediary for keeping financial 
            details of people for access by other relevant businesses. This is 
            yet another shock to customers who are completely frustrated about 
            the due negligence on the part of ChoicePoint in securing its IT 
            systems from vulnerable attacks. Identity theft victims like 
            Venkatesh solicit mitigating actions. Unauthorised access to 140,000 
            consumer records from ChoicePoint’s database, and lost credit card 
            information on 1.2 million Bank of America customers, have spurred 
            US government regulators into action.<br>
            <br>
            According to Federal Trade Commission reports in the end of 2004, 
            complaints about identity theft have gone up from 1380 in 1999 to 
            about 246,570 in 2004. Such theft, when quantified in monetary 
            terms, could indicate a loss of about $47.6 billion (RO18.31 
            billion). More recently, in the third week of April, Polo Ralph 
            Lauren Corp. notified thousands of consumers through banks and 
            credit card issuers that their credit-card information might have 
            been exposed. When they claim that information of some of its 
            customers may have been retained and stored on its point-of-sale 
            software, one can think deeply if he/she ever used cautious 
            discretion before swiping cards at super markets or restaurants. 
            Following such incidents, US Congress is primed to pass new laws to 
            try to prevent break-ins and to require businesses to confess to 
            customers when private data is gathered.</font></p>

                <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Phishing origin</b><br>
                The word ‘phishing’ comes from the analogy that Internet 
                scammers are using email lures to ‘fish’ for passwords and 
                financial data from the sea of Internet users. It is pronounced 
                as ‘fishing’. It is an act of sending an email to a user falsely 
                claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an 
                attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information 
                that will be used for identity theft. The email directs the user 
                to visit a Website where they are asked to update personal 
                information, such as passwords and credit card, social security, 
                and bank account numbers, that the legitimate organisation 
                already has. The Website, however, is bogus and set up only to 
                steal the user's information.<br>
                <br>
                The term was coined some time in the year 1996 by hackers who 
                were stealing America On-Line (AOL) accounts by scamming 
                passwords from unsuspecting AOL users. The first mention on the 
                Internet of phishing is on the alt.2600 hacker newsgroup in 
                January 1996, however the term may have been used even earlier 
                in the printed edition of the hacker newsletter ‘2600’.<br>
                <br>
                ‘Ph’ is a common hacker replacement for ‘f’, and is a nod to the 
                original form of hacking, known as ‘phreaking’. Phreaking was 
                coined by the first hacker, John Draper (aka. ‘Captain Crunch’). 
                John invented ‘hacking’ by creating the infamous Blue Box, a 
                device that he used to hack telephone systems in the early 
                1970s.<br>
                <br>
                This first form of hacking was known as ‘Phone Phreaking’. The 
                Blue Box emitted tones that allowed a user to control the phone 
                switches, thereby making long distance calls for free, or 
                billing calls to someone else's phone number etc. This is in 
                fact the origin of a lot of the ‘ph’ spelling in many hacker 
                pseudonyms and hacker organisations.<br>
                <br>
                By 1996, hacked accounts were called ‘phish’, and by 1997, phish 
                were actually being traded between hackers as a form of 
                currency. People would routinely trade 10 working AOL phish for 
                a piece of hacking software that they needed.<br>
                <br>
                Over the years, phishing attacks grew from simply stealing AOL 
                dial-up accounts into a more sinister criminal enterprise. 
                Phishing attacks now target users of online banking, payment 
                services such as PayPal, and online e-commerce sites. Phishing 
                attacks are growing quickly in number and sophistication. In 
                fact, since August 2003, most major banks in the USA, the UK and 
                Australia have been hit with phishing attacks.</font></td>

            contract? Again, every email finalising a business deal is also a 
            form of contract. A contract is a legally binding agreement between 
            two or more people or organisations identified as parties to the 
            transaction. In other words, it is simply an offer or proposal 
            reciprocated with an acceptance or revocation.<br>

            <br>

            Speaking at a newspaper convention, American President George W.

            daughters Jenna and Barbara for fear that his ‘‘personal stuff’’ 
            might be intercepted and misused. It only shows the level of trust

            <b>Be Aware</b><br>
            Identity theft is an issue of consumer and business awareness. Most 
            often, when you are residing in Oman, enter details on a form (say 
            application, registration, request for service, order products, 
            etc.) the information becomes part of a database that’s used by 
            businesses later. But the late 90s has seen a new set of criminals 
            stealing identities using electronic means that seems a lot easier 
            to do.<br>
            <br>
            Your everyday transactions, which usually reveal bits of your 
            personal information: your bank and credit card account numbers, 
            your income, your National ID/Labour Card number or your name, 
            address, and phone numbers. An identity thief obtains some piece of 
            your sensitive information—say personal or financial—and can use it 
            without your knowledge to commit fraud or theft.<br>
            <br>
            Identity theft is a serious crime. People whose identities have been 
            stolen can spend months or years and their hard earned money in 
            cleaning up the mess the thieves have made of their good name and 
            credit record. Some victims have to pay a very heavy penalty as they 
            lose job opportunities, get refused loans for education, housing or 
            cars, or even get arrested for crimes they didn’t commit.</font></p>

                </b>Pharming is the most recent Internet scam. It could turn out 
                to be more threatening as even experienced Internet users can 
                fall prey to it and may not know that they have been hit by an 
                Internet scam.<br>
                <br>
                Pharming, a play on ‘phishing’, involves highly skilled hackers 
                who secretly redirect user’s computer from financial sites to 
                the scammer’s fake ones, where they steal passwords and other 
                personal information. Even the Web address looks the same. The 
                process involves intercepting a user on his or her way to the 
                bank or credit card company. It can affect a large number of 
                Internet users at a time unlike phishing where a single user is 
                affected at a time. So far the hackers have been aiming at small 
                segment of the Internet and re-routing traffic to fake bank 
                sites to capture user passwords. The original legitimate sites 
                don't notice the drop in Web traffic, as pharming is restricted

                The scam is a recent phenomenon and Internet security gurus have 
                just begun warning Internet users about it. Pharmers follow two 
                different strategies – Attacking either user’s computer or the 
                large servers that find Websites for users. <br>
                <br>
                The first technique is to send virus-laden emails that secretly 
                install a software programme on the user’s computer. Whenever 
                the user makes an attempt to go to his bank's Website, he is 
                redirected by the browser to the pharmer’s fake site. The user 
                is then requested to update his information like login ids, 
                passwords or personal details like driving license number etc. 
                Even innocent users’ keystrokes are captured in order to steal 
                identities.<br>
                <br>
                The second way is to exploit the fact that Websites have verbal 
                names but reside at numeric addresses on the Internet. When 
                user’s type a Website's name into their browsers, Domain Name 
                System or DNS, servers read the name, look up its numeric 
                address and take users to the site. The pharmers meddles in by 
                changing the real site's numeric address to the fake site's 
                numeric address.<br>
                <br>
                This process called DNS poisoning is not a new phenomenon but 
                adopted recently by cyber criminals for stealing identities and 
                termed it as pharming.</font></td>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Opportunities 
            for ID Theft</b><br>
            Identity criminals have devised many scrupulous schemes to gain 
            access to people’s personal information. They get information from 
            businesses by stealing records from their employer or bribing an 
            employee who has access to these records or by hacking into the 
            company’s network and computers. Alternatively they search through 
            businesses’ trash (dumpster diving) . <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes, it is possible to obtain credit reports by impersonating 
            as one who may have a right to the information. It is even to steal 
            credit and debit card numbers while using it on legitimate 
            operations (skimming). Stolen mail with bank and credit card 
            statements and cheques reveal vital information occasionally. Such 
            mails could even be completely diverted to another location by 
            change-of-address facility. Information can simply be stolen from 
            your home or you can even be conned by someone posing as a 
            legitimate businessperson or government official. Identity theft 
            online can happen due to security threats such as ‘hacking’, 
            ‘spamming’, ‘spyware’, ‘phishing’ or even ‘pharming’.<br>
            <b><br>
            Consequences of ID Theft</b><br>
            Once identity thieves have your personal information, they may 
            misuse this in different ways. Normally, credit or debit cards when 
            stolen result in immediate heavy shopping bills being swiped through 
            or ATM misuses (most often, PIN number scribbled in the card’s 
            encasing envelope are responsible for this). Personal details, 
            including name, date of birth and ID or passport number may be 
            sufficient to open credit card accounts. Most financial institutions 
            offer mail change facilities to their cardholders. This facility can 
            be misused to divert account statements. In this type of fraud, the 
            owner may take some time to know there is a persistent problem of 
            unsettled credit card bills.<br>
            <br>
            Loans such as automobile loans and phone or Internet connections can 
            be availed based on basic identity details along with passport 
            photographs. It may even be possible for fraudsters to open a bank 
            account in a stolen name and write bad cheques on that account. If 
            it is alarming to even think of such possibilities, consider the 
            cases of naïve victims suffering with lost identities that have been 
            misused.</font></p>

                confidential data? <br>
                </b>Recently, the London based Sun newspaper came up with a 
                screaming headline that an Indian call centre worker had sold 
                the bank account details of 1,000 British customers to the 
                newspaper’s undercover reporter. Immediately, the rest of the 
                world press picked up the story and raised the issue of the 
                growing menace of identity thefts. The London Police also swung 
                into action initiating a series of investigations in different 
                locations after receiving the document which mentioned the 
                details of the banks whose security may have been compromised.<br>
                <br>
                The undercover reporter allegedly claimed that information on 
                1,000 accounts, passports and credit cards for £4.25 each was 
                sold to him. The reporter stated that the information was 
                provided by an employee of the call center based in Delhi. The 
                newspaper report has created fear in the minds of the customers 
                of the affected banks as this breach could lead to access to the 
                financial details of innocent victims, prowling of their 
                accounts and the cloning of credit cards by expert criminals.<br>
                <br>
                The Sun further claimed that the corrupt call centre worker 
                promised to provide 200,000 account details a month for the 
                parties interested in buying the data. Though not confirmed but 
                NatWest and Barclays are among the victim banks. Barclays 
                quickly refuted the claim by stating that the bank’s customers 
                need not worry, as no personal customer data was stored in 
                India.<br>
                <br>
                The scandal has led to the issue that British banks outsourcing 
                services from India must seek guarantees from the Indian 
                government that the full measure of the law will be used against 
                the offenders.</font></td>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Data Brokers</b><br>
            Only after the recent security breaches leading to the compromise of 
            the privacy of thousands of naïve public, and the resulting media 
            publicity most people are aware of the so called ‘data aggregators’ 
            or ‘data brokers’ or ‘information brokers’. These companies compile 
            in-depth information about almost everyone, even though many have 
            never heard of them, have never had an account with them, nor have 
            given them permission to obtain personal information .<br>
            <br>
            Such firms collect and store information about the common public 
            from different sources including public records (registration 
            systems, court records, property tax assessment files, medical 
            examination reports, professional practice licenses, vehicle 
            registration, etc), along with credit reports and demographic data. 
            Consequently, they sell this information to their customers who may 
            be employers, loan collectors, media organisations, law offices, 
            enforcement officials, landlord or insurer. <br>
            <br>
            Unaware of this access, the customer may apply for a loan or 
            insurance claim. To their dismay, they may be turned down based on 
            the individual’s enigmatic background check. The situation gets 
            worse if the criminals having access to sensitive data find it easy 
            to impersonate innocent people for their criminal activities. The 
            naïve apart from losing their credit also lose their identity. When 
            law enforcement acts upon this criminal data, the poor victim has no 
            defence having lost his identity.<br>
            <br>
            ChoicePoint is one of the largest data aggregators in the US, 
            holding about 19 billion files of public information. Some of this 
            belongs to employees of the government, defence personnel and even 
            senators. The identity thieves who obtained ChoicePoint accounts 
            through the establishment of fake business identities could then 
            have online access to ChoicePoint’s data files; to obtain all the 
            personal information they needed – including Social Security numbers 
            and date of birth – to successfully commit identity theft. <br>
            <br>
            Yet another leading data broker, the Reed Elsevier Group’s 
            LexisNexis unit, announced in April this year that personal 
            information on 310,000 US citizens may have been stolen. It seemed 
            that its databases had been fraudulently breached 59 times using 
            stolen passwords, leading to the possible theft of personal 
            information such as addresses and Social Security numbers. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Security Negligence</b><br>
            There has been a rapid erosion of privacy rights due to faulty data 
            security that certainly calls for timely actions. In March this 
            year, on a Business Week forum, a hacker named ‘brookbond’ 
            penetrated an Admission System and posted instructions on the 
            Internet for applicants to know their application status before 
            being formally notified by the respective colleges. <br>
            <br>
            About 400 colleges and universities use this admissions management 
            system, hosted and managed by ‘ApplyYourself’ of Virginia. Harvard, 
            MIT's Sloan School of Management and business schools at Dartmouth 
            College, Duke University and Stanford University were among those 
            universities that were affected.<br>
            <br>
            When the Bank of America lost computer tapes containing credit card 
            records of US senators and more than a million US government 
            employees, they simply put the customers at increased risk of 
            identity theft. Social Security numbers, addresses and account 
            numbers were on the tapes for 1.2 million account holders (about 
            900,000 of which belonged to US Department of Defence employees). 
            Bank of America routinely ships backup data tapes for storage at 
            different locations in case any of their office is damaged by fire 
            or flood. This only exposes that the vulnerability attacks are at 
            the weakest security link in an IT-based system. Lack of diligence 
            in handling data results in victimisation of innocent consumers. It 
            warrants certain responsible action by the company involved.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Art of Balance</b><br>
            Lawmakers are now concerned about criminals gaining access to 
            thousands of consumer profiles in a database maintained by data 
            profiling companies. Until contemporary initiatives taken by the 
            legal forum of California and Texas, there were no legal bindings on 
            their business practices of data aggregation companies. 
            Nevertheless, most countries are currently looking into prohibiting 
            sale of national and social identity data for commercial purposes. 
            Any such law should stipulate that consumer information, including 
            credit reports, cannot be released to a third party without the 
            express permission of the consumer, a provision called ‘opt-in’. New 
            laws are needed to help data theft victims recover more rapidly. For 
            example, individuals must be able to change their National ID 
            numbers, if their numbers have been stolen and used to perpetrate 
            fraud.<br>
            <br>
            Considering the vital services provided by such information brokers 
            to the industry in general, it is not appropriate to cripple them 
            with strong regulations. However, they need to bear more liability 
            when security breaches occur and protect the consumers. The effort 
            to inform consumers about security breaches that they have 
            experienced and thus might expose consumer data is mandatory. 
            Encryption of data where possible, must be performed more diligently 
            on entities that can access the data and stringent access controls 
            should be enforced.<br>
            <br>
            According to California’s privacy notification law, citizens can now 
            exercise a ‘security freeze’ on their credit file in order to 
            prevent identity theft. It means that your file cannot be shared 
            with potential creditors without your explicit consent. When 
            businesses need to open credit accounts, they shall consult the 
            credit history. In such a case, the credit freeze will disable any 
            impostor producing your credentials and thus using your identity .
            <br>
            <br>
            It is now in effect a matter of striking the right balance between 
            nourishing online trades and controlling the trade practices. The 
            information brokers play an important role in the business practices 
            by maintaining up-to-date status of financial information about 
            their clients. Such information when authorised by the client can be 
            accessed by banks for processing loans, or verified by landlords for 
            effecting rental contracts. Insurance companies may also vie to 
            access this information prior to offering policies and claims. But 
            they must be enabled access to the data only upon due permission 
            from their clients to view such credit history.</font></p>

            Security scams such as phishing and pharming deceive earnest 
            customers to reveal their personal and financial information 
            cleverly. Phishing is an online Website identity theft. This sort of 
            Identity theft scam that ‘fishes’ for personal information start 
            with emails posing as legitimate emails from FBI, Ebay, PayPal, 
            Citibank, Visa or even our local banks. Phishing fraudsters use spam 
            (unsolicited emails) to direct Internet users to Websites that look 
            like legitimate e-commerce sites but are in fact, controlled by 
            crooks.<br>
            <br>
            A new scheme of so-called ‘pharming’ attacks is targeting the .com 
            Internet domain, redirecting some Internet users who are looking for 
            .com Websites to Webpages controlled by anonymous attackers. 
            Pharming attacks (typically through DNS hijacking or cache 
            poisoning) are similar to phishing identity theft attacks, but don't 
            require a ‘Web-link decoy’ that must be clicked by visitors to be 
            taken to the spurious Website. Most famous brand sites are favourite 
            targets as noted from the highlights from APWG- Anti-Phishing 
            Working Group.<br>
            <br>
            Spams are only a means to an end for the cyber criminals in their 
            mission. Users are asked to provide sensitive information such as 
            passwords, bank account information or credit card numbers, often 
            under the guise of updating an account. According to the APWG 
            reports, 13,141 unique phishing attacks were reported in April 2005 
            and this was a 180 per cent increase over the number of attacks 
            reported in March 2004, representing a monthly growth rate of over 
            75 per cent per month since December.<br>
            <br>
            If you have an e-mail account, you must have most certainly received 
            spam – unsolicited emails. In Internet terms, SPAM stands for ‘Self 
            Promotional Advertising Message’ while it also indicates ‘SPiced 
            hAM’ and unsolicited tinned food served by default. As per Gartner’s 
            research, when each day an employee spends an average of 49 minutes 
            in managing his mails, the negative impact of spam on workplace 
            productivity is significant. Since 1992, the spam mails scanned by 
            MessageLabs, the global leader in email security services, has risen 
            to 72 per cent in 2004. <br>
            <br>
            Around 14.5 billion spam messages are being sent around the world 
            each day. The cost to US organisations for fighting spam is 
            estimated at $17 billion (RO6.54 billion) in 2005. For some people, 
            receiving spam just means having to delete unwanted messages, 
            occasionally others suffer when their email-accounts are potentially 
            unusable. Internet service providers provide e-mail-filtering 
            services, which may be set to quarantine spam. Spam filters use a 
            statistical analysis of keywords within an email. Bayesian filters 
            calculate the probability of a message being spam. <br>
            <br>
            The problem is that identifying spam is not easy. SPAM filters 
            installed in the servers require consumer support fine-tuning that 
            can identify subsequent spam mails. Aggressive filtering rules mean 
            blocking 99.9 per cent of spam, but it would also block legitimate 
            mails.<br>
            <br>
            IBM, the industry leader, has very recently released FairUCE (Fair 
            Use of Unsolicited Commercial Email) product that uses identity 
            management features to link inbound e-mail back to its original IP 
            address by establishing a connection between an e-mail message, the 
            Internet domain and the computer from which the e-mail was sent. 
            FairUCE software runs on e-mail servers. It pulls IP addresses out 
            of e-mail messages and then compares those against one or more 
            databases of known spammers.<br>
            <br>
            Companies are motivated to invest in comprehensive Intruder 
            Detections and Prevention (ID/IP) security tools in an attempt to 
            strengthen consumer confidence in online transactions. Enterprises 
            must take several integrated security and awareness measures to 
            counter phishing and other cyber crime attacks.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Business Cautions</b><br>
            Most businesses looking to harness technology into core business 
            processes must be proactively responsive of the need for data 
            security. Lack of security is only marginally better than no 
            security. In case of security breaches, inform competent legal 
            authorities. Also inform your potential business partners and 
            clients of the potential risk of identity theft. Take all measures 
            to stop further access to sensitive data and seal loopholes in your 
            business security systems. Alter all admin passwords.<br>
            <br>
            When the compromise could result in harm to a person or business, 
            call your local police department immediately. Report your situation 
            and the potential risk for identity theft. The sooner law 
            enforcement learns about the theft, the more effective they can be. 
            Assign a contact person within your organisation for releasing 
            information. Give the contact person the latest information about 
            the breach, your response, and how individuals should respond.<br>
            <br>
            In case of breach of security and resulting leak of personal data 
            through your Website, immediately withdraw your site. Make it a 
            point of action to inform search engines and ISPs (Internet Service 
            Providers) to delete any such personal data from their server-cache 
            memories. </font></p>

                </b>Early this year, it was reported that Bank of America Corp.

                of up to 1.2 million federal employees using ‘smart pay’ charge 
                cards, including some members of the US Senate. The information

                criminals. <br>
                <br>
                It was alleged that the data backup tapes were stolen off a 
                commercial plane by baggage handlers. Regretting the incident, 
                the bank issued apology letters to the affected customers. To 
                make matters worse, the bank refused to comment on the format of 
                the data on the stolen tapes and wouldn't say if the data was

            In case of stolen wallets or identity cards, inform the bank

            If your cheques have been stolen or misused, close the concerned

            cooperation in taking reasonable care of your account. The liability 
            of loss may fall upon the consumer if in case he fails to inform the 
            bank in a timely manner of the loss or theft. Contact your banking 
            or other financial institutions for further details. Before 
            revealing any identifying information (for example, on an 
            application), ask how it will be used and secured, and whether it 
            will be shared with others. If possible, choose to keep it 
            confidential.<br>
            <br>
            Limit the identification information and the number of credit and 
            debit cards that you carry to what you’ll actually need. Avoid using 
            an automatic login feature that saves your username and password 
            while protecting financial information on laptops. Delete any 
            personal information stored on your computer before you dispose of 
            it. Use a ‘disk wipe’ utility program, which overwrites the entire 
            hard drive and makes the files unrecoverable.<br>

            Transact only with those Websites that have secure privacy policies 
            answering questions about the access to and accuracy, security, and 
            control of personal information the site collects, as well as how 
            sensitive information will be used, and whether it will be provided 
            to third parties.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Final Word</b><br>
            The law enforcement officials across the nation need to help 
            customers and businesses to stop identity thieves by providing easy 
            access channels of communication, information dissemination and 
            resolution. Some such simple mechanisms are toll-free telephone 
            lines, customer call centres for technical clarifications, Web-based 
            complaint submission facility, SMS for immediate attention towards 
            malicious websites and loss of identity.<br>
            <br>
            Competition and brand image is pushing companies to adopt new IT 
            security tools in a bid to strengthen consumer confidence in their 
            online transactions. Financial institutions enabling user 
            interaction through electronic means, say tele-banking, online 
            payments and Web-based enquiries are more compelled for investment 
            in security and it is indeed a matter of survival through testing 
            technical counter- measures.<br>
            <br>
            Consider the initiative of ETrade Financial Corporation when it 
            announced that it is offering high-value customers a token-based 
            form of authentication technology that can be used with passwords to 
            provide an additional layer of protection for accessing online 
            accounts. Other potential measures such as biometric authentication 
            using fingerprint templates stored in Oman’s national identity cards 
            may enhance physical identity verification beyond factual data.<br>
            <br>
            According to research by information security company Vontu, 95 per 
            cent of data security risk comes from faulty business processes and 
            untrained users. Creation of awareness about security 
            vulnerabilities is a resilient preventive measure. Omani banks are 
            truly concerned about their customers and as a reflection of their 
            concerns, issue alert notices time and again. <br>
            <br>
            Awareness initiatives, for instance those taken by the Central Bank 
            of Oman in cautioning the public against increasing attempts of 
            fraud and BankMuscat issuing an advertisement regarding SPAM mails 
            are certainly praiseworthy. Adoption of the National ID card 
            information into mainstream activities surrounding the life of a 
            citizen will enable physical verification of identity. <br>
            <br>
            ID theft cannot be completely eliminated or completely controlled 
            like any other crime. But, according to the US - Federal Trade 
            Commission, one can minimise risk by managing personal information 
            cautiously and with heightened sensitivity considering the abuse of 
            their vulnerability. <br>

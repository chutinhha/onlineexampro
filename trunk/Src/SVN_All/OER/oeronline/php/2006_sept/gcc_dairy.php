upswing in the Telecom liberalisation drive has boosted mobile phone penetration 
levels in the Gulf countries. While Bahrain and the UAE, cite the Madar Research 
Study, have achieved population coverage growth figures comparable to those 
prevalent in Europe and Pacific Rim countries, the overall mobile subscription 
growth for GCC in 2005 is about 38 per cent.<br>
<br>
This sudden spurt derives from deregulation and technology expansion. All the 
GCC countries except Qatar have ended their monopoly in the telecom sector. Now 
there is more than one telecom player in the market in each country. In a 
significant move, the GCC has linked up with an inter-regional fibre optic 
network known as FARAJ (also known as FOG). This network is now connected to the 
FLAG cable system, a global fibre optic link owned and operated by FLAG Limited.
<br>
<br>
<b>Penetration Levels</b><br>
On an average, the penetration rate in the GCC is 92 per cent — with Oman and 
Saudi Arabia being the least penetrated, and Bahrain and UAE being the most 
penetrated among the Gulf countries. Bahrain tops the list with the highest 
levels of penetration at 105.8 per cent in cellular phones, followed by UAE (99 
per cent), Qatar (90 per cent), Kuwait (82 per cent), Saudi Arabia (58 per cent) 
and Oman (55 per cent) mobile penetration. (Data as of Q4-2005 according to 
Madar Research Study.)<br>
<br>
<b>UAE: </b>Etisalat’s mobile customer base has exceeded 5 million, going by the 
latest census figures. New entrant du expects to attract 10 per cent subscribers 
in the first three years of the company’s operations — and pushing for securing 
30 per cent of the overall market between 2007 and 2009.<br>
<br>
<b>Kuwait: </b>The two mobile operators in the country, Wataniya and Mobile 
Telecommunications Co. (MTC) enjoy market shares of around 40 per cent and 60 
per cent, respectively. The cellular penetration rate in Kuwait reached 77 per 
cent due to huge marketing campaigns during 2004. This translates into 2.11 
million subscribers. Fixed lines in use reached 490,000 in 2004, with a 
penetration rate of 17.82 per cent. <br>
<br>
<b>Saudi Arabia: </b>The fall in the growth of land phone networks in the 
Kingdom is mainly attributed to the fast growth of the mobile phone sector. The 
number of mobile phone users reached 13.5 million in 2005, an increase of 60 per 
cent — whereas the growth of land phone networks in Saudi Arabia was 16.3 per 
cent.<br>
Qatar: It’s still a monopolistic sector, with Qatar Telecom (Q-Tel) being the 
sole fixed and mobile telecommunications provider in the country. As of the 
Third Quarter 2005, Q-Tel had 675,400 wireless subscribers and 194,000 fixed 
line subscribers.<br>
<br>
<b>Oman: </b>Mobile penetration rate in Oman was the lowest in the GCC region. 
But things are definitely looking positive — achieving about 34 per cent in 2004 
penetration as against 23 per cent in 2003. The Omani GSM market has been 
invigorated with the entry of the second cellular operator, Nawras Telecom. By 
the end of 2005, the mobile phones market was already enjoying the fruits of a 
healthy competition. At the end of January 2006, the telecom sector in Oman 
recorded a total of 1.67 million subscribers. The primary contributor was mobile 
segment — accounting for 1.33 million subscribers. (As per August 2006 figures 
claimed by the operators, the number of mobile subscribers has crossed 1.6 
million mark.) <br>

		A recent National Bank of Kuwait report says the GCC telecom market

		<br>
		The sector, as a whole, remained highly profitable, with earnings before

		fierce debate over a proposal on property ownership rights being 
		extended to GCC citizens continues to rage — with the business community 
		opposing any limit being imposed on non-tBahraini GCC citizens. In 
		response to a popular demand, members of parliament initiated a proposal 
		to check rising property prices in the country. The final draft of the 
		proposal places two types of limits on the land that non-tBahraini GCC 
		subjects may buy in Bahrain for residential — but not investmtment — 
		purposes. First, the proposed law limits ownership of land plots to a 
		maximum of 5,000 sq mt. Second, it restricts resale of property within 
		the first five years of ownership.<br>
		<br>
		It’s very much known that the common practice of GCC owners is to buy 
		relatively large plots of lands, divide them into small pieces, and then 
		offer them for sale to the geneteral public. The practice ensures 
		maximum profit. In other words, GCC citizens are least interested in 
		small plots of lands, as it limits the profit amount that can be 
		generated. <b><br>
		<br>
		Displeasure<br>
		<br>
		</b>Clearly, the business community has shown its displeasure with the 
		proposal law, arguing that rising property prices is a global phenomenon 
		not restricted to Bahrain. It has suggtgested that rising property 
		prices reflect limited investment channels against a backdrop of 
		relatively low interest rates, together with growing availability of 
		liquidity thanks to firm oil prices. Quite a few have raised doubts 
		about the ability of the proposed law per se to eventually help 
		loweriting property prices.<br>
		<br>
		Others have questioned the second part of the proposal in particular — 
		restricting trading of the property for five years from the date of 
		purchase. They find this restriction uniquely unfair — saying that 
		investors should have the right to liquidate their assets due to 
		changing circumstances, and there can be some sort of property or 
		capital gains tax.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>GCC commitments<br>
		<br>
		</b>The proposed changes of property law do not, in anyway, violate 
		Bahrain’s commitment to the GCC principles. As of date, the GCC is a 
		customs union, which in turn requires adoption of a unified external 
		trade policy with non-memb-bers.<br>
		<br>
		However, the GCC is due to acquire common market status by end-t2007, 
		which in turn stipulates unrestricted freedom of factors of production. 
		Fact is that many of the other GCC governments do place restrictions on 
		property ownership.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Next steps<br>
		<br>
		</b>Other than the elected parliament, the appointed Consultative 
		Council likewise endorsed the proposed law. The next steps involve 
		governmental approval of the draft, followed by issuance of a royal 
		decree. The scheme becomes law once it is published in the official 
		gazette. The authorities had rejected an earlier draft that places 
		similar restrictions on properties held for investment purposes. 
		However, the MPs agreed to confine the restrictions to residential 
		purposes in order to satisfy the government. <br>
		<br>
		It remains to be seen whether the authorities would go ahead and issue 
		the law, or delay the whole matter until after the parliamentary 
		elections. One thing for sure is that the business community is not 
		pleased with proposed changes. Fortunately, the four-year term of the 
		legislative body that originally proposed the law has now expired. Fresh 
		elections are planned during the fourth quarter of the year. Problem is 
		that the proposed law could deny Bahrain a competitive advantage it 
		presently enjoys within the GCC. While limited in resources, Bahrain has 
		traditionally relied on an ‘open door’ policy to attract investments 
		deemed esstsential to stimulate business activity.</font></p>

		Economic City (KAEC), fast emerging on the Red Sea coast of Saudi 
		Arabia, was oversubscribed by 2.82 times. Over 30 per cent of the total 
		subscriptions were made via ATMs. The city is developed by ‘Emaar the 
		Economic City’, a consortium led by the Dubai-based Emaar Properties and 
		Saudi investors, at a total cost of RO10.266 billion. <br>
		<br>
		The single largest private sector initiative in the Kingdom, KAEC covers 
		a Greenfield site of 55 million sq. m. KAEC will undertake mixed-use 
		developments in its six components: a modern world-class seaport, 
		industrial district, financial island, educational and healthcare zone, 
		resorts and the residential area. Groundwork on KAEC is going full steam 
		ahead. The installation of precast walls is nearing completion — and 
		construction of the project’s first boulevard, a 15-km long avenue lined 
		by over 3,000 palm trees, is also underway. The development is slated 
		for completion within two years, and expected to generate over 500,000 
		new jobs for Saudi nationals.</font></td>

		recreational shoppers in the world. They shop once a week for “something 
		to do”, or just for “entertainment”. A recent online shopping study 
		byACNielsen says that the UAE shoppers are fast closing in on the Hong 
		Kong shopper. The online consumer confidence survey conducted in 42 
		markets reported that 30 per cent of consumers in the UAE go shopping 
		“at least once a week.” This figure was only second to Hong Kong which 
		stands at 36 per cent. But the UAE’s shoppers can rest easy. Their 
		combined percentage ranks among the top 10 worldwide at 84 per cent. 
		This cumulative figure is of those who shop twice a week or more, or 
		once a week, or once a month, or even less than once a month.<br>
		<br>
		“With 
		the emergence of a new middle class and opportunities for spending in 
		the UAE, it is understandable that there is huge enthusiasm about 
		shopping,” said Piyush Mathur, Managing Director, ACNielsen MENAP 
		region. “Another key factor is the weather conditions. With nearly six 
		months of hot temperatures, people seek indoor entertainment — usually 
		in a mall or hypermarket. This has driven a growing trend in 
		shopertainment.”<br>

<b>Gulf Air Muscat traffic jumps by 30.1% </b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="gulf_air.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" style="border: 1px dotted #C0C0C0; padding-left: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px" width="160" height="117">Introduction 
of a two-hub strategy earlier this year, and the increase in Gulf Air flights to 
and from Oman and Bahrain, has produced a record passenger traffic at both the 
airline’s hubs. Releasing passenger figures for the year till June 2006, Gulf 
Air has announced a 30.1 per cent increase to 1,137,482 travellers through 
Muscat, and a 32.3 per cent increase to 2,181,227 travellers through Bahrain, 
compared to last year’s figures. <br>
<br>
The airline’s outgoing President and Chief Executive James Hogan said, “In the 
first quarter, we recorded growth of 20.6 and 24.1 per cent, respectively. 
However, when the full impact of the two-hub model came into effect with the 
summer schedule in the second quarter, the growth increased to 39 per cent in 
Oman and 41.3 per cent in Bahrain. Few airports in the world could handle 
year-on-year growth of even half that level.”<br>
<br>
Hogan added, “We have started to see significant trends coming from our two-hub 
operation, in terms of crewing, aircraft utilisation and network connections — 
with the full impact becoming apparent in April following the introduction of 
the summer schedule. As a result, we expect an overall positive impact on our 
services this year. While some challenges and uncertainties remain in 2006, 
notably fuel costs, I believe we have a sound basis for continued positive 
development in the future.”<br>
<br>
Since the introduction of the two-hub strategy, the number of direct non-stop 
Gulf Air flights to and from Seeb International Airport has increased by 45.5 
per cent over last year and the airline now accounts for nearly 60 per cent of 
the passengers at the airport, as per a Gulf Air press statement.</font></td>

Government revenue up by 39.8%</b><br>

The Omani government’s revenue increased by 39.8 per cent during the first six 
months of this year to RO3,420 million, against RO2,446.5 million during the 
corresponding period in 2005, according to the monthly statistical bulletin 
issued by the Ministry of National Economy. The rise in revenue was attributed 
to a 33.5 per cent surge in the Sultanate’s oil net revenues which rose to 
RO2,542 million, compared to RO1,904.4 million during the same period in 2005, 
and a 120.2 per cent rise in natural gas revenues which stood at RO305.7

months of this year to RO1,892 million, against RO1,826.6 million during the 
same period in 2005. <br>
<br>
The rise in the general expenditure resulted from a 3.4 per cent increase in 
current spending which stood at RO1,467.8 million, as against RO1,419.3 million 
during the same period in 2005, and a 37.3 per cent surge in contribution and

		Next generation e-publishing solutions in Oman<br>
		</b><br>
		Bahwan CyberTek, in partnership with BSEEN International, has launched a 
		new generation e-publishing technology developed by Innotive 
		Corporation. Using an IPQ (Intelligent Pixel Query) technology, 
		e-publishing solutions can be used to publish maps, newspapers, 
		multimedia e-books, advertisements, videos, photos, brochures and 
		catalogues, or any other electronic files in 2D or 3D format. For 
		example, a newspaper can be published online using e-publishing 
		solutions in a 2D format — enabling a reader to read it online as if he 
		is reading a real newspaper with zoom in and zoom out and page flipping 
		facilities. All this in real time, without waiting for any downloads.
		<br>
		<br>
		The core of the IPQ technology is pixel-on-demand in which high quality 
		images, videos, flashes and audio content can be transferred via real 
		time streaming method saving the hassle of downloading. The contents can 
		be viewed or utilised selectively regardless of hardware type or size. 
		The principal idea behind IPQ is to replace today’s standard navigation 
		interfaces with a simple yet powerful non-linear zoomable user interface 
		(ZUI). The IPQ format also is in its one source multi-platform usage. 
		The same IPQ can be streamed over various networks (wireless, mobile, 
		broadband) and platforms (PC, mobile, PDA, touchscreens etc). </font></td>

            Smith, the renowned Scottish economist, mesmerised the global 
            corporate community with his book Wealth of Nations way back in 
            1776. Currents of Adam Smith ran through David Ricardo and Karl Marx 
            in the 19th century, and through Robert Keynes and Thomas Friedman 
            in the 20th. But it has now taken the shape of modern day management 
            (business and motivational) gurus who are jetsetting across the 
            world — hobnobbing with business managers, political leaders and 
            entertainment stars with equal aplomb. Promising to transform the 
            fortunes of individuals and institutions with their simple yet 
            analytical thinking, they have turned into an industry themselves!<br>
            <br>
            The management guru trend picked up momentum in the ‘80s — mainly in 
            the US and Europe market. Growing competition and changing market 
            equations in the global village made the global corporates line up 
            to listen to these spin doctors, with the objective of safeguarding 
            their business interests. The rest of the world followed suit in the 
            ‘90s. Corporate Oman which hitherto was flocking to Dubai, the focal 
            point for the global management gurus in the Gulf region, realised 
            the need to make these gurus visit the Sultanate to spread the 
            benefits from their know-ledge on a broad level here.<br>
            <b><br>
            Spin doctors in Oman</b><br>
            Management thinkers have been coming to Oman before too... But their 
            frequency and stature have gone up substantially in the last two 
            years. Earlier, it was unthinkable to have gurus such as Michael E. 
            Porter, Tom Peters, Ron Kaufman, Jack Canfield and Deepak Chopra 
            dropping in at Muscat in quick succession. More and more event 
            management and human resource development agencies are coming 
            forward to arrange, and manage, interactions between the gurus and 
            Corporate Oman right here in Muscat. Why this sudden change? <br>
            <br>
            “This marked shift is a cumulative effect of various developments in 
            the Sultanate. The competition has gone up. An increased integration 
            with the global market has led to more exposure for the 
            organisations and individuals. With more international companies 
            coming in, the realisation has set in that we need to change, learn 
            and know new things,” says C.E. Potnis, Group General Manager, Oman 
            Resources Development Consultants LLC (ORDC), which brought Jack 
            Canfield to Oman in December last year. <br>
            <br>
            It is said that half of the vision gets lost in the implementation. 
            Most of the organisations don’t have a problem in the strategy 
            planning; the problem comes in its execution. On a number of 
            occasions the basic aspects to achieve the objectives are lost in 
            the process of strategy implementation. That’s where the management 
            gurus step in.<br>
            <b><br>
            Who benefits</b><br>
            So how effective are these management gurus in bringing a change in 
            the culture and productivity of a company? There are divergent views 
            on this subject. Broadly speaking, beyond immediate business gains, 
            such sessions place Oman on the global map and attract the audience 
            from nearby countries to add to the tourism sector of the Sultanate. 
            They also impact the thinking of the youth, especially Omanis 
            charting out their career path and developing their own style of 
            management and leadership. <br>
            <br>
            Raphael Parambi, CEO, Muscat Finance Company, who has attended many 
            sessions with these gurus says, “At my age, these gentlemen 
            (management gurus) are not going to tell me anything that I don’t 
            know. But it refreshes the whole thing in my mind, hearing it again. 
            Hearing a new slant adds value. People like Tom Peters don’t add 
            much technical knowledge. But there’s a certain inspirational aspect 
            to it — talking of change, the need to change, how fast the world is 
            changing, how we’ll get left behind. Those kind of things which are 
            not generally taught at traditional management schools. Same is the 
            case with Jack Canfield whom I like for his inspirational and 
            positive thinking — always worth stepping back and thinking about.”<br>
            <br>
            N. Ramesh, CEO, Dalma Energy LLC agrees with Parambi. He says, 
            “Generally, we find such sittings quite productive. Take, for 
            example, a recent seminar Bricks to Bridges by Robin Speculand. My 
            team and I felt that the seminar re-emphasised things we have known 
            all along, but which tend to get forgotten in our daily activities. 
            The opportunity to stand back and reflect on how we are running our 
            business, and compare the problems we are facing with those being 
            faced by other organisations, was really useful.”<br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, a general manager of a large automotive sales 
            firm believes that these management gurus are not as effective as 
            they are made out to be. He says, “To make my team members attend a 
            session with a guru means that the company has to invest in their 
            entry fee — and secondly, they will be away from the duty for that 
            many hours. I don’t expect them to learn anything great in a single 
            day which is going to impact my company’s productivity drastically. 
            If their education and work experience has not taught them enough 
            all these years, then how can I expect them to change in a single 
            session!”<br>
            <br>
            Potnis disagrees completely with this logic. “Many a time in life, 
            what your entire education may not teach you, one event, one 
            setback, one success, one interaction, one audience, one handshake 
            can really change your life. If we look back on our lives, there is 
            always one incident which changes the way we think. These people 
            (gurus) bring in the world of experience with them; they bring in a 
            unique thought process. They have a great skill of articulating and 
            putting it across, using a lot of anecdotes and stories — and it 
            becomes so inspiring. Out of an audience of hundred, even if only 
            two people are benefitted, it’s a tremendous contribution — because 
            it creates an environment and culture. The impact becomes visible 
            over a period of time.”<br>
            <br>
            S. Suresh, Corporate Head of Al-Hashar Group of Companies, offers a 
            balanced view. “It will be naive on our part to assume that a day or 
            a session of talk by any management guru can change the destiny of 
            professionals or companies. To me, a session with a management guru 
            is like reading a book. The effect is very subjective and completely 
            dependent on the reader of the book. The key advantage is that these 
            sessions bring in a new perspective to any problem, and to that 
            extent are very useful.”<br>
            Amit Sampath, Director, Gazelle International that brought in Ron 
            Kaufman to Oman, also believes that a lot depends upon the 
            individual — how much he is able to understand what the guru is 
            trying to convey. “At times, there are disappointments too. For 
            example, some people gave the feedback that Ron Kaufman said what 
            they already knew. On the contrary, Kaufman was trying to say that 
            sometimes when you’re already into the business, you tend to ignore 
            the basic requirements, and that’s what he focused on.<br>
            <br>
            So Kaufman asked the sales persons, ‘What do you do when the 
            customer comes in?’ Some said that we note down their requirements. 
            Well, that’s exactly what you’re not supposed to do, he said. He 
            emphasised that when the customer comes in, you’re supposed to make 
            them comfortable saying ‘Hi, what’s the problem? How can I help 
            you?’ So, sometimes people miss the entire idea of the event. I 
            mean, there’s always mixed feelings about any event. There’s no way 
            you can satisfy 300 people at the same time,” concluded Sampath.</font></p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Guru’s feedback</b><br>
            Last December, OER met Jack Canfield on his maiden trip to Oman. We 
            asked him, “Do you think management gurus can really change lives of 
            the people?” He said, “It depends upon individual to individual in 
            the audience. Like, in a school, all the students listen and try to 
            follow the lecture of the teacher. But finally the end result, or 
            the learning, varies from student to student. The same principle 
            applies in our case as well.”<br>
            He also shared some of his success stories with us. “Some time back, 
            a gentleman who was into public speaking attended my seven-day long 
            workshop on learning success principles. He said, ‘After attending 
            your workshop I have become a millionaire in two years. I have 
            tripled my public speaking business. More than that, my children say 
            that they have got a new father. They say that I have changed after 
            coming from the workshop. They say that I listen to them and don’t 
            lecture them. I understand that their needs 
            are different. I don’t give them everything that they want, but I’m 
            more understanding now’.”<br>
            <br>
            Canfield told OER: “A few years back in one of my workshops I had a 
            person who was working as a sales trainer with a large corporation, 
            earning US$140,000 a year. He was stuck in that position for quite 
            long, and he didn’t have a clue why he had not been able to progress 
            further in his life. We did an exercise with him to become more 
            successful in life. One year later he was making US$750,000 a year, 
            working just three days a week.” Need we say more!<br>
            <b><br>
            Knowledge sharing</b><br>
            Most of the time, the knowledge gained is restricted to the 
            individuals who attend the guru’s session. On most of the occasions, 
            people come, enjoy the moments, do social networking, and the next 
            day, crack jokes on the session with their colleagues. The majority 
            of senior managers admitted off the record that the entire process, 
            of converting the knowledge gained into productivity for the 
            company, usually went for a toss. Why? Due to the lack of a proper 
            mechanism to instill these lessons among others in the company who 
            didn’t get an opportunity to attend the sessions.<br>
            <br>
            “Generally the top management of a company gets to attend these 
            premium events. Ideally, the senior managers should hold sessions 
            with their team members in a structured manner post-event — to 
            disseminate the knowledge and discuss ways to adopt the learning so 
            as to improve the company’s operational efficiency and strategic 
            planning. But that rarely happens,” shares a customer care executive 
            working in a prominent bank. It is quite discouraging that Corporate 
            Oman fails to take optimum advantage from the presence of management 
            stalwarts, as the organisers take huge pains to bring them here. 
            (See box Bottlenecks for the Organisers)<br>
            <b><br>
            Follow-up mechanism</b><br>
            What happens when one faces practical problems in following what the 
            gurus had prescribed? Whom does one rely on for the solutions? We 
            can’t imagine managing directors or chief executives asking their 
            colleagues for solutions! The solution has to come from the guru 
            himself. Though all gurus leave their contact details, we can’t 
            expect them to reply to each individual query.<br>
            <br>
            “That’s not the case,” disagrees Sampath of Gazelle International. 
            “Ron Kaufman is quite prompt in replying to anyone’s queries. He 
            generally takes just 24 hours to respond. He likes to continue the 
            relationship post-event also, to understand and help his audience to 
            following his advice.” But not many are like Kaufman. <br>
            <b><br>
            Language barrier</b><br>
            Generally, most of the management gurus are English speaking. They 
            deliver their discourses in English, which alienates the Arabic 
            speaking public as many may not follow English perfectly. It means 
            that only the English speaking expatriates and Omanis benefit from 
            these gurus. The problem can be tackled in two ways. One is to 
            invite Arabic speaking management gurus as well — however there may 
            be a shortage of them in the top bracket.<br>
            <br>
            Gazelle International is planning to bring in some Arabic speaking 
            management spin doctors to Oman. But obviously they would be of a 
            lesser stature compared to stalwarts such as Michael Porter, Tom 
            Peters or Jack Canfield. A second option could be an arrangement of 
            simultaneous Arabic translation. “We evaluated doing simultaneous 
            translation from English to Arabic. But we shelved the idea as we 
            felt that the effectiveness and impact of the talk would just go 
            away,” says Potnis, ORDC Group General Manager.<br>
            <b><br>
            The way forward</b><br>
            In discussions with the corporate honchos over the last few months, 
            OER found that there is an additional element of disgruntlement 
            among them over such events. The main grouse is related to the value 
            proposition vis-a-vis cost factor. Some of the events have high 
            entry fees (in excess of RO200 per participant in some cases), which 
            they find exorbitant.<br>
            <br>
            Another telling point was that many of these highflying gurus take 
            no pains to factorise in Oman while giving their presentations — 
            thus reducing the degree of effectiveness for corporate Oman. 
            Majority of the gurus tend to recycle one of their existing 
            presentations, made umpteen number of times in other places already. 
            Perhaps, for many of them Muscat trip is just an add-on to their 
            trip to Dubai, opined a senior manager who felt shortchanged. “They 
            should not take corporate Oman for granted,” was the candid comment.
            <br>
            Another way to look at this problem is not to invite the guru 
            himself. A management doyen here could well present the ideas of the 
            gurus to the local corporate community. That would help make such 
            events more affordable for the companies — and a higher number of 
            middle and junior level professionals would gain from the knowledge.<br>
            <br>
            The gurus’ effectiveness can be gauged when, as it happens in the 
            other markets, more management professionals in Oman start paying 
            from their own pockets to attend these high-profile sessions S — 
            instead of relying on complimentary entry or company sponsorship.<br>
            <br>
            In spite of the teething troubles, most of these “management guru” 
            events have been well received in Oman. And the trend favours more 
            of the same. The economy is on a roll, leading to massive 
            investments in infrastructure developments activities. A renewed 
            thrust has been given to key sectors such as telecom, tourism, 
            retailing, banking and finance, and manufacturing industries besides 
            trading. Both the government and private sector are embarking on an 
            Omanisation drive.<br>
            <br>
            All this calls for the training and development at different levels 
            — whether it is related to leadership and strategic planning for the 
            top-level managers, or skill upgradation and motivational uplifting 
            for mid level managers. Though change is definitely taking place, it 
            is still treated as more of an expense than an investment for the 
            company. The faster the mindset changes, the better it is for 
            Corporate Oman.</font></p>

                  OER talks to Ron Kaufman in the US about his session in Oman<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Please comment on your recent Oman session?</b><br>
                  The audience was tremendously receptive. It’s clear that Oman 
                  is moving quickly into a more competitive market space. I 
                  shared many examples of best practices from leading service 
                  companies around the world. The Omani audience appeared quite 
                  interested to “learn from the best” in various industries. 
                  There were good questions posed about the relevance of 
                  international examples to the Oman market. The possibility of 
                  developing Oman into a world-class tourist destination was 
                  enthusiastically embraced, with a clear understanding that 
                  tourists are very experienced customers who recognise, and 
                  expect, the very best.<br>
                  <b>
                  <br>
                  How the audience could have benefited more from your session?</b><br>
                  With a large group, there’s always a limit to how much “group 
                  interaction” is possible. I believe each company and 
                  organisation attending the event should spend the next day in 
                  immediate discussions, to identify specifically how and when 
                  they can APPLY what they have learned in the session with me. 
                  Ideas are terrific, but ACTION is what really counts.<br>
                  <b>
                  <br>
                  Did you make any special preparation for your session in Oman?</b><br>
                  Yes, I have visited Oman several times before, and always use 
                  local examples in my presentations — airline, immigration, 
                  hotel and resort facilities, banking, diving and shopping. Of 
                  course, these are the very same facilities many international 
                  tourists will use. So, for those in these sectors, the 
                  examples are highly relevant. I also read local stories on 
                  websites prior to arrival — to have a sense of some of the key 
                  economic issues the country is working on each time I visit.</font></td>

                  Going by the feedback from the companies and individuals, the 
                  hurdles in getting top-notch management gurus to Oman pertains 
                  to the gurus themselves as well as the market here. The 
                  management gurus commanding immense popularity and demand all 
                  over the world have become cult figures. Naturally, their 
                  demands are also very high. Take, for example, Michael E. 
                  Porter, the world’s No.1 management guru as per Accenture (see 
                  box Top 10 Business Gurus).<br>
                  According to a senior executive closely associated with the 
                  visit of Porter to Oman: “It took us almost two years to fly 
                  him here, that too on an invitation from the Minister of 
                  Commerce &amp; Industry. He charged more than RO50,000 as his 
                  fees. He fixed the date and timing of the visit. He came on 
                  the condition that he must fly back the same night to Tokyo on 
                  a chartered flight. He spoke to me for just 30 seconds after 
                  the presentation, as if he was doing a big favour to me. I 
                  think he believes that he is God!”<br>
                  <br>
                  While the fees range from RO20,000 to RO60,000, depending upon 
                  the guru’s stature, boarding and lodging charges come steep 
                  too. Add marketing and logistics cost, the total budget for 
                  the event goes very high. The organisers rely on sponsorships 
                  and participation fees to meet the overall expenses.<br>
                  <br>
                  Raphael Parambi, CEO, Muscat Finance Co. says, “It’s not easy 
                  to find people who appreciate your effort by backing you. In 
                  this market a lot of people don’t like to pay to attend the 
                  guru sessions. On the contrary, many of them go to such kind 
                  of paid events in Dubai! Of course, the top-end gurus manage 
                  to attract a paid audience in Oman. But those who are of 
                  slightly less stature fail to attract enough paid audience.”<br>
                  <br>
                  C.E. Potnis, Group General Manager, Oman Resources Development 
                  Consultants LLC (ORDC) adds, “The corporates’ attitude is 
                  definitely changing. But Oman still has a long way to go, 
                  compared to a market like Dubai. The government and the 
                  private sector should recognise the importance of holding such 
                  events in the Sultanate. The increasing influx of gurus to 
                  Oman also points out that we are moving in the right 
                  direction. The need of the hour is to accelerate the pace.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Another challenge is the small size of the market. In bigger 
                  markets, the sheer number of companies is much higher, 
                  compared to Oman. Also, the event organisers have a large pool 
                  of companies to target for sponsorship and delegation fees. 
                  But that’s not the case in Oman.<br>
                  <br>
                  “We can’t expect the same set of companies to back us six 
                  times a year if we bring more gurus to Oman. There has to be 
                  enough number of large corporates who could invest on a 
                  rotational basis without feeling the pinch. In Oman, we rush 
                  to the same telecom, banking or automotive firms to endorse 
                  our events,” clarifies Amit Sampath, Director, Gazelle 
                  International.</font></td>

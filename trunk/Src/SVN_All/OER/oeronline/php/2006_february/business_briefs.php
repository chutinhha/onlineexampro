                    National Bank of Oman SAOG has bounced back with a net 
                    profit of RO 20.3 million in 2005, the highest in NBO’s 
                    history, as against a profit of RO 5.2 million reported for 
                    the year ended 31 December 2004. After a break of four 
                    years, NBO has resumed dividend payment by declaring a cash 
                    dividend of 15 per cent. <br>
                    <br>
                    Although there was an increasing interest rate scenario in 
                    2005, the bank has been able to register an increase in net 
                    interest margin as compared to 2004. The bank has been 
                    successful in overcoming its past challenges with regard to 
                    the large level of non-performing loans (NPLs) and its 
                    resultant impact on the profitability of the bank. <br>
                    <br>
                    The 
                    position has stabilized in 2005 with lower loan loss 
                    provisions of RO 17 million as compared to RO 31 million in 
                    2004 and higher recoveries from provisions of RO 20 million 
                    as compared to RO 18 million in 2004. Also the level of 
                    NPLs’ to gross loans was lower at 15 per cent as compared to 
                    31 per cent and the provision coverage has further improved 
                    to 84 per cent in 2005 as compared to 81 per cent in 2004.

                    NBO’s CEO Andrew Duff added, “The bank is focusing on 
                    qualitative aspects as well. Omanisation is currently at 
                    92.5 per cent with all branches continuing to be fully 
                    manned by Omani staff. In addition, steps to increase 
                    motivation and performance of the staff are being taken, 
                    including a proposal for a 5-day work week for staff with 
                    the bank remaining open for six days.”</font></td>

                              Executive Vice President, PEIE said: “Given 
                              initial attendee feedback, the conference has to 
                              be described as an outstanding success. The seven 
                              sessions that made up the two day program plus the 
                              Lean Enterprise Workshop held on the 25th at 
                              Knowledge Oasis Muscat all went extremely well and 
                              we’re delighted with the outcome and the momentum 
                              the event has generated.” <br>
                              <br>
                              In delivering the Conference closing remarks, Al 
                              Ghassani said: “Oman’s Manufacturing is a success 
                              story – we excel in ceramics; precision 
                              engineering; furniture; fibre optics; batteries; 
                              textiles through to food processing. Indeed, 
                              manufacturing is a major contributor to Oman’s 
                              national wealth. It accounts for a major slice of 
                              our exports and provides thousands of jobs and 
                              supports a flourishing service sector. Our best 
                              manufacturers and best products are world class 
                              and sought after in the most highly competitive 
                              markets around the globe.”<br>
                              <br>
                              However, he admitted that manufacturers also face 
                              huge challenges. As discussed at the conference, 
                              the future of Oman’s manufacturing depends on 
                              raising investment, applying innovation and 
                              technology, smarter marketing, design and 
                              packaging, best practice and skills to create even 
                              better products that the world wants to buy. <br>
                              <br>
                              To ensure that the momentum created by the 
                              Conference is maintained, Al Ghassani announced 
                              PEIE’s intention to establish a Manufacturing 
                              Discussion Group – a group that would aim to 
                              stimulate ideas and discussion in priority areas 
                              such as skills development, marketing, design, 
                              links between industry and academia, technology, 
                              logistics, new markets and the image of 
                              manufacturing. <br>
                              <br>
                              “No one would claim that the way ahead for Oman’s 
                              manufacturing is easy. Recent failures highlight 
                              some of the difficulties. But they are only a tiny 
                              fraction of the overall equation. Manufacturing 
                              commitment to high value and skills, together with 
                              extensive practical government support and 
                              maintenance of the right conditions for business 
                              to flourish will enable Oman-based manufacturers 
                              to compete in the long-term. And that’s good news 
                              for everyone,” concluded Al Ghassani.</font></td>

                    The legendary golfer Greg Norman has been entrusted 
                            with the task of designing the golf course (the 
                            first sea-facing course in the Sultanate) for the 
                            Wave project. To be built on 800,000 square metres 
                            area, the signature 18-hole Championship Golf Course 
                            will include Golf and Country Club equipped with 
                            sports, banquet and conference facilities. It will 
                            also have a teaching academy and driving range. The 
                            construction of the waterfront is expected to start 
                            in the summer. <br>
                            <br>
                            Norman, who arrived in his private jet in Muscat in 
                            January to initiate the planning process, promised 
                            to be environmentally sensitive while designing the 
                            golf course. He said that he would take care of 
                            nature’s preservation and utilize treated sewage 
                            effluent water for irrigation. Greg Norman’s Golf 
                            Course Design is the leading global signature golf 
                            course design firms with 51 courses to its credit 
                            already and another 30 projects in various stages of 
                            development. <br>
                            <br>
                            Wael Ahmed Al Lawati, Acting CEO of The Wave said: 
                            “Partnering with Greg Norman is consistent with our 
                            philosophy of associating with the best in the 
                            businesses. His expertise and association with some 
                            of the most prestigious golf courses across the 
                            globe will be invaluable towards making the golfing 
                            experience at the Wave truly rewarding and 
                            memorable.”<br>

                            On the golfing scene in Oman, Norman said, “&quot;I'm 
                            sure the OER CEO Golf event with unique features 
                            like golf clinic for beginners, glow golf, CEO's 
                            competing with each other... is going to stimulate

                    and that it had proven experience in the specified areas, 
                    including reference customers. Imtac also had to present a

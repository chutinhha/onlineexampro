OTE Group has introduced Hyundai’s new model, Azera, in Oman. The Korean auto 
giant’s executive class sedan powered by 3.3 litre engine is equipped with 
5-speed electronically controlled automatic gearbox with H-matic. Sheikh Saad 
Suhail Bahwan, Chairman of OTE Group said, “ The year 2005 has been very 
successful for Hyundai in Oman. The new Sonata was so well accepted that we 
struggled to meet the demand from the customers. Similar has been the success 
with Tucson. We have broken all previous records. I’m sure with the launch of 
Azera, the success story will continue to unfold.” On the sales and service 
front, he added that OTE was planning to add two more Hyundai showrooms in 2006.</font></p>

“The Middle East market contributes to around 2 per cent of Mazda’s global

competitors from Japan, Europe and the US, auto companies from Korea, China and

Mazda has started the year by unveiling two of its exciting new models at the 
2006 North American International Auto Show held at Detroit. The first one is 
Mazda Kabura, the compact sports coupe concept vehicle. Kabura combines the 
pleasures of a sports car with functionality, targeted for the first time car

arrow that whistles when fired and was used to signal the start of the battle.<br>
The second one is Mazda CX-7, a five-seater crossover sports-utility-vehicle 
(SUV) that blends sports car verve and SUV practicality. It’s equipped with a 
high-powered engine that produces 244 horsepower at 5,000 rpm and keeps fuel

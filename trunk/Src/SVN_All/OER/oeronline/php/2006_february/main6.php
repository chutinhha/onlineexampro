In less than 15 years, an unknown banking entity transforms itself into a giant 
at home and the Gulf region through innovative and aggressive growth plans. 
Group Editor Ramesh Kumar examines the success of Bank Muscat.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>I</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">t 
is heady days at the headquarters of BankMuscat on Al Markazhi Road. For the 
third consecutive year, it has been anointed with the best forex bank in Oman 
award by the New York-based Global Finance, a reputed financial publication. The 
winners were selected by Global Finance editors with inputs from industry 
analysts, corporate executives and technology experts based on a slew of 
criteria: transaction volume, market share, scope of global coverage, customer 
coverage, competitive pricing and innovative technologies. <br>
<br>
In the fast-changing world of finance, downing one’s guard may lead to disaster. 
Such things are common in the global corporate scenario. Growth can be achieved 
in two ways: organic and non-organic. Simply put, building up an organization 
from the grassroots levels to higher pinnacles is organic. Those who resort to 
mergers and acquisitions to grow fast – without going through the hassles of 
time-consuming organic growth fall in the category of non-organic. BankMuscat 
believes in the second option.<br>
<br>
“The bank realised a long time ago that by continuing to be small, it would call 
upon itself many restrictions and open itself up to substantial risks that it 
might not be in a position to afford. This drove us to look at a strategy that 
combines the bet of organic and non-organic growth strategies,” says BankMuscat 
Chief Executive Abdulrazak Ali Issa, in an exclusive interview to Oman Economic 
Review (See Box: ’We’re open to all quality growth opportunities’).<br>
<br>
Though its acquisition drive, the merger of the National Bank of Oman in 2004, 
failed to materialise due to a variety of reasons, BankMuscat is not a single 
banking entity but comprises of eight other banks. The impact of 
BankMuscat-National Bank of Oman merger would have been profound not only on the 
banking sector in the Sultanate, but across the Gulf Cooperation Council region 
as well. The two Muscat-headquartered banking giants are in the first and second 
slots respectively in Oman. If BankMuscat has exposure to Bahrain through 
BankMuscat International, licensed in 2005, and India through its acquisition of 
Centurion Bank, National Bank of Oman has operations in the United Arab Emirates 
and Egypt. <br>
<br>
“BankMuscat commands the largest branch network (90) in addition to possessing 
relatively well-developed alternative delivery channels such as online and phone 
banking,” say Karim Kamal and Basil Al-Salem of Gulf Investment Corporation 
while commenting on the Oman banking scenario. BankMuscat’s primary place among 
the peers becomes all the more riveting when it is understood that the Omani 
banking sector is “relatively less dependent on government support than its GCC 
counterparts”. Even though it has substantial government ownership (See chart on 
shareholding pattern), BankMuscat does not benefit heavily in terms of 
government borrowing and deposits.<br>
<br>
BankMuscat is the second largest market capitalization company on the Muscat 
Securities Market (RO 622,522,000 as on 7 December 2005) and constitutes around 
25 per cent weightage on the MSM Index. According to the latest research report 
of Fincorp, BankMuscat is “strengthening its position both in conventional and 
non-conventional areas of banking.” Under conventional banking side, its loan 
size has grown from RO1,098 million in 2001 to RO1,209 million in 2005. Its fund 
deployment strategy reveals its strength. A sizeable chunk of its lendable funds 
find a parking slot in other banks enabling it with ready reserves if a genuine 
need arises, kind of call money, at any time!</font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Under the 
non-conventional banking arena, BankMuscat is strengthening its presence in 
investment banking. It lead managed the issue of Taager Finance and Omantel and 
was one of the lead arranger for Aromatics Oman with a commitment of US$55 
million. <br>
<br>
With the full backing of the power-packed Board, Abdulrazak Ali Issa is busy 
chalking out brighter future plans. In pure numerical terms, the bank’s earnings 
are growing at a steady pace. If it grew at an incredible rate of 22 per cent in 
2003 and 2004, for the year 2005 its growth should be in the upper region of 30 
per cent, forecast researchers at Fincorp. “On the whole, it appears that the 
financials are well positioned, indicating a sustained and steady growth,” 
points out the research report. <br>
<br>
Bank analysts are full of praise for BankMuscat for its pro-activeness. At a 
time when the Federal Reserve is gradually pushing the interest rate and given 
Oman’s strong correlation with it, banks are expected to come under tremendous 
pressure from lower interest spread and lower income from lending activities. To 
offset any hiccups in its interest-bearing activities, all banks have to look at 
fresh avenues, including non-interest income activities such as private banking, 
credit card operations, investment banking and asset management companies. 
BankMuscat is seems to be heading in the right direction. <br>
<br>
Mopping up of funds has led the bank to float its Global Depository Receipts 
(GDR) initiative, which fetched US$163 million in the last quarter of 2005. It 
is an issue of “great significance to us,” says the BankMuscat Chief Executive. 
This single step enabled the Omani bank to walk away with one more laurel: the 
first bank from across the Gulf region and the first Omani institution to be 
listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the process, this had enabled the inflow 
of US$163 million worth foreign direct investment into Oman. But skeptics are 
still out. “By listing the GDR, the bank might have become visible 
internationally, but it has put an added pressure on the stock price since it 
will have to compete with the London market valuations to justify its current 
price,” points out Fincorp research head Uppili Appan. Nonetheless, he hastens 
to add that the upside potential is in the region of 20 per cent plus.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="glob-des.jpg" width="120" height="169" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2">Says 
a senior BankMuscat official: “It is the bank’s philosophy to provide 
transparent and meaningful disclosures in its financial statements. In the last 
few years, it adopted international accounting standards before they became 
mandatory. The rating agencies and industry analysts appreciate the Bank’s 
disclosures.” Analysts at Gulf Investment Corporation share the same sentiments. 
“To address the issue of relatively high loans to deposits, most banks are 
raising other sources of funds to increase their lending capabilities and reduce 
risk.” As against National Bank of Oman’s Baa3 for long term deposits and D 
minus for Financial Strength Rating (FSR) given by Moody’s, BankMuscat gets D 
plus for its FSR from the same Moody’s. While S&amp;P has given BBB minus for 
BankMuscat, Fitch gave Treble B. <br>
<br>
For a bank that is pursuing an aggressive growth path, keeping the regulator 
happy is a necessity. Across the globe, banking regulators are extra vigilant to 
ensure that no single banking entity corners the rest of the pack and suo moto 
assumes the de facto regulator’s role. Central Bank of Oman (CBO) is no 
different and it does not tolerate any waywardness. Expectedly, it has emerged 
as one of the most respected banking regulators in the GCC region. Even at the 
crescendo of the BankMuscat-National Bank of Oman merger talks in 2004, the CBO 
brushed aside murmurs in some quarters concerning prospective ”monopolistic 
structure” of the Omani banking scenario. <br>
<br>
Oman’s financial sector has been considerably strengthened in recent years with 
a modern financial system that caters to the development and growth process of 
the economy. Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries participated 
largely in the country’s efforts to achieve sustainable growth. <br>
<br>
BankMuscat, in less than 15 years, has established itself as the leader of the 
banking fraternity in Oman. The Omani economy is embarking on a new journey with 
the unveiling of Seventh Five Year Plan (2006-2010) where a concerted effort is 
being made to move away from the greater dependence on oil to fuel all-round 
growth. This basically gets translated into increased manufacturing activity, 
which further requires more financial leverage. <br>
<br>
Moreover, the gradual opening up of the economy to foreign direct investment is 
likely to usher in increased need for banking and financial services. BankMuscat 
is well entrenched in offering a variety of such services under its canopy. <br>
With the economy picking up momentum, BankMuscat, with its deep rural reach, is 
perched already. Above all, its obsession with innovation – remember the launch 
of bancassurance, a novelty in Oman? – is bound to catapult BankMuscat to 
greater heights.

		share his thoughts on the bank in a dialogue with Group Editor Ramesh 
		Kumar. Excerpts:</b><br>
		<b><br>
		It seems BankMuscat’s appetite remains insatiable. What is the 
		philosophy behind this urge to grow big? Did the failure of merger 
		process with National Bank of Oman impact you adversely?</b><br>
		Even as we speak, we actually comprise eight other banks today with 
		which we have been in successful merger situations. BankMuscat’s growth 
		strategy has been derived from our objective of becoming one of the 
		foremost banks across the region by the turn of the decade. Early on in 
		the history of the bank, one of the key components of growth identified 
		was the need for ‘critical mass’. The Board and Management of the bank 
		realised a long time ago that by continuing to be small, the bank would 
		call upon itself many restrictions and open it up to substantial risks 
		that it might not be in a position to take on. This drove us to look at 
		a strategy that combines the best of organic and non-organic growth 
		strategies. <br>
		<br>
		I really wouldn’t read too much into the failure of our merger talks. 
		The National Bank of Oman is the oldest, and second largest, bank in 
		Oman. I am sure they will continue to grow and prosper in their own 
		right. Our strategy continues to be open to considering all quality 
		growth opportunities that come our way, be they of an organic or 
		non-organic nature.<br>
		<b><br>
		Recently your bank got listed on the London Stock Exchange and became 
		the first bank in GCC to do so. How is it going to help your 
		bottom-line?</b><br>
		The Global Depository Receipts (GDR) issue is of great significance to 
		us as a bank and as a leading Omani institution. We have today become 
		the first bank from across the Gulf region and the first Omani 
		institution to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. This indeed is a 
		reason for pride and celebration as it has also allowed us to take Oman 
		– the country, economy and financial sector - to international investor 
		and fund manager audiences who have shown their overwhelming support for 
		the same. The GDR not only allowed us to significantly diversify our 
		investor base, but also allowed us to bring in an additional US$ 163 
		million into the country by way of the FDI route. The issue, you may 
		recall, was oversubscribed several times.<br>
		<b><br>
		Is being a listed entity on the bourses a pain or pleasure? How do you 
		cope up with this inevitability?</b><br>
		BankMuscat has been a public limited company for quite some time now. We 
		have a full-fledged set-up at our head office in Oman that is focused on 
		managing our growing investor base in Oman and across Luxembourg, London 
		and Bahrain. We believe we have a duty to perform to each of our valued 
		investors and look upon meeting these to the best of our ability.<br>
		<b><br>
		Oman is your playfield. How is your progress in terms of rural reach? 
		How fruitful has your attempt to go beyond Muscat proved?</b><br>
		BankMuscat has a retail network of 90 branches and close to 170 ATMs to 
		service the needs of the domestic retail customer in Oman. Fifty-five of 
		these branches are located outside the Capital region. The bank’s branch 
		network stretches from Khasab in the North to Taqa in the South and from 
		Buraimi in the West to Sur in the East. We are committed to providing 
		our customers with the finest banking experience across the country.<br>
		<b><br>
		Either direct lending or assisting big borrowers to access money is your 
		forte. How far has BankMuscat succeeded in helping create small and 
		medium enterprises and building up an entrepreneurial class?</b><br>
		One of the most serious constraints the SME sector finds in most 
		countries is ready access to the finances that would help them move up 
		in terms of size/critical mass and consequently, the value chain. This 
		has also been reflected in the World Business Environment Survey, which 
		covers 4,000 firms across 54 countries. The SME sector has, by and 
		large, irrespective of country, cited inadequate access to finance as 
		its primary constraint to growth. <br>
		<br>
		We, however, have been providing financial solutions to the SME sector 
		in Oman for several years. More recently, we launched a comprehensive 
		suite of programme lending services focused on the needs of the SME 
		sector. <br>
		<br>
		We do not consider these services as merely an addition to the products 
		and services roster of the bank, but as our contribution to the valuable 
		efforts of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Manpower 
		and the Central Bank of Oman to develop and nurture the small and medium 
		scale sector in the country. <br>
		<b><br>
		When it comes to lending a helping hand to mega projects, your track 
		record seems to be good. What is your forecast for 2006 in terms of 
		lending?</b><br>
		We have built considerable expertise in Project Finance in the domestic 
		Omani market where we have been involved with almost all the large 
		ticket project finance transactions with a significant role in several 
		projects. With the increase in our equity, following the bank’s maiden 
		GDR issue, and growing ability to take on cross border exposure, we plan 
		to leverage on our project finance expertise in other GCC markets. We 
		already have cross border exposure in syndicated transactions, and are 
		looking to expand this activity further into primary top tier arranger 
		and syndication roles. <br>

		Among the various facets where BankMuscat has a presence such as 
		corporate banking, retail, investment banking, treasury, private banking 
		and asset management, where do you stand in each of these categories 
		vis-à-vis competition? What, according to you, is your weakest link and 
		what is the strongest one? In 2006, what kind of growth strategy you are 
		planning?</b><br>
		Today, BankMuscat is very much the leading bank in the Sultanate and has 
		a market share in excess of 35 per cent across each of its key business 
		lines. It would, therefore, not be right to try and identify which of 
		the business lines are stronger than the others. Each have their own 
		rightful position in the overall portfolio of our offerings and 
		contribute to their own potential to the Bank’s bottom-line.<br>
		<br>
		In 2006, the bank will continue to ride upon the strong foundations that 
		it has laid in the past and will continue to forge ahead on its path to 
		realise its ambition of becoming one of the foremost banks across the 
		region by the turn of the decade. It will also continue to ride on its 
		pillars of excellence and quality in everything it does and provide its 
		customers with an even more superior customer experience.<br>
		<br>
		Our growth strategy has traditionally spanned organic and inorganic 
		growth opportunities. The bank will continue to explore all quality 
		opportunities that come its way during the new year, both in Oman and 
		across the geographies that have an abiding interest in the GCC 
		countries. Whether this will be through BankMuscat or BankMuscat 
		International remains to be seen.<b><br>
		<br>
		In terms of innovative products, will BankMuscat surprise the financial 
		world this year?</b><br>
		I am afraid you will have to wait and see! The year 2006, as I mentioned 
		earlier, promises to be exciting for at least three key developments 
		that promise to impact the banking sector both directly and indirectly 
		in the Sultanate: It will be a watershed year with the WTO regulations 
		coming into play at a national level and the Basel II regulations being 
		implemented by the banking sector. To cap it all, year 2006 has begun 
		with the signing of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Oman and the 
		United States of America.<br>
		<br>
		While the Basel II regulations are essentially an issue that will impact 
		the banking sector alone, the WTO regulations and the FTA will have a 
		huge, overall impact. <br>
		<br>
		For, while they promise to help the country integrate much farther into 
		the global economy, in line with the vision of His Majesty, they are 
		also expected to result in the emergence of substantial opportunities 
		for the local industry to extend its competencies overseas. Finally, 
		they will also result in many more global organizations looking at the 
		Sultanate and its dominating youth market as a potential destination on 
		the global map. <br>
		<br>
		What challenges and opportunities that these three developments throw up 
		for the banking sector, and in turn, customers across the Sultanate, 
		remains to be seen. One thing, however, is certain: increased economic 
		spending will both directly and indirectly help the sector and this 
		indeed will result in leading players reaching out to woo discerning 
		customers all the more persistently during the year ahead. Whether this 
		will result in a slew of customer-focused initiatives or products and 
		services, remains to be seen.<b><br>
		<br>
		In pure numbers, what kind of growth percentage are you looking in 2006?</b><br>
		Historically, we have grown at close to 20 per cent over the past 10 to 
		15 years. However, I would not like to comment further on this at this 
		point in time. We shall, however, continue to grow on the strong 
		foundations laid during 2005 and the years that have preceded it, in our 
		quest to move ahead.<br>
		<b><br>
		What is your success rate in achieving the Omanization targets? Do you 
		find any problems in meeting the targets at any levels? If so, how are 
		you trying to overcome those areas?</b><br>
		Omanization is a key national objective. As the nation’s largest bank, 
		we have a duty to provide quality employment opportunities to the 
		talented youth of the country and Omanization ensures that each one of 
		us play our part in the process. However, that is not to say that we do 
		not have our fair share of expatriates working with us as well. Our 
		Omanization levels as on 30 October 2005 was in the region of 91.23 per 
		cent, the balance comprising talented professionals from the UK, 
		Australia, Canada, Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Kenya, Lebanon, Syria, India, 
		Sri Lanka and Pakistan. <br>
		<br>
		Every country, whether Oman, India or the United States, has room for 
		its fair share of talented professionals from overseas. These people 
		play a key role in bringing specialized skill sets to the table, which 
		are otherwise wanting. <br>
		In the context of Omanization, the expatriates play an additional role 
		of imparting knowledge and training to our people who are guided through 
		their formative years by strong in-house mentors. Without the presence 
		of strong talent at senior positions, many of our young people who start 
		work immediately after college may indeed consider going abroad. <br>
		<br>
		When we are on the verge of opening our national borders to 
		international companies, we cannot really close our doors to 
		international talent because of Omanization. Yes, the market will 
		choose, and providing right opportunities to our youth will continue to 
		be our priority, but in some fields we would need fresh expertise from 
		abroad. This trend is valid for people from Oman as well. Tomorrow, 
		these Omanis may indeed go abroad and play a meaningful role in the 
		international arena.</font></td>

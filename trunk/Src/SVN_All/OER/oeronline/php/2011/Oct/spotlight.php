				<b><font size="2">In spite of the unsettled political and 
				economic climate in some parts of the Middle East and North 
				Africa, the real estate sectors in the region have recovered 
				well from any effects of the global financial crisis. This has 
				had a positive spin-off effect on the Sultanate as well, as can 
				be seen from the spurt in both retail and commercial space 
				activities in the country</font></b><p align="justify" class="style13">
				<br>
				Oman’s real estate and construction sector is set to derive the 
				maximum benefits as the government is ramping up spending on 
				infrastructure and development. The current influx of 
				construction projects, combined with major projects in the 
				information technology (IT) segment, has ably positioned Oman in 
				a strong and steadfast position along with other emerging 
				economies. The Sultanate of Oman has a vibrant sector with 2.1 
				per cent growth and over RO1.2bn worth of construction projects 
				underway or in the planning stages, according to a recent report 
				from Business Monitor International, a leading business research 
				and intelligence firm.<br>
				<br>
				The BMI report also reveals the significant potential of Oman’s 
				infrastructure sector with a number of contracts having been 
				awarded in 2011 and substantial new investment planned. The 
				momentum in infrastructure sector is expected to bring in an 
				overall 5.06 per cent real growth towards the end of the year. 
				The confidence in the construction segment is backed by Oman’s 
				five year spending plan, which covers 2011 to 2015 and predicts 
				over RO30bn worth of spending with a 113 per cent increase. 
				Significantly, of this total figure, RO6bn will go to the oil 
				industry and RO3bn will be spent on property developments.<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Office space</font></b><br>
				<br>
				Demand for office space in the capital area has remained 
				relatively steady over the last 18 months, although the unrest 
				in the Sultanate at the start of the year has seen a marked 
				decline in demand recently. However, the majority of demand 
				remains for smaller spaces of up to 500 square metres, whilst 
				flexibility in office design is vital to cater for smaller space 
				occupiers.<br>
				<br>
				One of the key points in the report indicates that the vast 
				majority of office stock in Muscat is currently Grade B or C, 
				with a limited availability of Grade A space. Cluttons expects 
				that this will soon change as a number of large scale, Grade A 
				office developments are due for completion in the near future.<br>
				<br>
				Among Grade A office developments that are due to be released 
				onto the market during the year include the Al Rawaq building in 
				Qurum, Beach Plaza in Shatti Al Qurum, Saud Bahwan Plaza in 
				Ghubrah and the Tilal Complex in Bausher. In total, these 
				developments alone will add approximately 158,000 square metres 
				of Grade A office space to the market.<br>
				<br>
				Cluttons Oman, one of the well known realty firm in Oman 
				foresees rental values for office space continuing to soften as 
				new office space enters the market. The premium for Grade A 
				space in comparison to Grade B space in the same area ranges 
				from 12.5 per cent to 33 per cent. It is evident that the supply 
				of Grade A office space in the Muscat capital area will 
				accelerate significantly over the coming year. However, in an 
				increasingly competitive market, and with strong interest in 
				Grade A office space, many tenants appear unwilling to pay a 
				significant premium in comparison to the rental values for Grade 
				B space in the same area.<br>
				<br>
				The report signals the proposition that landlords of Grade A 
				office space will need to adopt pro-active leasing strategies in 
				order to secure tenants, such as initial rent-free periods or 
				stepped rents over the term of the lease. In addition, Cluttons 
				emphasizes that high quality, professional property management 
				will be vital in attracting and retaining tenants.<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Residential</font></b><br>
				<br>
				According to Savills Oman, the first half of 2011 saw healthy 
				and increased activity in the residential leasing sector. Demand 
				was sustained for all types of property, particularly villa 
				options within the new ITC developments. Rentals remained under 
				pressure to some degree owing to corporates generally tightening 
				their housing budget allowances. The move of many companies away 
				from the traditional “expatriate package” which included housing 
				allowance to an all in gross salary has resulted in tenants 
				becoming increasingly demanding in terms of value for money. 
				Values for most property types appear to have reached their 
				‘true levels’ and further declines from existing rates are not 
				predicted over the next quarter.<br>
				<br>
				Whilst medium level apartment rentals have held firm over the 
				quarter, there is likely to be some downward pressure throughout 
				the rest of the year owing to the completion of a significant 
				amount of new stock. With some larger companies developing their 
				own staff accommodation, release of formerly rented apartments 
				into the market could potentially result in an oversupply and a 
				consequential softening of rents, a report by Savills Oman 
				stated.<br>
				<br>
				The impact of the new Integrated Tourism Complexes, The Wave and 
				Muscat Hills Golf &amp; Country Club particularly has been 
				significant for the rental market. With both these developments 
				offering high quality housing options in managed communities, 
				rents consistent with those prevailing in more central areas 
				continue to be achievable and demand remains high.<br>
				<br>
				As the enhanced facilities of hotels, shopping and recreational 
				amenities are completed in both these developments it is 
				predicted that there will be healthy rental growth and values 
				will outstrip those of the central areas. Older housing in the 
				traditionally favoured areas that has not been upgraded to 
				modern day standards is now failing to rent quickly and vacancy 
				rates are climbing.<br>

				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Telecom sector</font></b><br>
				<br>
				Mobile penetration rates were 171 per cent at Q4 2010 with 
				4,606,133 subscribers by the end of December 2010. This 
				represents an 8 per cent growth rate from Q3 2010 which also saw 
				the Average Revenue Per User (APRU) increase to R0.17.810 per 
				month for Fixed Post Paid users, an increase of 8.6% against Q3 
				2010. Whilst these levels head towards the saturation points 
				experienced by other GCC countries, such levels of growth remain 
				good news for operators and their shareholders.<br>
				<br>
				Slow initial investment into fixed line technology has been 
				overshadowed by improved mobile technology, connectivity, 3G 
				technology and smartphones. Existing restrictions to VOIP 
				services such as Skype are anticipated to be relaxed within the 
				region. As such, the report indicates that operators will be 
				required to revise their pricing approach and be creative with 
				future data services that they offer.<br>
				<br>
				Combined with Government support and initiatives, which hope to 
				increase the ICT development and knowledge of end users, this 
				will be a key driver in continued growth along with guidance 
				from the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). As a 
				result, consideration is required to real estate strategy and 
				portfolio flexibility in order to drive future market position. 
				Operators are likely to adopt a more organic approach to their 
				wider real estate needs, supported by professional property 
				advisors. This will include appropriate estate management 
				services during network deployment such as site acquisition and 
				commercial tenancy agreement management. Furthermore, corporate 
				strategy is likely to see additional real estate requirements in 
				the form of retail outlets to improve customer 
				experience/service and office expansion/consolidation as a 
				result of previous growth or changes in market position.<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Hotel rooms to increase</font></b><br>
				<br>
				STR Global figures report the average occupancy rate for Muscat 
				hotels in 2010 as being 55.8 per cent. While a slight 
				improvement on 2009 performance, this figure is significantly 
				below the 67 per cent achieved in 2008 and 69 per cent in 2007. 
				Accordingly it is evident that the hotel sector in Muscat has 
				suffered from the global recession.<br>
				<br>
				The Ministry of Tourism figures for the Muscat capital area for 
				2010 show that supply stood at 95 hotels and serviced 
				apartments. The supply of hotel rooms in the capital is 
				currently dominated by the four and five star sector which 
				provides 51.7 per cent of hotel rooms and 48.6 per cent of hotel 
				beds. Despite some fluctuations, development in the number of 
				hotels and hotel rooms in the Sultanate has progressed at an 
				average rate of around 7 per cent per annum over the last five 
				years according to Ministry of Tourism figures. In comparison, 
				the average year on year growth rate between 2000 and 2005 was 
				12 per cent for the number of hotels and 11 per cent for the 
				number of hotel rooms. It is evident that the comparative rate 
				of hotel development in Oman has slowed from 2006 to 2010 in 
				comparison to 2000 to 2005.<br>
				Two areas in Muscat have, however, witnessed marked development. 
				Over the last two years alone, the Al Khuwair area has seen the 
				opening of the 4 star Platinum, City Seasons and Park Inn hotels 
				and the 2/3 star Ibis, Rotana, Samara and Tulip Inn hotels which 
				have added approximately 1,000 rooms to the area’s stock. In 
				addition, there are a large number of unbranded, owner-operated, 
				moderate to low standard hotel apartments being developed in the 
				central to western areas of Al Khuwair, Bausher, Ghubrah and 
				Azaiba over the past couple of years aimed primarily at the 
				budget market.<br>
				<br>
				Hotel projects that we have identified as having a moderate to 
				high chance of being built over the next five years would, in 
				our estimation, add 5,000 to 6,000 rooms to the 3 to 5 star 
				sector in the Muscat capital area: this compares to a total of 
				3,777 rooms in the 3 to 5 star sector in Muscat in 2010 and 
				equates to a potential average annual growth rate of 
				approximately 18 per cent to 21 per cent over the coming five 
				years. In comparison, it is evident that the number of hotel 
				guests is closely linked to the number of inbound tourists and 
				that these have both grown at an average annual rate of around 
				7% over the last 5 years.<br>
				<br>
				It would appear that the rate of growth of inbound tourism will 
				need to accelerate significantly from current levels just to 
				maintain average occupancy levels as the projected pipeline of 
				hotels comes into the market.<p align="justify" class="style13">

				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">American hardwoods</font></b><br>
				<br>
				Oman has witnessed an increasing demand for American hardwoods 
				amidst stable real estate growth, which marks an important 
				turning point as customers, manufacturers and other industry 
				players become active again. Positioning itself as a growing 
				market for American hardwoods in the Middle East and North 
				African (MENA) region, Oman saw over $93,000 worth of imports 
				entering the country directly from the US during the first half 
				of 2011, according to a statement issued by the American 
				Hardwood Export Council (AHEC), the leading international trade 
				association for the American hardwood industry.<br>
				<br>
				The value of American hardwood lumber shipped to the MENA region 
				from January to June 2011 increased by 1.3 per cent over the 
				same six months of last year and reached a total of $24.35mn. In 
				addition, the first two quarters have seen exports of US 
				hardwood veneers to the MENA region increase by 15 per cent to 
				$10.66mn, while exports of flooring increased by 5 per cent to 
				$603,217 and logs by 4 per cent to $14.25mn. The Omani 
				construction industry, which was valued at $3.7bn in 2010, is 
				expected to key in more growth and development via the influx of 
				major projects in the construction and other segments. The 
				American hardwood industry is confident that this will lead to 
				even greater demand for US hardwoods in the coming months and 
				years.<br>

				<b>GLOREI</b><br>
				<b>Building the nation</b><br>
				Global Omani Development &amp; Investment Company GLOREI is a 
				leading real estate developer in Oman. It is a closed 
				shareholding company established in 2008, with a paid capital of 
				RO43.5mn. In terms of paid-up capital, GLOREI is the largest 
				real estate development company in the country.<br>
				<br>
				GLOREI started the development of a five-star hotel - Shaza 
				Muscat Hotel which is coming up next to the Tilal Al Khuwair 
				complex in the Al Khuwair area of Muscat. It is about 16 km away 
				both from the Muscat International Airport and the Central 
				Business District (CBD) in Greater Muttrah. The project is 
				built-up on a stretch of land of about 12,566sqm, and is being 
				developed by GLOREI along with its strategic partners. This 
				property will be operated by one of the well-known international 
				hotel brands, maintaining very high standards in hospitality. It 
				will strive to provide exclusive and modern services and 
				facilities which will be matching the needs of the target 
				segments of society who seek privacy and distinction.<br>
				<br>
				In addition, it has also established a new project in Oman with 
				full services, the modern and sophisticated Business Centre (Maktabi 
				Al Khuwair) which located in the heart of the city of Muscat in 
				the prestigious business district and diplomatic Area.<br>
				<br>
				The business centre provides premium serviced office space with 
				managed facilities on a short, medium, or long-term basis. The 
				office space is fully furnished, equipped with desks, chairs, 
				telephones and internet connectivity. The centre also provides 
				assistance to the tenants in administering the affairs of their 
				rented offices, including the provision of essential secretarial 
				support.<br>
				<br>
				Another project under construction is an environmentally 
				friendly commercial project – Maktabi Al Wattayyah – which is 
				located in Wattayyah and is placed right between the traditional 
				commercial hub Ruwi and the new commercial area Al Khuwair. Its 
				proximity to major residential and other commercial areas plus a 
				20 km drive to the Muscat International Airport makes Watiyah a 
				preferred location for offices. Addressing different needs of 
				clients, GLOREI will offer options for end users in terms of 
				ownership and leasing. Construction for this project is underway 
				and the company’s offices could be contacted for more 
				information on leasing or buying office spaces.<br>
				<br>
				The first project of the company is to develop and own an 
				integrated mix-use real estate project to include residential, 
				commercial and hotel units in Wilayat Baushar which will provide 
				the residents with services and facilities that fit with the 
				requirements of modern life style and commensurate with the 
				targeted segments in the community. GLOREI has also contributed 
				to the establishment of Omani integrated logistics company, an 
				Omani closed joint stock company with a group of investors from 
				within and outside the Sultanate. The company has commenced its 
				operations in the year 2009 providing internal logistics

				<b>Cluttons in Oman – upgrading its property and facilities 
				management software to keep pace with market demand</b><br>
				<br>
				Following the boom years in Oman, 2006 -2008 the number and 
				quality of projects being delivered has changed dramatically. 
				Many projects are now of a size and scale that can no longer be 
				managed by the usual locally adopted methods of occasional 
				visits by inexperienced technicians and an on-site caretaker. 
				Tenants are demanding higher standards and there is now an 
				emerging two tier market with strong demand for quality well 
				managed buildings but with poorer unmanaged buildings remaining 
				empty. This is driving demand for experienced property 
				management companies.<br>
				<br>
				Cluttons has recently upgraded its software to meet such 
				changing market conditions, and now offers an advanced automated 
				property and facilities management package: TRAMPS. This system 
				integrates tenant details, lease details and the asset register 
				within the helpdesk functions. This market leading software has 
				been developed by TRACE solutions for the demanding British 
				market and ensures that a building can be optimally managed to 
				deliver maximum benefits to the tenants and owner.<br>
				<br>
				The help desk function records and analyses faults and 
				complaints, and ensures service personnel comply with service 
				level agreements and key performance indicators. The benefits of 
				this means that the owner gets better reports, the tenants get 
				better service and contractor performance can be better 
				monitored.<br>
				<br>
				The asset register is a record of all plant, equipment and 
				fixtures. It is automatically integrated with the helpdesk, and 
				also generates planned preventive maintenance programmes. These 
				features enable health history tracking and it ensures 100% 
				uptime and the extended life of the asset as well as the 
				property as a whole.<br>
				<br>
				The system offers a secure and systematic approach to property 
				accounting operated by experienced and qualified professional 
				staff operating to international standards. Full automation 
				means that critical dates are not missed. <br>
				<br>
				The Cluttons team in Oman is highly experienced in managing a 
				wide range of properties, from large residential, commercial, 
				office, retail to mixed-use developments. The team is driven by 
				a desire to offer optimum client service, and by using this 
				software, can improve the bottom line of building owners by 
				attracting high levels of occupancy and extending the life of 
				the equipment and building. <br>

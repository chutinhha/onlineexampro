				first thing that strikes you about Deepak Kumar Srivastava, 
				financial controller, Oman LNG is his serenity and gentle 
				demeanour. An alumni of Indian Institute of Management, 
				Ahmedabad, he has worked across sectors and geographies over a 
				35 year career. Speaking about managerial must haves he says, 
				“Self management is important, unless you manage yourself well 
				you cannot lead others. Second, one needs to be persistent as 
				they say, ‘Tough times do not last but tough people do.’ 
				Knowledge in your chosen field is of paramount importance as is 
				discipline, unless one is an artist or a scientist. Finally, 
				integrity is important to succeed in the long run. One may get 
				away with dishonesty for a short while, but it is unsustainable 
				over a period of time.”<br>
				<br>
				Apart from these he believes that while leading a team with 
				people of varying knowledge levels, background and skills one 
				needs to have empathy for them. “You can get the best out of 
				your colleagues if they have trust in you, they will take risks 
				if they are sure that you will stand by them.”<br>
				<br>
				Every morning when he walks into office he makes sure to spend 
				five to ten minutes speaking to his team members, this can 
				either be a casual conversation or a peek into something that 
				they want to do. This is followed by checking mails, attending 
				to priority work followed by doing regular jobs like financial 
				planning, making payments or signing cheques and supervisory 
				work. <br>
				<br>
				<font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Influencing factors</b></font><br>
				<br>
				The two people who have left an indelible imprint on Srivastava 
				are Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of India’s freedom struggle and 
				Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group. Though these two leaders 
				represent different era’s and generations he counts them as his 
				guiding lights. If he has learnt the values of truth and courage 
				from Gandhi, he admires Tata for his integrity, self discipline 
				and risk taking ability. Having started his career with Tata 
				Motors, he has had a chance to see the company from close 
				quarters. “They inculcate a professional value system across the 
				organisation. They want to be industry leaders (e.g. Tata Steel, 
				Tata Tea, Tata Motors) if they are not able to achieve this then 
				they are ready to walk out of the sector as they have done in 
				mining and textiles. Over my professional life I have nurtured 
				the seeds that were planted during my stint with the company.”<br>
				<br>
				A constant quest for learning has been a defining trait of 
				Srivastava’s career. Apart from an MBA, his other qualifications 
				include a CIMA from the Chartered Institute of Mangement 
				Accountants, UK; FCCA from the Association of Chartered 
				Certified Accountants, UK; CIA from the Institute of Internal 
				Auditors, USA and CISA from the ISACA, US. In 2000 he acquired 
				an ACCA with IAS stream and has since become a Fellow member. In 
				an effort to share his knowledge, he gives lectures regularly at 
				ACCA’s Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programmes and 
				various other forums in the Middle East.<br>
				<br>
				Despite having achieved various laurels educationally and 
				professionally, Srivastava is in no mood to hang his boots yet. 
				“The best is yet to come. I want to do two things in life one, 
				become an independent director and second join the audit 
				committee of companies.” And if his past record is any 
				indication one can rest assured that he will get there sooner 
				rather than later. <br>

				The year 2010 was the closing year of the 7th Five Year 
				Development Plan and the gateway to the 8th Five Year 
				Development Plan. The 7th Plan has performed remarkably well in 
				spite of the global financial stress mid-way during the plan 
				period. The economy achieved an average GDP growth at current 
				prices of 13 per cent per annum and at constant prices of 6.3 
				per cent per annum. The oil and gas sector recorded a GDP growth 
				at current prices of 11.2 per cent per annum. Non-oil activities 
				registered a GDP growth at current prices of 14.6 per cent per 
				annum. Industrial activities accounted for the highest growth, 
				at current prices of 18 per cent per annum and within this the 
				construction sector recorded a growth of 22.7 per cent. The 
				total additional employment opportunities for the national work 
				force touched 177,000 during the seventh plan. <br>

				<br>
				Total assets of commercial banks in the country increased by 
				10.2 per cent to RO15,647.5mn in December 2010 from RO14,198.9mn 
				in December 2009. Total outstanding credit rose by nine per cent 
				to RO10,724.3mn at the end of December 2010 from RO9,834.4mn at 
				the close of December 2009. Investments of commercial banks in 
				domestic and foreign securities decreased by 29 per cent to 
				RO1,185.2mn from RO1,670.7mn a year ago. Investments of 
				commercial banks in foreign securities increased to RO206.9mn

				Oman stood at RO1,520.3 at the end of December 2010 as compared 
				to RO779.4mn at the end of December 2009.<br>
				<br>
				Aggregate deposits of commercial banks as at the end of December 
				2010 increased by 14.6 per cent to RO10,516.8mn from RO9,175.6mn 
				over the 12-month period from December 2009. Private sector

				December 2010 from RO 6,541.5mn a year ago. Government deposits 
				rose by 25.5 per cent to RO2,301.2mn, and deposits of public 
				enterprises rose by 19.3 per cent to RO864.2mn during the same 
				period.<br>
				<br>
				Broad money (M2) increased by 11.3 per cent to RO8,784.8mn in 
				December 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Money supply 
				as represented by narrow money (M1) comprising currency held by 
				the public and local currency demand deposits expanded by 21.6 
				per cent over the 12-month period ending in December 2010 to 
				reach RO2,875.9mn. Quasi money (comprising Rial Omani savings

				There was a marked increase in foreign direct investment from 
				RO2,199mn in the first year of the seventh plan to RO5,029 in 
				2009. The average daily production of oil has increased by 7.4 
				per cent from 757,000 barrels per day in 2008 to 813,000 barrels 
				per day in 2009. The total oil production during the first 10

				compared to the same period of the previous year. The country’s 
				oil production stood at 875,000 barrels per day at the end of 
				November 2010 and the output is set to reach 900,000 barrels per 
				day by the end of 2011. These accomplishments contributed to the 
				growth of the national economy during the last five years. They 
				will serve as an environment in which the economy will continue 
				to grow and flourish during the 8th Five-Year Plan.<br>

				The Muscat Securities Market became the third best performing 
				bourse in the Gulf region with 6.1 per cent gain in general

				<br>
				The government has been encouraging family-owned businesses in 
				Oman to go public. As part of the process of economic inclusion 
				and diversification, the government is studying the possibility 
				of reducing the ratio that family-owned businesses need to offer 
				to go public, from 40 per cent to 25 per cent. When more 
				companies go public, the dynamism of the market is set to 
				increase. The investment climate has improved significantly in 
				Oman. The country provides physical, industrial and 
				technological infrastructure and improved incentives.<br>
				<br>
				New amendments introduced to attract foreign direct investments 
				allow foreigners 100 per cent participation and reduces the 
				corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 12 per cent. This is one 
				of the lowest corporate tax rates in the region. At the close of 
				the seventh plan in 2010, the volume of investments touched 
				RO14.1bn, an increase of 110 per cent compared to the volume of 
				investments during the sixth plan period.<br>

				<br>
				<span class="style16"><strong>THE METHODOLOGY</strong></span><br>
				<br>
				We have employed growth and sustainability as parameters for the 
				ranking of commercial banks in Oman. The Banks Ranking Model was 
				done among the leading banks which include Bank Muscat, National 
				Bank of Oman, Oman Arab Bank, Bank Dhofar, Oman international 
				Bank and Ahli Bank. We have taken the period from 2007 to 2010 
				to rank them on the set parameters of growth and sustainability. 
				For the current year, Ahli Bank which saw the transition from 
				housing bank to commercial bank became a part of the final 
				ranking process. Still, the newly established Bank Sohar has 
				been excluded due to the non-availability of data required as 
				per our ranking methodology. <br>
				<br>
				In case of a tie in ranks between two banks, we have considered 
				the size of the bank to decide on the final ranking. The bank 
				with the bigger size of assets would be ranked higher as 
				compared to the smaller bank.<br>
				<br>
				The data were sourced from the published financial statements of 
				the Banks, CBO reports and other published reports. Ranking 
				based on growth is done by calculating the compounded annual 
				growth rate (CAGR) of Gross loans, Customer Deposits, Fee 
				Income, Operating Profit, Networth and Net Profit from 2007 to 
				2010. In our ranking model, the Operating profit is calculated 
				by subtracting total operating income with the total expenses 
				(excluding depreciation costs). Ranking on sustainability was 
				done by calculating the four-year average of three key factors 
				like Asset Quality, Productivity and Efficiency. <br>
				<br>
				Asset Quality was ranked based on Non Performing Assets to the 
				Gross Loans (NPA/GL) ratio and the overall loan provisions to 
				non-performing assets (Provision Coverage ratio). The 
				Productivity is ranked based on operating profit of the bank to 
				its branches and employees.<br>
				Finally, the Efficiency factor considers Net interest margins 
				(Net Interest Income/average interest bearing assets), Cost to 
				Income ratio, Return on Average Assets and Return on Average 
				Equity. For the calculation of Cost to Income ratio, we have 
				excluded the depreciation expenses. <br>

						<span class="style16">How did the banking sector in the 
				Sultanate perform in the last one year (2009-10)?<br></span>
						</strong><br>Reflecting recovery of the Omani economy, total bank credit 
				during 2010 was higher at nine per cent compared to 6.2 per cent 
				in 2009. While credit to the public enterprises rose by 59.6 per 
				cent, the same for private sector increased by 6.2 per cent in 
				2010. Credit growth to private sector may be seen in the context 
				of sluggish growth of the non-hydrocarbon sector in 2010. 
				Aggregate deposits with the commercial banks, which grew by 14.6 
				per cent in 2010, were sufficient to support the credit growth. 
				Liquidity condition was comfortable throughout the year as 
				evident from the large roll over of CBO CDs in the weekly 
				auctions. Reflecting comfortable liquidity conditions, both rial 
				Omani deposits and lending rates softened in 2010. While average 
				rial Omani deposit rate declined from 2.23 per cent in December 
				2009 to 1.69 per cent in December 2010, the rial Omani lending 
				rate moved downward from 7.44 per cent to 6.83 per cent during 
				the same period. Commercial banks enjoyed an interest rate 
				spread of 5.1 per cent in 2010 compared to 5.2 per cent in the 
				previous year. Profits earned by commercial banks stood higher 
				at RO249.1mn in 2010 (provisional) compared to RO190.8mn in 
				2009. The banking system remained resilient with capital 
				adequacy ratio being around 15 per cent at the end of 2010 as 
				against the statutory requirement of 12 per cent prescribed by 
				the CBO.<br><span class="style16"><strong><br>What are the regulatory measures being taken by the Central Bank 
				of Oman to strengthen the banking sector in the Sultanate?</strong><br>
						</span><br>Oman’s 
				banking sector continued to remain resilient during the recent 
				years despite adverse international developments. Keeping in 
				view the outcome of the recent global financial crisis and 
				consequent financial sector reforms suggested by the global 
				standard-setting bodies, the CBO has already initiated a number 
				of regulatory and supervisory measures to improve efficiency of 
				the country’s banking sector. Mention may be made about the 
				minimum regulatory capital, which was recently raised from 10 
				per cent of the risk-weighted assets to 12 per cent, to be 
				achieved by the end of 2010. The risk-based supervision, which 
				has been introduced recently on a pilot basis, would cover the 
				entire banking system by 2012. Moreover, we are currently 
				working to develop a set of macro-prudential indicators to 
				assess the vulnerability of the financial system in Oman. As 
				financial stability has emerged as a global problem, preliminary 
				work has already been done to set up a financial stability unit 
				within the CBO for macro-prudential supervision of the banking 
				system and produce the financial stability report in due course.

						<span class="style16">How is the macro-economic 
				situation in Oman and how is it impacting the banking sector in
						<br>the Sultanate?<br></span><br></strong>Amidst global uncertainties, the Omani economy 
				witnessed significant turnaround in GDP growth in 2010, mostly 
				driven by recovery in crude oil prices in the international 
				markets. Sustained domestic demand, supported by accommodative 
				fiscal and monetary policies, also contributed to the economic 
				recovery.<br><br>According to the latest data available from the Ministry of 
				National Economy, the Sultanate’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
				at current prices grew by 28.3 per cent during the first three 
				quarters of 2010 in contrast to a decline of 27.4 per cent in 
				the corresponding period of 2009. While nominal GDP emanating 
				from the hydrocarbon sector registered a robust growth of 54.2 
				per cent, the same from non-petroleum activities witnessed a 
				growth of 11.4 per cent up to September 2010. The daily average 
				production of crude oil during 2010 was 865,000 barrels per day 
				– an increase of 6.4 per cent over 813,000 barrels per day in 
				the previous year. Omani crude oil fetched an average price of 
				$76.64 per barrel in 2010, which was 35.2 per cent higher than 
				$56.67 per barrel realised in 2009. As a result, pressures on 
				overall fiscal balance as well as on external current account 
				were reduced. The external current account is likely to witness 
				a surplus in 2010 as against a small deficit in 2009. The 
				banking sector is consolidating its position amidst broad-based 
				economic recovery.<br><br><br><span class="style16"><strong>There have been concerns about 
				inflation. Is the Central Bank taking any measures to control 
				inflation?<br><br></strong></span>Price situation in Oman remained, by and large, 
				under control with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 
				Sultanate rising by 3.3 per cent on an average basis. However, 
				on a point-to-point basis, the inflation rate accelerated to 4.2 
				per cent by the end of 2010 compared to 0.9 per cent a year ago. 
				This could be attributed partly to sustained domestic demand and 
				more importantly to sharp increase in prices of essential 
				commodities in the international markets. The CBO is closely 
				monitoring the price situation in the domestic and global 
				markets and is prepared to take appropriate actions during the 
				course of 2011 if the international price situation turns 
				adverse and its impact is felt in the domestic market.<br>
						<span class="style16"><strong><br>How do you see the banking sector’s performance this year and 
				can we expect any new bank to start operations in the Sultanate 
				soon?</strong></span><br><br>The overall macroeconomic outlook for Oman, which turned 
				positive in 2010, is expected to gather momentum in 2011. 
				Commercial banks may experience pick up in credit demand. As the 
				deposit growth was impressive in 2010 and the liquidity 
				condition continued to remain comfortable, commercial banks may 
				not find it difficult to meet all genuine credit demands of the 
				economy. We have given permission for one new commercial bank (Izz 
				Bank) to start operation in Oman. The new bank is in the process 
				of complying with the regulatory requirements. As soon as it 
				completes the process, it may start its operations.<br><br><br>

						</b>maintains its positions as the No. 1 Bank in the 
				Sultanate for the second year in running on the Best Banks 
				survey<br><br>Strong fundamentals and prudent risk management practices 
				enabled BankDhofar to witness appreciable growth in most of its 
				financial indicators in the year 2010, with total assets 
				recording a sustainable growth of 10.3 per cent from RO1,509.3mn 
				at the end of December 2009 to reach RO1,664.3mn in 2010. The

				deposits mobilised by the bank achieved an impressive growth of 
				13.5 per cent. <br><br>Oman’s economy and its banking sector were relatively unaffected 
				by the continuing economic and global crisis. However, due to 
				the slowdown in economic activities particularly in the private 
				sector, the credit off take for the banks had been on a low keel 
				throughout the year. Against this backdrop, the Wholesale 
				Banking Group (WBG) which caters to the needs of the corporate 
				clientele performed reasonably well.<br><br>The WBG consists of the following departments: (i) Large 
				Corporate Banking Department (ii) Project Finance &amp; Syndications 
				Department (iii) Mid segment (Corporate) Department (iv) 
				Remedial &amp; MIS and (v) Trade Finance Sales.<br><br>The rationale behind this set up is to focus on different 
				segments of businesses and provide full range of commercial and 
				corporate banking services under a single umbrella.<br><br>Large Corporate Banking plays a vital role in WBG by 
				concentrating on top- end customers with large exposures. The 
				customer base also spans across various industries which 
				includes trading, manufacturing, services and contracting. The 
				needs of these high-end customers are varied and require 
				constant interaction to understand their working capital 
				requirements. The bank has introduced customer segmentation 
				based on their balance sheet turnover/quantum of bank’s credit 
				exposure for focused customer service.<br><br>Experienced and dedicated account relationship managers are 
				assigned to individual corporate clients for quick and seamless 
				service as a single point of contact. The emphasis is on the 
				development of tailor-made financial solutions that are suited 
				to the particular needs of the customers.<br><br>In the context of continuing uncertainties in global financial 
				markets and macroeconomic environment, growth in the bank’s 
				asset portfolio in this segment was cautiously undertaken during 
				the year. The department funded several large contracts and 
				arranged a club deal with a local bank for raising $50mn for an 
				industrial group.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>Project finance

				infrastructural projects including the projects of Oman India 
				Fertilizer Company, Sohar Aluminum, Oman LNG, Oman Gas, Salalah 
				Port, Oman Refinery (expansion), Octal Petrochemicals and other 
				six power and water projects. <br><br>The bank has in place the technical capability to independently 
				lead-arrange funds for medium sized ventures and has a strategic 
				tie-up with regional and international banks for the purpose of 
				ensuring full participation. During the latter half of 2010, the 
				department successfully arranged a $175mn syndicated loan for a 
				corporate from a few international and regional banks which 
				showcased its ability in this area.<br><br>Realising the importance of the Small and Medium enterprises (SME) 
				to the development of a vibrant economy, BankDhofar has taken 
				strategic initiatives to further the development of SMEs in the 
				country. The bank has a dedicated division – Mid Sector 
				Corporate Banking Department – which caters to this particular 
				segment. The Mid Sector Corporate Banking Department is geared 
				to meet the financial requirements ranging from RO100,000 to 
				RO5mn. The Business Banking unit which forms part of the Mid 
				Sector Corporate focuses on the specific needs of the smaller 
				businesses within the segment with financial needs aggregating 
				up to RO250,000.<br><br>During 2010, the department had given emphasis to maintaining 
				and improving the quality of its portfolio. The bank was able to 
				nurture some troubled assets in the real estate sector through 
				innovative solutions and strong recovery efforts. Over a longer 
				term, this particular segment is expected to witness growth with 
				the growth of the country’s economy.<br><br>
						<span class="style16"><strong>Distribution network<br>
						</strong></span><br>Consumer Banking Division (CBD) of BankDhofar continued its 
				focus on providing value-added products and services to the 
				customers. The bank continued its growth and expansion strategy 
				in 2010, strengthening its distribution channels with the 
				addition of more branches, ATMs, CDMs and Bill Payment Machines 
				(BPMs). The year 2010 saw the addition of two new branches at 
				Yanqul and Mudhaibi, relocation of one branch at Al-Mintrib, and 
				renovation of Suwaiq branch. The year ended with 56 branches, 
				128 ATMs, CDMs and Bill Payment Machines.<br><br>Despite the tough competition on low-cost deposit witnessed in 
				the market during the year, Al Heson savings scheme captured 
				sensible growth. The scheme offered competitive prizes to 
				customers. The Al Heson savings scheme is one of the most 
				popular savings schemes in the market with its unique 
				proposition which gives customers the opportunity to open an 
				account, save and get the chance to win every week. As part of 
				the centralisation strategy, the bank allocated the operations

				Department in order to allow retail banking to focus on growing 
				the card business and expanding the credit cards range.<br><br>In 2010 the Card Business Centre introduced the chip on debit 
				cards. The chip technology has introduced many new powerful 
				features to strengthen and improve security in the payment 
				industry. With chip technology and the introduction of PIN, 
				issuers and Acquirers are increasingly protected from skimming, 
				counterfeit and lost and stolen fraud.<br><br>The housing loans portfolio growth remained positive in 2010 in 
				terms of new customers as well as outstandings. The bank’s 
				housing loan product was further enhanced with reduction in 
				interest rate. The product is very competitive in the market as 
				it offers a low monthly installment and low insurance.<br><br>The bank focused on Small &amp; Medium Enterprise (SME) banking to 
				support growth of the segment, as it impacts the economy in a 
				large way and also creates employment opportunities for the 
				nationals. The bank continued building-up the portfolio during 
				the year in net lending and number of customers.<br><br>The bank’s keen perception of customer requirements has enabled 
				it to understand and extend products and services in line with 
				the current and emerging needs, establishing high quality and 
				standards in customer satisfaction.<br><br>In 2010, the Banks Quality Assurance system started taking its 
				current shape. As a part of this system, feedback and complaints 
				which are not resolved immediately are acknowledged and the 
				customer is given a reference number for follow-up. The bank was 
				able to resolve 92 per cent of complaints within 15 working 
				days. The bank has initiated many programmes to enhance customer 
				service, from awareness presentations, surveys, training 
				courses, providing MIS to the management committee to assist 
				them. The bank has planned several other programmes in 2011 to 
				further strengthen the customer experience. <br><br>
						<span class="style16"><strong>E-banking channels<br>
						</strong></span><br>Following the centralisation of the e-Banking unit in 2009 to 
				oversee all electronic channels, the unit now oversees the 
				service activities of ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines, Phone 
				Banking, SMS Banking, Internet Banking and the Call Centre. The 
				bank’s 24-hour Call Centre, handles customer requests and 
				enquiries for Internet Banking and other electronic channels. 
				Call Centre services were improved through enhanced training and 
				introduction of service monitoring tools. The Call Centre 
				strength was increased to 17 call agents under a manager. To 
				ensure customer satisfaction, a strict quality control procedure 
				has been implemented.<br>In addition, the Call Centre staff is put through periodic 
				training programmes on products and customer handling skills. 
				The unit also integrated Internet Banking with Finacle and 
				introduced real time SMS alerts. The number of Internet Banking 
				registrations increased by over 220 per cent.<br><br>

						<br><b>BankMuscat</b> has scaled up operations both locally and regionally 
				to position itself as a leading bank in the GCC<br><br>Despite the challenging global economic and financial situation 
				in 2010, the key business lines of BankMuscat recorded a healthy 
				performance. The bank achieved a net profit of RO101.6mn for the 
				year ended on December 31, 2010 as against RO73.7mn reported in 
				2009, an increase of 37.8 per cent. Net interest income 
				increased by 7.3 per cent from RO174.4mn in 2009 to RO187.2mn in 
				2010 supported by improvement in net interest margin and asset 
				growth. Non-interest income was RO78.3mn in 2010 as against 
				RO116.7mn (including a gain on sale of HDFC investment) in 2009. 
				Non-interest income was higher by 22 per cent compared to the 
				year 2009, excluding the gain on HDFC Bank investment and 
				realised losses on available-for-sale investment.<br><br>Operating expenses for the year ended on December 31, 2010 was 
				RO102.9mn, an increase of 25.3 per cent as compared to 2009. 
				Says AbdulRazak Ali Issa, chief executive, BankMuscat, “The 
				increase in operating expense was attributable to the long-term 
				vision and strategy to develop the banking infrastructure by way 
				of technology investments, expansion of business and delivery 
				channel network to provide better service and maintain the 
				leadership position.” The cost to income ratio for the year 2010 
				was 38.7 per cent as compared to 35.6 per cent for the year 
				2009, excluding the gain on HDFC Bank’s investment.<br>The bank’s net loans and advances portfolio grew by RO169mn or 
				4.4 per cent to RO4,008mn as on December 31, 2010 compared to 
				RO3,838mn in 2009. Customer deposits in 2010 was RO3,527mn as 
				compared to RO3,068mn in 2009, an increase of RO14.9 per cent, 
				mainly due to an increase in demand deposits and savings 
				deposits as the bank continued its efforts to mobilise low-cost 
				deposits. <br><br>BankMuscat’s savings deposits grew by 12.8 per cent from RO817mn 
				in 2009 to RO922mn in 2010 and demand deposits grew by 28.1 per 
				cent from RO964mn in 2009 to RO1,235mn by the end of December 
				2010.<br><br>The return on average assets improved from 1.2 per cent in 2009 
				to 1.74 per cent in 2010. The return on average equity was 14.6 
				per cent in 2010 as compared to 10.9 per cent in 2009. <br><br>The basic earnings per share was RO0.075 in 2010 as against 
				RO0.068 in 2009. The bank’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.4 
				per cent as on December 31, 2010 before the appropriation for 
				dividend for the year 2010 against the minimum required level of 
				12 per cent by the Central Bank of Oman. For 2010, the bank made 
				a payout of 40 per cent dividend, 25 per cent in the form of 
				cash and 15 per cent in the form of bonus shares.<br><br>
						<span class="style16"><strong>Retail thrust </strong>
						</span><br><br>On the retail front, the bank’s products and services enjoy high 
				acceptance levels. Says <b>AbdulRazak</b>, “BankMuscat achieved its 
				vision of reaching every household in the country and exceeded 
				the one million satisfied customer base in 2010. The bank 
				focused on product cross-selling opportunities and the sizeable 
				‘unbanked market’ where over 50 per cent of the Sultanate’s 
				population is below 19 years.” The bank was well positioned to 
				leverage the large network of branches and other delivery 
				channels to target the growth potential and cross-sell 
				opportunities. <br><br>“The Sultanate of Oman is one of the pioneers in project 
				financing, particularly in the power &amp; water, oil &amp; gas, ports, 
				telecom and petrochemicals sectors. With oil prices at 
				favourable levels, the government’s agenda has been to focus on 
				infrastructure, industry (particularly metals) and tourism 
				sectors. BankMuscat has been tracking projects in metals and 
				petrochemicals – aluminium, steel and downstream petrochemicals 
				in Sohar which have the potential to expand from primary levels 
				to downstream activity,” says AbdulRazak. <br><br>The bank has been at the forefront in the financing of these 
				projects. The bank continues to lay emphasis in this area and 
				expects to play a leading role in meeting the financing 
				requirements of these projects. <br><br>BankMuscat is committed to offering banking convenience at the 
				doorstep of customers. The bank has the largest network of 130 
				branches, 386 ATMs, 131 CDMs and 4,500 PoS terminals spread 
				across the Sultanate. The Bank lays emphasis on the use of 
				technology - increased automation and facilitation of 
				transactions through mobile banking and ATMs - to enhance 
				operational efficiency and growth prospects.<br><br>
						<span class="style16"><strong>All round development 
						</strong></span><br><br>The bank is very much focused on enhancement of technology to 
				deliver higher levels of customer service. This ranges from 
				ensuring that its platforms are up-to-date for service and risk 
				delivery, while offering flexibility in services to ensure that 
				the bank operates a “straight through processing” environment, 
				to allow speedier and efficient service delivery.<br><br>The bank is a great votary of people’s development. Key people 
				development initiatives launched by the bank in 2010 include 
				6,021 learning opportunities provided by the Learning &amp; 
				Development Centre through 518 courses. The bank organised 
				Leadership Development programmes in collaboration with IMD, 
				Switzerland, Harvard Law School and The Achievement Centre, 
				Canada. The bank registered 152 staff for various professional 
				certifications and 44 of them successfully completed the 
				studies. The bank provided funding and study leave under the 
				Educational Assistance Scheme for 482 employees – 120 of whom 
				completed the studies.<br><br>In recognition of the benchmark HR practices, BankMuscat 
				achieved a spectacular global first, winning the prestigious 
				Level 3 People Capability Maturity Model (PCMM) certification by 
				Carnegie Melon University, USA. ankMuscat also won Asia’s Best 
				Employer Brand Award. The Bank was honoured by the Ministry of 
				Manpower for outstanding achievement in Omanisation, which 
				presently stands at 92 per cent.<br><br><span class="style16">
						<strong>Looking ahead</strong></span><br><br>The 8th Five-Year-Plan beginning in 2011 augurs well for Oman 
				with an estimated outlay of RO30bn, including RO6bn for the oil 
				industry. The opportunities identified by the bank include 
				significant infrastructure development which is expected to 
				contribute to the banking sector’s growth. The bank views the 
				industrial development of Oman as a strategic opportunity, 
				especially in Sohar, Salalah and Duqm. Expansion in the Gulf 
				Co-operation Council (GCC) countries is among the priorities in 
				view of the bank’s direct and indirect presence in all the six 
				states.<br><br>Says <b>AbdulRazak</b>, “BankMuscat is well positioned to leverage the 
				large network of branches and other delivery channels to target 
				the growth potential and other opportunities. The focus will be 
				on fee-based income by scaling up businesses such as investment 
				banking, asset management, private banking and cards.” The bank 
				is also set to leverage on investments in new technology and 
				state-of-the-art head office building to further increase 
				efficiency, improve customer service and support growth plan.
						<br><br>The year 2011 will be a period of increasing competition for the 
				banking sector with emphasis on competitive channels and new 
				products to cater to the various new and growing sectors.<br>

						<br><b>Ahli Bank</b> has grown steadily by pursuing a two- pronged strategy 
				of improving returns and laying the foundation for future growth<br>
						<br>Ahli Bank has seen a steady evolution over the last three years 
				– the year 2008 was a year which saw investment in resources, 
				branding, systems and products; the branch network and business 
				grew in 2009 while in 2010 the bank focussed on future expansion 
				and return on capital.<br><br>Says <b>AbdulAziz al Balushi</b>, CEO, Ahli Bank, “In 2011 we will 
				follow a policy of balanced growth and investment with prudent 
				balance sheet management. The bank will enhance profitability 
				ratios and the quality of its customer service.” <br><br>
						<span class="style16"><strong>Posting good numbers</strong></span>
						<br><br>The banking sector experienced a challenging environment in 
				2010. Despite the limitations imposed by the external 
				environment, Ahli Bank continued to grow and had a satisfactory 
				business and performance in 2010. The bank’s customer deposits 
				grew by 35 per cent in line with its strategy to build a stable 
				low cost deposit base. A loan growth of over 48 per cent was 
				managed with an eye on risk management. Not only did the loan 
				book grow but it continues to be of a very high quality as 
				reflected in the banks NPL ratio of 0.31 per cent.<br><br>The bank’s earnings per share (EPS) rose to 19.8bzs in 2010 from 
				12bzs during 2009. Keeping in view the current market condition 
				and the Central Bank of Oman’s mandated RO100mn share capital 
				level, the board of directors recommended a 12.5 per cent stock 
				dividend (one share for every eight shares held). “The bank 
				seeks to continually enhance shareholder value through proactive 
				and prudent capital management framework to optimise the use of 
				capital by ensuring the most favourable allocation of capital 
				through an appropriate mix of products and services,” says 
				AbdulAziz.<br><br>The highlight of the year was the bank being conferred with the 
				Corporate Governance Excellence Award for 2010 from the Capital 
				Market Authority. The bank has been appreciated by various 
				international credit rating agencies. The bank received a BBB+ 
				with Stable Outlook from Fitch Ratings. Fitch has assigned the 
				bank long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings 
				(IDR) of ‘BBB+. The agency has simultaneously assigned the bank 
				a short term foreign and local currency IDRs of ‘F2’. Capital 
				Intelligence (CI), the International Credit Rating agency, also 
				upgraded Ahli Bank’s Foreign Currency Long and Short-term 
				Ratings to BBB+ and A2 with stable outlook.<br><br>During 2010, the bank introduced the concept of ‘ahlibanking’ a 
				value based approach to banking which encompasses five basic 
				values: Professional Banking, Smart Banking, Convenience 
				Banking, Quality Banking and Responsible Banking. Says AbdulAziz, 
				“ahlibanking is a part of the bank’s culture and reflects the 
				bank’s commitment of providing customers the best products and 
				services; it sums up the bank’s efforts to redefine banking 
				habits with its convenient and efficient offerings and 
				underscores its goal of being the bank of choice for customers.”<br>
						<br>Ahli Bank successfully closed its subordinated bond issue in 
				2010. The issue size was RO35mn with a tenor of seven years and 
				call option for the bank at the end of five years. Against the 
				issue size of RO35mn, the bank received commitments for RO55mn, 
				resulting in over subscription of the issue by 160 per cent. The 
				bonds were listed on the Muscat Securities Market on December 
				22, 2010. After the bond issue, the capital adequacy ratio of 
				the bank stands at 20 per cent, well above the regulatory 
				requirement of 12 per cent. The bonds were issued at the rate of 
				5.50 per cent.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>Quick delivery</strong></span>
						<br><br><b>Ahli Bank</b> has a network of 12 branches and 17 ATMs. The 
				expansion of its branches and ATM network is a part of the 
				bank’s commitment to improve its delivery channels, increase 
				service levels and to enable the bank to customise its financial 
				operations. The bank introduced a number of new services like an 
				Internet Banking Service called Mye-bank. The internet banking 
				service gives customers the convenience of accessing their 
				account from anywhere in the world, any time at no extra cost. 
				Ahli Bank also launched its corporate Internet banking services 
				featuring a full suite of services. The bank’s SMS banking 
				service makes banking easier and includes both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ 
				transactions, many of these were previously only accessible at 
				the branches. Ahli Bank implemented an automated complaint 
				management system which allows customer queries, suggestions and 
				issues to be responded instantly or in a short period. “These 
				products have been created to enhance the banking experience of 
				our customers,” avers AbdulAziz.<br><br>As a responsible corporate citizen the bank undertook a number 
				of CSR initiatives like ‘My Hassad gives back campaign’-daily 
				Ramadan donations under which Ahli Bank contributed a total of 
				RO20,942 to more than eight charities across Oman during the 
				month of Ramadan. On November 1, 2010 it became the first-ever 
				sponsor of the Oman Football Association’s First Division 
				league. The bank’s sponsorship aims to ensure the success and 
				professionalism of this crucial league which will henceforth be 
				known as the ‘ahlibank League.’<br><br>Ahli Bank conducted a two-day innovative workshop at Grand Hyatt 
				on Leader’s Health Challenge (LHC), for the bank’s corporate 
				clients. The programme was conducted by the bank jointly with 
				McGannon Institute of Proactive Health from France and was well 
				attended by leaders of the Sultanate’s corporate world.<br><br>Ahli Bank follows prudent risk management practices while 
				staying focussed on the basics of banking. This strategy has 
				resulted in the continuous growth of the bank culminating in a 
				65 per cent growth in the bank’s net profit for the year 2010. 
				The primary goal of risk management is to ensure that the bank’s 
				asset and liability profile, its trading positions, and its 
				credit and operational activities are not exposed to losses that 
				could threaten its survival. risk management assists in ensuring 
				that risk exposures do not become excessive, relative to the 
				bank’s capital and <br>financial positions.<br><br>

						<br><b>Oman Arab Bank’s</b> strengthening its position across various 
				verticals and different businesses finds a reflection in its 
				results<br><br>Oman Arab Bank (OAB) reported a profit of RO23.71mn for 2010 
				compared to RO23.8mn in 2009. The bank’s gross loans and 
				advances grew to RO682mn from RO583mn as on December 2009, and 
				customer deposits recorded an increase of 10.71 per cent to 
				RO768mn. OAB’s board has recommended an increase in its paid-up 
				share capital to RO100mn from the current RO85mn, through the 
				issuance of 13 million rights shares of one rial nominal value 
				per share and a stock dividend of RO2mn. In the next two years 
				the bank is looking at increasing the capital base to RO120mn. 
				The bank has recommended a 20 per cent cash dividend for its 
				shareholders. <br><br>Says <b>Abdul Kader Askalan</b>, CEO, OAB, “We have not had any decline 
				in profitability; actually our profits have been a little higher 
				than in 2009. This is commendable as some of our accounts were 
				affected by the general economic condition.” <br><br>The bank’s performance in 2010 was steady as the bank 
				strengthened its balance sheet across various verticals. Apart 
				from posting good financials, the bank also opened four new 
				branches in 2010 taking the total number of branches to 47. It 
				plans to open four more branches in 2011. The bank’s new 
				headquarters is opening in Al Ghubrah. The nine storied building 
				is expected to be completed by November this year. The bank has 
				financed the extension of the Salalah Port and Duqm port and is 
				hopeful of playing its part in the new airport. The bank has 
				extended credit and other facilities to most of the petro 
				chemical projects in the country. It recently participated in 
				lending RO114mn to Octal for expansion as a part of a consortium 
				of banks. <br><br><span class="style16"><strong>New avenues</strong></span><br>
						<br>The bank has been aggressive in the retail business and has put 
				new products in car finance, housing finance, insurance etc. The 
				bank is also putting up a 24- hour call centre for its customers 
				which will be operational in the next three to four months. Says 
				Askalan, “We are a conservative bank when it comes to lending. 
				We study applications and select proposals that are good and 
				solid.”<br><br>The bank has years of experience in project financing and is 
				able to take care of its client needs well. OAB was declared as 
				the Best Investment Bank in Oman in 2010 by World Finance 
				magazine. “We are getting a number of prizes from the money 
				market regulator,” says Askalan.<br><br>Speaking about the banking industry Askalan says, “Most of the 
				banks in the Sultanate have been able to negotiate the crisis 
				well, except the ones which have exposure to foreign markets who 
				have been affected by liquidity problems, but there have been no 
				serious problems in Oman as the market is well regulated and 
				audited by the Central Bank of Oman.” <br><br>OAB has started 2011 on a positive note and expects to be

						<br><b>National Bank of Oman</b> has been focusing on building a 
				sustainable and scalable platform for future growth<br><br>The year 2010 started off as a qualitatively different year from 
				the previous two years. The global economic turnaround which 
				started hesitantly in late 2009 gathered steam in 2010. This, 
				coupled with the measured response of Oman’s government to the 
				challenges, gave the local economy a significant push especially 
				in the form of business revival and commencing of important 
				infrastructure projects. Says <b>Salaam</b> <b>Al Shaksy</b>, CEO, National 
				Bank of Oman, “The bank responded positively to these changes 
				and accordingly fine-tuned its corporate and project finance 
				lending. The very cautious approach adopted in the previous year 
				was gradually changed to one of taking measured and informed 
				risk, while appraising credit for local corporate customers and 
				giving the fullest support possible to long term local 
				projects.”<br><br><b>NBO</b> achieved a net profit after tax of RO27.1mn in 2010 compared 
				to RO21.1mn in 2009, an increase of 29 per cent. Net spreads 
				improved to 3.28 per cent, up from 3.24 per cent in 2009 
				reflecting the bank’s strategy to mobilise low cost funds which 
				more than offset the effect of the drop in asset yields. The 
				bank successfully increased its low- cost current and savings 
				deposit base by RO100mn, while reducing high cost term deposit 
				by RO36mn during the year.<br><br>In response to the better business environment in 2010, NBO 
				adopted several measures, notably the following, to increase its 
				corporate and project lending in the Sultanate:<br>The corporate banking department of the bank was strengthened 
				with a number of bright young Omani relationship managers who 
				understand and appreciate the local business environment and can 
				identify the needs of local corporates.<br><br>Relationship managers roles were redefined to focus on our 
				existing customers who required finance to take advantage of new 
				business opportunities arising out of the changed circumstances 
				in 2010.<br><br>To assist local companies, NBO reset the interest rates at a 
				lower level, reflecting market conditions which have helped many 
				of its corporate customers turn out better financial results in 
				2010.<br><br>NBO interacted with all major project players in the Sultanate; 
				both Oman- based as well as international, and offered its full 
				range of services right from bidding to financing.<br><br>The bank’s Business Development Unit continuously tracked all 
				projects which were tendered in 2010 and identified project 
				developers who were bidding for these projects so that the bank 
				could actively pursue these opportunities.<br><br>These measures created a positive impact on the bank’s business, 
				particularly on corporate customers and this is reflected well 
				in the large number of additions made to the list of corporate 
				customers in the year 2010.<br><br><span class="style16">
						<strong>Booking quality assets</strong></span><br><br>Says 
						<b>Salaam</b>, “During 2010, NBO began an exercise of reviewing 
				the existing personal loan book by examining segments that were 
				under increased stress and limiting our exposure in these areas. 
				We further began focused discussions, both internally and 
				externally, on how to begin reducing debt burden ratios to more 
				acceptable levels given the growing stress that consumers in 
				general were under. Not only did this allow us to book quality 
				assets, but it also allowed us to begin pricing our book more 
				appropriately in line with the risk of that segment.”<br>The bank re-designed its mortgage product to become more focused 
				on genuine home owners in order to ensure that it has a product 
				that is simple to understand and easy to deliver. This will 
				continue in 2011 with the intention of becoming a dominant 
				player in this area.<br><br>NBO began a major refurbishment exercise on its retail real 
				estate in 2009 and, to date, over 60 per cent of the banks 
				network has been completed. The upgradation of the remaining 
				branches will be completed over the next two years. This has had 
				a significant impact on customer experience, as well as on staff 
				morale, as the branches are modern yet traditional in design, 
				allowing clients to interact with the bank’s staff in a 
				professional yet relaxed atmosphere. Says <b>Salaam</b>, “We now have 
				68 branches in key locations across the Sultanate and have 
				opened 16 new branches over the past two years and will continue 
				to open branches in key strategic locations as and when 
				required. We also continue to expand our ATM and CCDM footprint 
				and to date have 163 ATMs and 13 CCDMs in operation across the 
				Sultanate. Due to technology changes such as EMV and PCI we are 
				constantly upgrading our network to remain at the cutting edge 
				of development and at the same time ensuring that our customers 
				can transact with our bank seamlessly 24/7, 365 days of the 
				year.”<br><br>The bank has initiated a number of projects to improve its 
				systems and provide more convenient and efficient services to 
				its customers. NBO’s network and communication systems are at 
				par with the latest industry requirements and security standards 
				enabling prompt, highly secure and readily available service 
				delivery to customers. The bank has implemented a number of 
				direct-to-customer technology solutions like Direct Debit, B2B 
				integration, Reimbursement Cards for corporate customers, 
				improved and straight through transaction processing capability 
				for Corporate Internet Banking (S@ma), and an online credit card 
				statement for Retail Internet Banking System (NetB@nk). All of 
				these have improved the turnaround time related to customer 
				service.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>People focus</strong></span><br>
						<br>As one of the best practices in the HR field, HRD has taken over 
				the project of upgrading the existing HRMS to a web-based 
				application with more capabilities to deliver better business 
				functions. This is a completely web-based one-stop solution that 
				addresses all HR and payroll needs of the organisation - from 
				operational to strategic. It includes Employee Management, Self 
				Service, Payroll, Benefits, Leave Management and Recruitment. It 
				is also designed to meet local statutory requirements.<br><br>The HR department continues to make use of its Performance 
				Management process to appraise the bank’s staff and from this 
				year onwards will stop using paper evaluations. The appraisals 
				will be done online through an HRMS System. “This will be a 
				tremendous improvement that will not only enhance but also 
				simplify the way our organisation manages performance. With this 
				system we hope to ensure further transparency and fairness as 
				well as better career management and development as an HR best 
				practice,” says <b>Salaam</b>.<br><br>The other major initiative taken by the bank is the ‘Young High 
				Potential’ programme whereby young talented staff are selected 
				and put on a fast-track development. This enables them to 
				develop the required competencies for potential leadership 
				positions in the bank in future. The bank is committed to staff 
				development, an ongoing process, which ensures that our staff 
				are continuously trained to hone their skills and take up 
				challenges.<br><br>Says <b>Salaam</b>, “While the focus will be on diversified revenue 
				growth and strategic cost management, strong risk management is 
				a central theme for the bank’s strategy to mitigate the 
				potential risks that would be encountered by the bank during its 
				normal course of business. The bank will continue to work 
				closely with its strategic alliance partner Commercial Bank of 
				Qatar, to capitalise on regional business opportunities and 
				transfer best practices across both organisations.” NBO 
				approaches 2011 with a degree of optimism that both the economic 
				recovery and the stability in markets can be sustained, pointing 
				to less volatile conditions in the year ahead.<br><br>

				position despite the challenges posed by the international 
				financial situation<br><br>Oman International Bank (OIB) had a total interest income of 
				RO36.6mn in 2010 as compared to RO40.23mn for the previous year. 
				The Net Interest Income was RO29.839mn compared to RO31.85mn in 
				2009. The total income was RO40.09mn compared to RO43.05mn in 
				2009. Operating costs increased by 7.3 per cent to RO20.82mn. 
				Thus the bank’s operating profit before provisions for the year 
				2010 was RO19.27mn compared to RO23.65mn for the previous year.<br>
						<br>The provision for loan impairment for the year was RO3.79mn 
				compared to RO3.25mn in 2009. The impact of recoveries amounted 
				to RO4.47mn compared to RO4.04mn in the previous year and the 
				bank continues to pursue further recoveries. OIB achieved a net 
				profit of RO17.58mn for the year 2010, compared to RO21.52mn in 
				2009.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>Robust liquidity<br>
						</strong></span><br>The bank opened a new branch in Saada in southern region of the 
				country. In the wake of diminishing liquidity in financial 
				markets across the globe, OIB maintained one of the strongest 
				liquidity positions by any bank in the Sultanate. The bank’s 
				strategy in India continued to focus on recovery of advances. 
				The cost of funds and operating costs have reduced. Hence, the 
				Indian operations achieved a net profit of RO1mn for the year 
				2010 compared to RO811,000 for the year 2009. The bank is 
				monitoring its operations in Pakistan closely to improve 
				results.<br><br>OIB has chosen Protiviti to implement the Governance, Risk and 
				Compliance (GRC) portal to enrich Internal Audit, Financial 
				Controls management, Enterprise Risk management, IT governance 
				and Compliance functions. OIB is the first bank in the Sultanate 
				to implement a GRC portal. Protiviti’s GRC Portal is an 
				integrated platform that facilitates a common risk management 
				approach, enabling a sustainable, repeatable and cost-effective 
				governance and compliance programme.<br><br>Human resource strategies of the bank are developed to foster 
				and enrich its employees competence and experience to improve 
				productivity. The recruitment policy provides equal competitive 
				opportunities for all to select the most qualified Omanis. As 
				part of bank’s commitment, the Omanisation ratio has reached 91 
				per cent which has exceeded the Omanisation ratio set by the 
				Central Bank of Oman. The bank has also received recognition 
				from the Ministry of Manpower in appreciation of its effort in 
				the recruitment of the national manpower in the year 2010.<br>
						<br>OIB has given due recognition to the social responsibility that 
				it has to discharge as a large corporate entity in the 
				Sultanate. The bank provided significant sponsorships to various 
				cultural, athletic and social activities around the country in 
				2010. These included the diamond sponsorship of the Muscat 
				International Book Fair, sponsorship of Khareef tourism festival 
				in Salalah, exclusive two-year sponsorship of Oman TV Channel 2 
				and sponsorship of Traffic Safety Expo, Get going Oman’s 
				official Guide Atlas, Oil and Gas West Asia 2010 Exhibition, 
				Oman Poetry Festival etc. The bank also contributed RO100,000 to 
				the Oman Charitable Organisation. The bank has made a pilot 
				project for the installation of new ATMs. Upon its completion, 
				the bank will install 300 state-of- the-art ATMs in 2011. This 
				important development will add a new competitive dimension to

						<br><b>Bank Sohar</b> defied global banking trends to underscore its 
				profile as an emerging Omani bank with strong fundamentals<br>
						<br><br>Bank Sohar’s performance during the year 2010 has been a story 
				of continuing success. In 2010, the bank maintained a strong 
				focus on sustainable and profitable growth which is is reflected 
				in its year-on-year performance. During the 12 months ending 
				December 2010, the bank was able to generate a net profit of 
				RO10.22mn as compared to RO8.02mn generated in the previous 
				year, registering an increase of 27.4 per cent. Total assets 
				rose by 22.8 per cent and climbed to RO1.25bn in 2010 from 
				RO1.02bn in 2009. Net loans and advances were higher at 
				RO897.25mn in 2010, a jump of 14 per cent from RO786.78mn in the 
				previous year.<br><span class="style16"><strong><br></strong>
						</span>Despite sluggish growth rates in loans and 
				deposits and a challenging market environment, efforts continued 
				to improve the quality of the bank’s assets and to grow its 
				deposits and loan book. The bank also continued its endeavours 
				to improve its yields on assets and to reduce the cost of funds 
				and operating expenses.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>Steady ratings 
						</strong></span><br><br>In April 2010, Fitch Ratings assigned a Long Term Issuer Default 
				Rating of BBB+ to the bank. The Fitch Ratings highlighted Bank 
				Sohar’s rising market share and good commercial franchise as 
				rating positives. It also mentioned that the rating could 
				improve with a longer operating history. It drew attention to 
				Bank Sohar’s very low non-performing loan ratio and a good 
				provisioning coverage ratio. This is indicative of both the 
				excellent asset quality and the prudent approach adopted by the 
				bank.<br><br>Bank Sohar completed the successful closure of its RO50mn Tier 
				II subordinated debt issuance in September 2010. This issuance 
				significantly improves the bank’s capital position and ensures 
				that the bank is in a position to meet the increasing demands 
				for credit in a rapidly diversifying economy. It also gives the 
				bank greater ability to provide finance for projects planned 
				during the 8th Five-Year Plan 2011 -2016. The Tier II 
				Subordinated Debt Issuance is the third capital raising effort 
				by the bank.<br><br>Bank Sohar commenced the year 2010 as the fourth largest bank in 
				Oman in terms of loans and advances. At the close of 2010, the 
				bank’s share of private sector credit stood at 8.83 per cent 
				while the share of private sector deposits was 6.62 per cent. 
				The bank has an improved presence in different regions of Oman 
				and in the capital area. It has increased its branch network 
				from 14 at the close of 2009, to 21 at the end of 2010. The bank 
				now has 21 on-site ATMs and 16 off-site ATMs. In response to the 
				Central Bank of Oman’s pioneering endeavours and as a complement 
				to Oman’s e-Governance initiatives, Bank Sohar joined and 
				migrated its customers to the new banking platform – OmanNet. 
				The new platform replaces OmanSwitch all over the country. 
				OmanNet adds strength to the banking infrastructure in Oman. It 
				provides customers with increased efficiency and contributes to 
				a significant improvement in the quality of banking services. 
				The benefits of OmanNet is that it can be accessed by any 
				customer anywhere and at any time through ATMs of all banks in 
				Oman.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>All round growth</strong></span>
						<br><br>The Retail Banking Division commenced the year 2010 with renewed 
				enthusiasm and confidence coupled with the determination to 
				improve on the business of the previous year. The credit crunch 
				in the market was palpable but it had no perceivable effect on 
				the retail business. All through the year, deliberate caution 
				was employed while adding new loans to prevent the booking of 
				unhealthy loans.<br><br>The bank’s expanded retail network gave the bank an opportunity 
				to reach out to more customers and to provide them with the 
				bank’s products and services. It has also given the bank an edge 
				in the market and strengthened its competitive abilities. <br>
						<br>At the close of business for the year, savings deposits 
				registered an increase of 25 per cent from RO116.64mn at the end 
				of 2010 against RO92.93mn in 2009. Deposits of retail customers 
				too have shown an increase from RO92.93mn at the close of 2009 
				to RO155mn at the close of 2010 – increase of 15.67 per cent.<br>
						<br>During the year, new products were added to the bank’s existing 
				bouquet of retail products offered to customers. The Al Mumayaz 
				Savings Scheme 2010 was launched in February 2010. The Scheme 
				generated positive response from customers and provided a 
				platform to communicate with them all through the year.<br><br>Two credit card promotions were offered to customers during the 
				year. The first, launched in May was exclusively for customers 
				who acquired Bank Sohar’s Excel credit cards and Internet cards 
				during the promotion period. The second promotion was a limited 
				period credit card usage promotion. This promotion was 
				reintroduced and extended by popular customer demand. The credit 
				card customer base has seen an impressive growth of 35 per cent 
				during the year. The bank completed the soft launch of the INR 
				remittance facilities that will now enable customers to transfer 
				funds in real time to India. The success of the retail business 
				depends to a large extent on the services provided to customers. 
				A ‘Service Quality’ programme was started at the branches in 
				order to inculcate the service culture and the importance of the 
				customer. Training to enhance the level of knowledge and skills 
				for the retail banking business has been provided at specific 
				training programmes and workshops within the business regions. 
				Retail staff were also brought together in the regions to 
				strengthen staff relationship, enhance knowledge about the 
				bank’s products and services, share business experience and, 
				while doing so, to imbibe the bank’s ‘culture’ of service 
				excellence.<br><br>The Wholesale Banking Group repeated its exemplary performance 
				in 2010 as well. The Group was able to increase its client base 
				and the penetration of business in new geography in the country.
						<br><br>The Wholesale Banking Group is structured on the concept of the 
				universal banking business model, a superior model in terms of 
				meeting the needs of customers. The Group caters to the entire 
				banking requirements of corporate clients from working capital 
				to project finance. The Group has been structured in a way that 
				it caters to the commercial requirements of all the major 
				segments in Oman, namely: large corporates, emerging corporates, 
				government and public sector and financial institutional groups. 
				Trade finance and treasury support these business segments.<br>
						<br>With the expansion of the Bank’s network and the opening of 
				seven new branches, staff strength has increased from 448 at the 
				close of December 2009 to 513 at the end of 2010. While 
				increasing staff strength, the bank has kept in focus the 
				national objective to provide more job opportunities to the 
				Omani work force. Twenty Omani graduates were recruited during 
				the year and of these 12 were fresh graduates. Twenty one fresh 
				Diploma Holders were also recruited to join the bank. The bank’s 
				Omanisation ratio has improved from 85.94 per cent at the close 
				of 2009, to 88.3 per cent in 2010.<br><br>Effective Human Resource planning and management is required at 
				all stages of an individual’s corporate life cycle to help 
				ensure personal growth and Bank Sohar has ensured this.<br><br>

						<br><b>QNB</b> Oman has set its sights on doing what it does best namely 
				supporting new projects which contribute to the economic growth, 
				says <b>Saad Musa Al Jenaibi</b>, General Manager, Oman<br><br>
						<br>The global recession had little effect on Qatar National Bank (QNB) 
				as it continued to maintain its leading market position in the 
				region. Due to QNB’s ability to deliver sustained growth in all 
				activities, the rating agency Fitch affirmed the credit ratings 
				in July 2010, with a long-term rating of A+ and short-term 
				rating of F1, with a Stable Outlook.<br><br>QNB Group’s ratings from the leading international ratings 
				agencies including Standard &amp; Poor’s, Capital Intelligence and 
				Moody’s are the highest and on par with a small group of leading 
				financial institutions in the region.<br><br>Conservative policies followed by QNB Oman helped it manage the 
				global financial crisis relatively well and ensure that it has 
				practically no impact in terms of quality of loans and on 
				overall performance of the bank.<br><br>“QNB Oman endeavoured to continue to support Oman’s economic 
				growth by financing companies in oil and gas sector, 
				infrastructure projects, business houses in their existing and 
				new projects and companies who are investing in manufacturing 
				activities,” says Saad Musa Al Jenaibi, general manager, Oman.<br>
						<br><span class="style16"><strong>Branch expansion</strong></span><br>
						<br>In line with the overall growth objectives, QNB Oman opened 
				three branches towards the end of 2010 in Sohar, Nizwa and Qurum 
				to ensure better delivery of products and services to customers.<br>
						<br>“I am happy to inform you that the entire three branches we 
				recently opened are managed 100 per cent by Omani staff and this 
				is our policy for all of our expansion plans. I reiterate that 
				QNB will continue to maintain its focus on the overall growth of 
				Oman’s economy,” Jenaibi said.<br><br>Continuing further Jenaibi says, “We are in the process of 
				opening two more branches shortly and look forward to 
				introducing retail banking through these locations. Our 
				performance is good as we witnessed growth in both assets and 
				liabilities during the last year and we maintained our 
				profitability during 2010.”<br><br>Since its inception in Oman, QNB’s emphasis was on booking 
				quality assets and in the last one year, the bank concentrated 
				on maintaining good assets and thus the only impact of the 
				financial crisis was seen in lower than expected growth in 
				business.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>Venturing into retail</strong></span><br>
						<br>As a strategy, the bank is careful in lending and it witnessed 
				growth in the oil &amp; gas sector, infrastructure projects and 
				stayed away from real estate, investment and stock market 
				operations.<br><br>“Our focus is on oil &amp; gas, infrastructure development 
				companies, contracting companies who are involved in government 
				contracts and large private companies engaged in industrial 
				projects and our growth comes from these areas,” maintains 
				Jenaibi. Apart from corporate business, the bank intends to 
				commence its retail operations during the current year and 
				accordingly its branch expansion is likely to be completed this 
				year wherein two more branches will be opened.<br><br>While continuing to support the growth of independent 
				manufacturing units, QNB has a clear plan to diversify and focus 
				on small and medium enterprises as well because it believes that 
				SMEs will spur the economic growth and create employment 
				opportunities.<br><br>“The relationship between the Sultanate of Oman and the state of 
				Qatar is excellent therefore, we are here to play an important 
				role in the growth and development of Oman’s economy by creating 
				jobs for Omani graduates and experienced staff for which we have 
				full support and guidance from our senior management from Doha,” 
				Al Jenaibi says.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>

				Oman, says <b>Devinder Pal</b>, Country Head, Oman operations<br>
						<br>Bank of Baroda (BoB) has witnessed an increased visibility in 
				Oman, particularly in the last one year. The Bank offers world 
				class banking products and services to Retail, SME and Corporate 
				Sector and contributes to the overall growth of financial sector 
				of the country. An added advantage for BoB is that thanks to its 
				Indian origin, it enjoys popularity among the Indian community. 
				With the bilateral trade between Oman and India crossing the 
				$4bn mark, business is expected to grow further.<br><br>While keeping its focus on serving its retail and corporate 
				customers, the bank has decided to align itself to the 
				Sultanate’s economic developments.<br><br><span class="style16">
						<strong>Consistent service</strong></span><br><br>The BoB which began its operations in Oman in 1976 is today a 
				modern bank with state-of-the-art technology serving every 
				segment of the society in the Sultanate. Customers’ convenience 
				and competition are the key factors driving the bank’s 
				technology. The bank is now connected to the Oman Switch, which 
				means retail customers can access their account from any ATM in 
				Oman.<br><br>Says Devinder Pal, country head, Oman operations, “We are a 
				full-fledged bank here in Oman offering all types of services 
				including personal loans, corporate and retail lending 
				facilities, project finance and finance for SMEs. In the coming 
				years, we see a lot of potential in the manufacturing and 
				contracting segments.” <br><br>The bank presently has three branches and plans to open one more 
				branch in Sohar after due approvals from the two regulatory 
				authorities of India and Oman namely Reserve Bank of India and 
				Central Bank of Oman respectively. The opening of a branch at 
				Sohar is strategic for the bank because of the development of 
				the Sohar Free Zone.<br><br>In the GCC region, BoB is present in UAE through its six 
				branches and six Electronic Banking Service Units and also has a 
				wholesale banking branch in Bahrain.<br><br>
						<span class="style16"><strong>Profits up</strong></span><br>
						<br>Pal disclosed that during 2010 the total business of the bank’s

				has grown by 81 per cent year-on-year. The bank has zero net 
				NPAs. Capital adequacy as per Basel II is 24.83 per cent. Local 
				Net worth of the bank stood at RO18.86mn. During 2010, the bank 
				introduced fresh capital of RO2.5mn.<br><br>Credit growth picked up by 37 per cent in 2010 as compared to 
				the previous year while deposits saw a growth of 22 per cent 
				over 2009.Pal expects to see good growth in the bank’s corporate 
				portfolio as a number of infrastructure projects have been 
				announced by the government of Oman in its 2011 State general 
				budget. “We want to participate in the RO30bn investment 
				opportunities that have been announced by the government in 
				their budget plans,” says Pal.<br><br>The bank is one of the leading public sector banks in India, 
				committed to the service of individual and corporate customers 
				in India and abroad. Worldwide, the bank has an extensive 
				network of over 3340 branches, 1553 ATMs and has a strong 
				customer-base of over 37 million. The bank’s overseas journey

				says Ravneet Chowdhury, CEO, Standard Chartered Bank, Oman.<br>
						<br>Taking about the effects of the global financial crisis, 
				Chowdhury says, “We can say we had a good crisis as we focused 
				on the basics of banking and we were disciplined in managing 
				liquidity, capital, risks, operational control and customer

				says that these combinations are an important factor in enabling 
				the bank to continue delivering consistent growth. “What is

						<br>Standard Chartered started with personal loan and credit cards

				finance grew significantly and the bank was able to expand the 
				market for cash management products by leveraging the group’s 
				network for deals linked to Oman.<br><br>To put it more succinctly, Chowdhury says, the more mature 
				business grew slowly, while the newer business grew faster. One

						<br>The focus area for the bank has been providinf international

				bring tried and tested international products to its local 
				customers by merging the international strength and 
				understanding; with the bank’s products and services.<br><br>Further, the bank’s focus is to increase its share of wallet 
				with customers by capturing more project finance, structured

				this the bank needs to sustain the momentum in wholesale banking 
				and complete the transformation of consumer banking to a 
				customer-focused platform, says Chowdhury.<br><br>Standard Chartered has also been involved in a lot of CSR

						<img border="0" src="images/cover13-april2011.jpg" width="150" height="169" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #808080">Focus on SMEs<br>
						</strong></span><br>Foreign banks are doing just ten per cent of the total banking 
				business in Oman. Now is the time to be more active, feels <b>Ahmed Qadir Al Balushi</b>, General Manager, Habib Bank<br>
						<br>Habib Bank has laid out an ambitious programme of infusing young 
				blood into the organisational structure as part of an aggressive 
				marketing plan to tap the potential SME business in Oman. The 
				focus is on corporate banking but the small and medium 
				enterprise segment is going to be the main thrust area for Habib 
				Bank, says Ahmed Qadir Al Balushi, general manager, Habib Bank.<br>
						<br>“The bank is in the process of recruiting a whole lot of young 
				Omani bankers to strengthen its SME department because the 
				future of the country lies in developing this vital sector of 
				the economy,” emphasises Balushi when talking about Habib Bank’s 
				plans for 2011.<br><br>“Oman needs SMEs to take the country’s economy forward. Across 
				the world, economists are talking about a focus on SMEs to 
				overcome the effects of the economic crisis. Also, I am 
				personally interested in this field because I have an MBA in SME 
				Management from Glasgow University,” says Balushi.<br><br>Balushi is confident that if the banks introduce innovative 
				products for the SME segment and ensure that they are lending to 
				the companies having sound fundamentals then SMEs will help the 
				banks to increase their toplines and bottomlines.<br>Just to emphasise his point, Balushi points out the example of 
				MB Holding, Al Kiyumi group and the Bahwan groups who started as 
				SMEs and went on to become big business conglomerates.<br><br>
						<span class="style16"><strong>Conservative growth</strong></span><br>
						<br>Habib Bank followed a conservative policy in 2010 but still 
				managed to make a healthy profit. All the top 10-12 private 
				sector companies are their customers, Balushi informs. The bank 
				had concentrated on trade and project financing and in 2001 will 
				be getting involved with government projects mainly in import 
				and export business.<br><br>According to him, the year 2011 holds much promise not only 
				because the world has turned its back on the global financial 
				crisis but because of the recent developments that have taken 
				place in the country. Balushi seeks to allay the fears of an 
				adverse impact on the economy of Oman by the unrests saying that 
				bankers and industrialists should look at the positive side of 
				things instead of dwelling on what has happened.<br><br>Making some quick calculations based on the announcement of 
				creating 50,000 jobs in the government and the hike in minimum 
				wages of private sector employees, Balushi says that over a 
				period of the next five years, the GDP will go up by almost 
				RO1.7bn in the real estate sector itself. This will happen 
				thanks to the increase in purchasing power and a spike in demand 
				for housing caused by the number of new people who will be 
				taking up new jobs.<br><br>Habib Bank was established in 1972 and is the third oldest 
				foreign bank in Oman. It was actually started in then Bombay in 
				India in 1941 and later shifted its headquarters to Karachi 
				where it remained as a nationalised bank until 2005 before the 
				Aga Foundation took over. <br><br>The bank integrated itself into its global network by upgrading 
				its IT infrastructure. It wants to take on a whole new look by 
				refurbishing the branches and most probably will be reinventing 
				itself through a re-branding exercise. By 2012, the renovation 
				of all the eight branches will be finished.<br><br>

						<br><b>HSBC</b> was pleasantly surprised with the continued growth in 
				corporate banking and the return to normal levels of trade 
				finance in 2010 after a drop in 2009, says <b>Ewan Stirling</b>, CEO, 
				HSBC, Oman<br><br>HSBC is pleased with its growth in 2010 and particularly in the 
				last quarter of 2010 where there was a strong resurgence in 
				business. The bank is mainly pleased with its performance 
				because 2009 was not a good year.<br><br>Says Ewan Stirling, CEO, HSBC Bank, Oman, “I think the issues 
				from 2009 meant that with banks like HSBC, which are 
				historically trade banks with self liquidating trade finance 
				business, the downturn in consumer demand in 2009 meant that 
				things were slow going into 2010. So the first half of 2010 was 
				extremely quiet but then renewed demand in the second half saw a 
				return to normal business trading across all sectors. That 
				compensated for the whole year.”<br><br>Of course the costs of banking in Oman and globally too had 
				increased. Like the costs of compliance like Basel II 
				requirements, overall robust operational procedures and 
				implementing many of the excellent initiatives from the Central 
				Bank of Oman including the national ATM switch. But, overall, 
				2010 was a good year. Stirling observes that as a result of the 
				Central Bank’s policies, not only were the banks well insulated, 
				but in fact the whole economy had been put in a good position 
				which again benefitted the banks. <br><br>HSBC also witnessed significant growth in lending and its 
				custody and clearing has essentially remained stable. On the

						<br><b>Bank of Beirut </b>continues to have a strong foothold in corporate

				branches all over the world including two branches in Oman. The 
				consolidated balance sheet will be around $9bn with $6.88bn in

				of Bank of Beirut to expand in selected markets with strong 
				Lebanese diaspora while at the same time catering to the local 
				communities. “The quality of service and the creation of 
				shareholder value set us apart from other banks,” says Aiman Al 
				Habib, AGM, Bank of Beirut, Oman Branches.<br><br>The bank has seen a 42 per cent growth in profits and an 81 per

				healthy increase in P&amp;L growth with 81 per cent increase in 
				balance sheet, 97 per cent increase in client base and deposits 
				and 5 per cent increase in non-cash. The total loan portfolio 
				has increased by 38 per cent, from 2009 with steady growth in 
				Letter of Credit and Letter of Guarantee. Over all, the year 
				2010 was a good year.<br><br>“We did not have any slowdown but we were cautious,” says Al 
				Habib. “We did not open any new branches in 2010 but we have 
				purchased our own building in Ghubra and will be relocating our 
				head office and opening a new branch over there before the end

						<br>With solid and stable performance, all the six non-banking 
				finance companies in the country made significant gains in the 
				last fiscal year. A report by Muhammed Nafie<br><br>Unlike 2009, when the nonbanking finance (NBFC) industry in the 
				Sultanate shrank considerably in the aftermath of global 
				downturn, the year 2010 saw some important signs of recovery in 
				the sector with all the six NBFCs in the country making major 
				gains with solid and stable performances. While some of them 
				grabbed the opportunity to do a course correction, some others 
				were smart enough to weather the repercussions by diversifying 
				their product range.<br><br>Massive government spending on infrastructure development owing 
				to a strong and stable oil price contributed to the moderate 
				growth of the NBFCs in 2010. Their outlook for 2011 is also 
				positive with the economy expected to grow by 6 per cent in real 
				terms on the backdrop of the government’s expansionary fiscal 
				policy and the 8th Five-year Plan targeting an increase of 113 
				per cent in investments compared to the previous five-year plan.<br>
						<br><span class="style16"><strong>A crucial player</strong></span><br>
						<br>In the past few years, the non-banking finance sector in the 
				Sultanate has undergone a significant transformation and has 
				come to be recognised as a systemically important element of the 
				financial system in the country. NBFCs have been operating in 
				the Sultanate from 1980s and their regulation by the Central 
				Bank of Oman (CBO) right from the beginning has significantly 
				contributed to their healthy growth, ensured the efficacy of 
				credit and monetary policy and safeguarded depositors’ interest.<br>
						<br>The nonbanking finance is a fast growing industry with large 
				capitalised companies who are so strong and resilient enough to 
				compete with banks at all levels. Says Aftab Patel, CEO, Al 
				Omaniya Financing Services, “In the last 20-25 years the NBFCs 
				have emerged as important financial intermediaries in the 
				Sultanate. Their being licensed by the CBO brought about certain 
				amount of discipline, regulation and structure and minimum 
				standards. In many other countries the NBFCS are not regulated 
				by the central banks.”<br><br>The NBFCs have played a pioneering role in the development of 
				SMEs and retail financing in the country. Says Robert Pancras, 
				CEO of National Finance Company, “Finance and leasing companies 
				fill a key niche in the market. The industry has developed deep 
				knowledge and specialisation in SME and retail financing. With 
				an economy in its investment phase, the potential for growth 
				will be there. The challenge is the ability to assess and 
				profitably manage the risk of lending relatively small amounts 
				of money while ensuring good returns for the risk undertaken.”<br>

						<b>Mohammed</b> <b>Al-Kharusi</b>, CEO Tageer Financing, “With massive 
				infrastructure projects and investments being announced as a 
				part of the new five-year plan and with a lot of new job 
				opportunities being created, the future of the sector does look 
				rosy. The demand for equipment and vehicles is expected to 
				increase and the corporates and SMEs would also be requiring 
				funding both for equipment as well as working capital needs.“<br>
						<br>However, what the new developments unfolding in the country hold 
				in store for the non-banking industry is still a matter of wait 
				and see. Says <b>Hira</b> <b>Lal Barwani</b>, CEO of Oman Orix Leasing 
				Company, “The non-banking finance industry is doing well in the 
				country. Prospects are brighter for 2011. We started the year on 
				an optimistic note. But the recent developments in the country 
				will slowdown asset procurement among both retail and corporate 
				investors. Besides, increased Omanisation ratio and salary hike 
				will affect the profitability.”<br><br><span class="style16">

						<br>In 2010, Al Omaniya Financing Services (AOFS) retained its 
				position as the largest NBFC in terms of asset size, profit, 
				EPS, net worth, market capitalisation and lowest nonperforming 
				loans. The company’s hire purchase assets recorded a growth of 
				13.2 per cent over the last year and stand at RO129.65mn at the 
				year end. The gross revenue in 2010 grew by 6.9 per cent and 
				stood at RO13.37mn compared to RO12.51mn in 2009. The company 
				was able to register yet another record profit of RO4.13mn for 
				the year 2010 producing an earnings per share of 266 baizas on 
				the increased share capital.<br><br>The company’s net worth stood at RO43.4mn posting an increase of 
				28 per cent compared to the previous year. The non-performing 
				loans of the company are under control and it has more than 
				adequate provisions as per the requirements of CBO as well as 
				IFRS. Says Patel, “Al Omaniya’s nonperforming loan is the lowest 
				not only among the NBFCs but also compared to all the banks.”<br>
						<br>Started as a retail financing company, AOFS has diversified its 
				product range step by step over a period. Its main area of focus 
				is corporate financing. It offers a wider range of products 
				which include equipment financing, financing for warehousing, 
				project loans and guarantees etc. <br><br>“We have a comprehensive licensing which helped us diversify our 
				product range more effectively. The global downturn started in 
				2008 which made 2009 extremely bad. But we made more money in 
				2008 and 2009 than we made in the previous years. Our quality of 
				loan did not suffer at all. In 2010, we maintained this 
				performance in 2010 recording the highest profit in the 
				industry,” says Patel. <br><br>He attributes this success story to a ‘smart business model’ 
				which provided the company with the intellectual wherewithal to 
				make profit both in growing and falling markets. Al Omaniya 
				identified and diversified itself to other product ranges. This 
				helped the company improve its profitability at a time when the 
				fall in the demand for equipment and vehicles badly affected the 
				NBFCs across the country.<br><br>“Our diversification started much earlier. Apart from equipment 
				loans, we do have bridge loans, project financing, working 
				capital etc. We are offering services for a wide range of 
				corporate clients who have diverse needs,” says Patel. <br><br>A flexible, smart and responsive business model capable of 
				changing the needs and perception of the clients automatically 
				adapt itself to the changing environment. “We had versatile 
				business plan. Therefore the course correction necessitated by 
				the financial crisis was automatic and built into the structure 
				of our day-to-day operation,” Patel adds.<br><br>In car financing, Al Omaniya faces major competitor from 
				BankMuscat’s Sayarati scheme while in equipment financing its 
				competition is with other NBFCs in the country. But lifestyle 
				business continues to be Al Omaniya’s own turf as its market 
				share in this segment amounts to around 80 per cent. <br><br>“This microfinance division includes financing cameras, 
				furniture or video players. It is a very complicated business 
				because average loan per customer will be very small in amount 
				but there will be a large number of customers, requiring highly 
				automated systems and process. As the single largest player in 
				this segment, we have developed our own in-house system for 
				this,” avers Patel.<br><br>Innovative and high-quality product at greater value, 
				competitive prices and the right capital structure were the 
				hallmark of this success story. Says Patel, “You always need to 
				define your parameters, and do business according to those 
				parameters.”<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>A strong legacy</strong></span><br>
						<br>Established in 1987, National Finance has been a pioneer in 
				financing for SMEs and corporate businesses and financing 
				vehicles and consumer durables for individual customers. It 
				currently operates from five customer locations and the sixth 
				branch in Barka will open shortly enhancing the company’s 
				coverage of the Batinah belt. “Some of our earliest business 
				customers have now become industry leaders and we continue to 
				incubate many SME customers who, we are certain, will become the 
				market leaders of the future,” says Pancras.<br><br>The SME and Corporate business has been growing quite rapidly in 
				the last few years bar a blip in 2009 due to the downturn. “We 
				used to mainly finance equipment and vehicle purchases; now, we 
				find ourselves catering to a lot of other requirements like debt 
				factoring, working capital term loans, assisting with guarantee 
				issuances and so on”, adds Pancras.<br><br>The slowdown was a blessing in disguise for the company 
				providing it with an opportunity to test its credit policy. The 
				company evaluates its portfolio performance critically and has 
				fine-tuned its credit approach based on its learning from past 
				portfolio performance. <br><br>Says Pancras, “Business cycles are a part of life in any economy 
				and our credit policies are designed to ensure portfolio 
				performance is within expected norms even in downturns. Our 
				performance has been well within our parameters which gives us 
				more confidence in our policies and practices.”<br><br>The new disbursals went up 91 per cent to RO46mn in 2010 as 
				compared to RO24mn in 2009 resulting in net earning assets 
				increasing 15 per cent to RO80.1mn in December 2010 from 
				RO69.5mn in December 2009. Net profits were nominally flat at 
				RO2.33mn. But considering a one-off gain of RO428K in 2009, the 
				net profits have gone up by 23.1 per cent.<br><br>Despite the fall in the demand for equipment and vehicles, the 
				company’s portfolio has also held up really well in line with 
				the best in the market. However he admits that in 2009 the 
				decline in customer sentiment coupled with the company’s higher 
				level of conservatism resulted in a decline in disbursals and 
				net earning assets. <br><br>Referring to the increased liquidity levels, Pancras says, 
				“Liquidity has not really been an issue except for a few months 
				at the beginning of 2009. We have been growing our business, 
				over the last 18 months and more. We are open for business and 
				welcome new customers.”<br>The company invests a lot of time on a replacement of its 
				systems which is expected to improve productivity and result in 
				better customer service. When the economy moved to a more 
				volatile period, the company introduced a conservative risk 
				stance in 2009 aligning its business acquisition towards lower 
				risk customers and began reviewing its struggling business 
				customers more frequently.<br><br>Pancras thinks that the demographics fundamentals of Oman are 
				very positive. He is optimistic that the young working age 
				population, substantial investments in infrastructure and other 
				projects and a reasonable realisation from oil prices to pay for 
				the investments will provide substantial opportunities in the 
				local market.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>Prudent and stable</strong></span><br>
						<br>Oman Orix Leasing Company performed better in 2010, posting an 
				increase of 6 per cent in total business volumes which went up 
				to RO35.23mn from RO33.10mn in 2009.<br><br>“Our net profit increased by 13 per cent to RO2.27mn against 
				RO2mn in 2009,” says Barwani. “We have done quite well in 2010. 
				We had a very solid growth. Our return on average equity is 
				12.11 per cent compared to 11.76 in 2009. Our profitability is 
				better, debt equity ratio is one of the among the two in the 
				industry, nonperforming loans and borrowing is also 
				comparatively lower. Though we have had negative growth in 
				investment and leases, it was actually by design.”<br><br>The year gone by saw a marginal increase in the demand for 
				vehicles and equipment when the impacts of economic crisis 
				started to subside. The company’s gross lease receivables stood 
				at RO73.87mn against RO76.96mn in 2009. With higher credit 
				standards and a cautious marketing approach, the increase in the 
				infected portfolio was contained at RO2.73mn compared to 
				RO2.04mn last year. <br><br>The total revenues for the year decreased by 2 per cent to 
				RO7.32mn compared to RO7.5mn in 2009. The reduction in interest 
				rates and overall borrowings led to a decrease of 17 per cent in 
				financial charges which stood at RO2.48mn compared to RO2.99mn 
				in 2009. However, the company managed to control operating costs 
				which stood at RO1.98mn with a minimal increase of 9 per cent 
				compared to RO 1.82mn in 2009.<br><br>“In order to achieve the CBO stipulated RO20mn share capital 
				requirement for NBFC companies by June 2012, we are planning to 
				increase the paid-up capital to 16.66 this year,” adds Barwani.<br>
						<br>The company continued to follow prudent provisioning policy for 
				doubtful receivables and is in full compliance with the 
				provisioning rules under CBO’s Circular FM 13 and International 
				Financial Reporting Standards. Accumulated provisions were 
				RO2.89mn (4.57 per cent of investment in leases) compared to RO 
				3.04mn (4.63 per cent of investment in leases) in 2009. “Oman 
				Orix Leasing Company considers it prudent to continue its policy 
				of focusing on quality of credit while focusing on growth in its 
				assets,” says Barwani. “We did not have an aggressive stance but 
				took very cautious approach. We improved our risk management 
				strategy, tightened our credit procedures and improved credit 
				guidelines.”<br><br>The company expects sustainable growth in the year to come 
				because the government has envisaged an amount of RO8.13bn for 
				public expenditure, which will have a positive impact on 
				economic development of the country through infrastructure 
				development and creation of new jobs and more business 
				opportunities.<br><br><span class="style16"><strong>A steady performer</strong></span></p>

						<br>For United Finance Company (UFC), 2010 was a year of 
				consolidation. Against the backdrop of subdued demand and 
				competitive market conditions, the company adopted a conscious 
				approach to improve its assets quality through tighter credit 
				norms and restrained disbursements. This resulted in a decline 
				in the loan portfolio of the company to RO72.3mn till December 
				31, 2010. Bankers continued their support through renewal/ 
				enhancement of credit limits extended to the company. <br><br>The company’s concerted efforts on improving collection 
				performance aided in bringing down the level of impaired loans 
				by 26 per cent. Despite the drop in loan portfolio, the company 
				recorded a net profit of RO1.09mn through reduction in interest 
				cost, curtailing overheads and release of reserved interest. The 
				cash flow of customers in the business segment has eased with 
				improvement in the market conditions and better capacity 
				utilisation. This has aided in collection of overdues from this 
				segment of customers, resulting in reduction of impaired loans.
						<br><br>The company made additional provisions of RO1.18mn during the 
				year as against RO2.56mn in 2009. The company maintains adequate 
				provisions considering the securities available. In addition, 
				the company maintains a Special Reserve of RO1.64mn to guard 
				against delinquencies from unforeseen quarters. The market 
				outlook is encouraging and the management is confident of 
				significant reduction in impaired loans and write-back of 
				provisions.</td>

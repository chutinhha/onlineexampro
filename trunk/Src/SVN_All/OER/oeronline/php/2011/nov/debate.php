				Oman Debate 2011 is raising various socio-economic issues like 
				job creation, raising salaries, sops and benefits and 
				Omanisation for deliberation during the Debate. It will also 
				discuss whether the Sultanate is at the crossroads of a 
				watershed moment in Oman’s socio-economic history where 
				everything that was held as sacred needs to be questioned and 
				redefined.<br>
				<br>
				This year’s discussions will be heavily focused on how 
				government and private companies plan to deal with subjects such 
				as job creation for Omani nationals and the impact of rising 
				salaries on companies and the economy at large.</font><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1" width="96%">

				Excerpts from an interview<br>
				</font></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				<b>How has Audi’s performance been in Oman during the last year?
				<br>
				</b>The year 2011 has been the most successful year for Audi Oman, 
				reporting a sales growth of 61 per cent compared to the same 
				period in 2010. This growth is, we believe, due to the fantastic 
				new models Audi has introduced in the market in Oman, such as 
				the new Audi A1, A6, A7 and A8L, and our continuous commitment 
				to providing a true Audi experience in sales and after sales 
				service. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Are there any new models that you have introduced recently and 
				how has the response been to them?<br>
				</b>Audi has introduced several new models to the market both in 
				2011 and 2010, the most recent being the Audi A1, A6, A7 and the 
				Audi A8 L. In their own individual ways, each of these models 
				appeals to different segments of the society because of their 
				excellence in design, technology and engineering, and as a mark 
				of status. While the Audi A6, for example, is especially popular 
				among business customers, Audi A1 is a fun and sporty car that 
				attracts young enthusiastic people. In line with our claim 
				Vorsprung durch Technik, more exciting new products are to come 
				in the next few months.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Audi competes with the likes of Mercedes and BMW; what 
				differentiates your brand? <br>
				</b>Audi stands for Vorsprung durch Technik – Advancement through 
				Technology. This is expressed in every one of our models from A1 
				to Q7. Although our models stand out in terms of design, build 
				quality, safety and technology, every Audi has a spirit that 
				differentiates it from any other brand. Through delighting our 
				customers with exciting products and excellent after sales 
				service, we want to become the number one premium manufacturer 
				worldwide and in the Middle East. Already now we are the fastest 
				growing premium brand in the region. <br>
				<br>
				<b>As a brand, what made you to partner with Oman Debate 2011? <br>
				</b>Audi Oman is looking forward to supporting the Oman Debate as it 
				addresses issues that affect all of us living and working in 
				Oman and in particular in the automotive industry. This 
				high-profile event fits perfectly with the Audi brand as it has 
				a long and successful business history. We are confident that 
				this forum will assist companies and government entities in 
				finding the best way forward to tackle the challenges ahead. We 
				strive to bring driving solutions to our customers and we hope 
				this determination will be especially useful in these changing 
				times.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What are your expectations from Oman Debate 2011?<br>
				</b>Audi Oman’s involvement in the Oman Debate will provide us with 
				the opportunity to actively participate in the debate especially 
				in areas related to the automotive industry and be proactive in 
				bringing topics affecting the wider industry across Oman and the 
				whole region to the table. We will be able to use our 
				experiences here to provide input into discussions related to 
				our industry. This year’s discussions are expected to focus on 
				how private companies plan to deal with the developments of the 
				Arab Spring, and the impact of rising salaries on them and the 
				economy at large. </font><hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1" width="96%">

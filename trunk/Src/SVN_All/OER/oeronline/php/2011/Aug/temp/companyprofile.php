				Protiviti, a member firm of Protiviti Inc., a leading 
				international provider of independent risk consulting and 
				internal audit services, established its Oman operations in 
				August 2008. Protiviti Inc. was launched in May 2002 when Robert 
				Half International, the world’s first and largest specialised 
				staffing firm, hired more than 700 experienced and highly 
				qualified partners and professionals formerly with Arthur 
				Andersen LLP.<br>
				<br>
				The firm offers a wide spectrum of business solutions such as 
				enterprise risk management, finance excellence, ISO advisory, 
				human resources transformation, M&amp;A services, IT strategy and 
				management, internal audit, audit committee advisory, corporate 
				governance, and risk and compliance.<br>
				<br>
				A key strategic advantage that differentiates the firm from its 
				competitors is that it does not provide external audit or 
				taxation services. Thus, its independence allows it to offer its 
				knowledge to all listed companies without having conflicts of 
				interest or breaching the Capital Market Authority’s 
				restrictions.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Omani leadership</b><br>
				<br>
				The Oman office of Protiviti is proudly led by professional and 
				competent Omanis with experience spanning over 30 years. Mubarak 
				Al Naamany is the managing director responsible for the delivery 
				of business risk consulting and internal audit services. He is 
				also the regional advisor for the oil and gas industry due to 
				his broad experience in the industry. Prior to setting up the 
				Oman member firm, Mubarak was the chief audit executive for Oman 
				Oil Company and served on a number of boards. He was also the 
				finance director at Sohar Refinery Company and the director 
				general in charge of audits of companies and public authorities 
				and establishments at the State Audit Institution. <br>
				<br>
				Shatha Al Maskiry, Protiviti’s country director is the first 
				Omani woman to hold a director position in a consultancy firm 
				responsible for risk management, HR transformation and 
				technology risk consulting. She started her career with Arthur 
				Andersen and then joined PricewaterhouseCoopers, where she 
				gained extensive international experience serving clients in the 
				Middle East, Europe, America, Hong Kong and China. She also 
				plays a regional role for organisational change projects. Shatha 
				previously worked in the USA at PricewaterhouseCoopers as part 
				of leadership in System &amp; Process Assurance and was the subject 
				matter expert in business process reengineering. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Resources</b><br>
				<br>
				The firm is composed of professional consultants with varied 
				industry and solution expertise. They provide their unique 
				contributions to enable the clients to prosper and enhance their 
				enterprise value. Protiviti is an excellent platform to build a 
				strong and stable career foundation. Protiviti hires the best 
				people, provides them with opportunities for personal and 
				professional growth and empowers them to use their skills and 
				creativity to help clients succeed.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Recent services </b><br>
				<br>
				The company has recently carried out the evaluation and 
				facilitation of CMA’s Corporate Governance Excellence Awards 
				2010. This provided the participating Omani companies with a 
				unique platform to exhibit their skills, values and qualities at 
				the core of their good corporate governance. Protiviti also 
				provided ISO advisory services for two authorities in Oman who 
				successfully got certified in both ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 27001. 
				Protiviti continues to work closely with both private and public 
				companies to respond to their needs and to ultimately deliver 
				measurable and sustainable results. <br>

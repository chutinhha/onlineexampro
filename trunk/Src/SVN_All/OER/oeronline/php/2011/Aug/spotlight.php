				<b><font size="2">Office interiors are being renovated to

				keeping aesthetics and space management as top priority</font></b><p align="justify" class="style13">
				<br>
				At the beginning of the 19th century, Charles Fourrier observed 
				that citizens’ lives were marked not by the home but by the 
				office; 200 years later, this somewhat eccentric statement 
				expresses the reality of post-industrial society: In Western 
				countries, one of the consequences of the globalisation of the 
				economy has been the concentration of workers in the tertiary 
				sector; more than half of the population works in offices. 
				Offices have become domestic, the relationship between workmates 
				has become closer and their workplace seems increasingly like a 
				club or house in which they spend the greater part of the day. 
				All presented projects feature inspiring ideas of designing more 
				efficient, modern and more pleasant working environments. The 
				modern office is a smart office which makes use of things 
				designed and made in such a way that these are practical and 
				aesthetically appealing. Smart technology at the office place is 
				revolutionising the way people, process and technology 
				integrate. Conference calling, web conferencing, unified 
				messaging, voice mail, replay line, fax-on-demand, virtual 
				office, software solutions are some areas where cutting-edge 
				technology is required to make an office look smart.<br>
				<br>
				Today, research on smart environments represents some of the 
				most innovative work being done in computer science, electrical 
				engineering, and information systems. The interdisciplinary 
				scope of the field integrates aspects of machine learning, 
				human-machine interfacing, wireless networking, mobile 
				communications, sensor networks, and pervasive computing. As 
				research efforts devise intelligent environments for use in 
				homes, offices, classrooms, hospitals, and automobiles, 
				far-reaching applications–from design and architecture to health 
				care issues and software engineering–become increasingly 
				evident.<br>
				<br>
				Electronic systems used in an office environment are comprised 
				of hardware and software components. When used together, these 
				components are capable of storing, retrieving, manipulating, 
				transferring, computing, and printing information. Hardware 
				components include, but are not limited to, electronic 
				typewriters, word processors, personal computers, work stations 
				(keyboards and visual displays) linked to a computer, and 
				associated equipment such as printers, optical scanners, and 
				modems. Typical types of software used in office automation work 
				include word processing, electronic mail, calendar, project 
				management, database management, desk-top publishing, graphics 
				and spreadsheet.<br>
				<br>
				Nowadays, office interiors are being renovated to accommodate 
				the demands of such communication, keeping aesthetics and space 
				management as top priority. Overhead projectors, plasma screens, 
				surround sound systems, sleek microphones, video cameras and 
				other gizmos find discreet space.<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Automation</font></b><br>
				<br>
				Office automation refers to the varied computer machinery and 
				software used to digitally create, collect, store, manipulate 
				and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic 
				tasks and goals.<br>
				<br>
				Office automation helps in optimising or automating existing 
				office procedures. The backbone of office automation is a Local 
				Area Network (LAN), which allows users to transmit data, mail 
				and even voice across the network. All office functions, 
				including dictation, typing, filing, copying, fax, telex, 
				microfilm and records management, telephone and telephone 
				switchboard operations, fall into this category. Office 
				automation was a popular term in the 1970s and 1980s as the 
				desktop computer exploded onto the scene. A universal truth is 
				dawning on the multinational brand names the world over that 
				brands are incidental and the solution is the driver.<br>
				<br>
				Decision makers today treat information technology (IT) as their 
				basic need for any business. Recovery cost depends on the 
				customer. The earlier the customer decides to put implement IT 
				solutions, the faster the returns. Spiralling costs can be 
				handled in many ways. And one of them is to optimise on the 
				functions of the gadgets like printers, fax machines, printers, 
				notebooks and laptops, scanners etc.<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Staying connected</font></b><br>
				<br>
				It has been found that when employers give employees an 
				environment they feel comfortable and good in, they become more 
				productive and satisfied in the workplace. Staying connected is 
				also critical in a company’s ability to respond to a customer’s 
				changing needs, with the latest technology to work around. The 
				Smart Office equipments now come in portable sizes too, so that 
				the user may even cart it along to another part of the continent 
				– and never have to miss out on an important meeting.<br>
				<br>
				Researchers who studied teams of software programmers working on 
				a project and huddled in one room for four months revealed that 
				they (software developers) spent less than half their time at 
				tasks like programming and coding; the remainder of their day 
				was spent on meetings, problem resolution with team members or 
				clients, product testing, etc.<br>
				<br>
				Isolated in cubicles, communication between programmers was 
				impaired; researchers found that the further apart team members 
				were, the less they talked to each other. The net effect of 
				ineffective communication was that projects habitually came in 
				overtime and exceeded their budgets. This research confirmed the 
				positive effect of locating employees in a more flexible, open 
				space. Time-to-market, or cycle time for the software programmes 
				developed by the teams dropped by one-third as compared to a 
				company baseline. Communication and problem resolution were 
				enhanced by close proximity to others on the team. Once upon a 
				time, every employee was housed in a cubicle or individual 
				office. These days, there are fewer permanent addresses; not 
				every employee needs a personal work station in a digital 
				workplace.<br>
				<br>
				The average office space used to be 70 per cent cubicles and 30 
				per cent collaborative or shared space. Today, that equation is 
				55 per cent cubicles and 45 per cent shared space. In the agile 
				office, a hybrid solution often works best: small private rooms 
				for concentrated work, personal work stations in open office 
				settings for team work, and a variety of formal and informal 
				meeting spaces. Work spaces are simultaneously shrinking: from a 
				standard unit of 8 by 10 feet to one as small as 6 by 6 feet in 
				an open office plan. Work station walls are coming down, to open 
				up views and allow occupants to enjoy natural light.<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Healthy workplace</font></b><br>
				<br>
				Further, as health and safety of employees becomes paramount for 
				companies, most corporate offices are switching to ergonomic and 
				functional furniture. These areas are designed to break the 
				monotony of workplaces and create a healthy working atmosphere 
				where employees feel relaxed. The trend is to create a friendly 
				ambience for both management and employees like a community, 
				where everyone is familiar with another, a place where all needs 
				are met, physical as well as psychological.<br>
				<br>
				Therefore a smart office will strive to create an environment 
				that has a smart, attractive, friendly design and can form an 
				office ambience which is flexible, effective and welcoming for 
				employees, which makes them feel like coming to work, and 
				motivates them to increase productivity. Creating a non- or 
				low-toxic workplace would be a plus point for a smart office. 
				For example: Use low-VOC paints along with 100 per cent virgin 
				wool carpets made without chemicals or dyes (wool carpet lasts 
				much longer than does synthetic carpet, so the carpeting will 
				not need to be replaced as quickly).<br>
				<br>
				Natural carpet padding (made of jute fibres encased in recycled 
				paper) when tacked to the floor help avoid the chemical 
				offgassing that would have occurred had they been glued. Several 
				practical steps can help you to create a healthier workplace. 
				The key to a healthier office is prevention – in other words, 
				use healthy and efficient building, lighting, and HVAC design, 
				and use nontoxic building materials, furnishings, and office 
				supplies. The best way to create a green and healthy environment 
				is to begin by carrying out an environmental audit to study the 
				duct system, building and lighting design, and office 
				furnishings and to survey employees. The company can create 
				corporate policies that encourage healthier purchasing decisions 
				and production methods and support employee health.<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">Designer office</font></b><br>
				<br>
				Utilities such as mobile phones, computers or laptops, telephone 
				network, printers, scanners, fax machines and photocopiers use 
				or share computer based data and software applications for 
				higher productivity, saving on time. Creative and insightful 
				planning and refurnishing of work environments are essential to 
				remaining in the race. Design is no longer an expense; it is an 
				investment. This means investing heavily at the front end to 
				ensure productivity and higher staff retention. Innovative 
				design trends are becoming prevalent and attention is being paid 
				to creative and strategic thinking and interactive idea 
				exchanges. Some of the facets of new work environments include: 
				attractive and inviting private and group work spaces; 
				tree-lined interiors and an emphasis on views; creative thinking 
				areas with drawable walls and surfaces; and even whimsical props 
				such as stuffed animals for inspiration. Traditionally 
				conservative firms are moving away from the old-fashioned look 
				and designing in terms of flexibility, technology and service to 
				create smart office environments for their employees. Cardinal 
				zones in different colours, diffuse, luminous lighting, and an 
				atmosphere that feels more like home as well as systems that 
				include retractable drawable surfaces, spatial dividers of wire 
				mesh, luminescent plastic panels for privacy, and trees. <br>

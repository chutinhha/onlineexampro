				Fast Five is a 2011 action film written by Chris Morgan and 
				directed by Justin Lin. It is the fifth installment in the Fast 
				and the Furious film series. When developing Fast Five, 
				Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing 
				theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform 
				the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By 
				doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might 
				otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car 
				culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the 
				series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to 
				action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist of 
				$100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing 
				campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual 
				games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers and at NASCAR 
				races.<br>

				Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a reboot of the Planet of the 
				Apes series. It is intended to act as a foundation with its own 
				origin story for a new film series. Its premise is similar to 
				the fourth film in the original series, Conquest of the Planet 
				of the Apes (1972), but it is not a direct remake in that it 
				does not fit into that series’ continuity. The film received 
				positive reviews and became a box office success. Three 
				chimpanzees are captured in an African jungle from their troop 
				by poachers and shipped to San Francisco. Will Rodman (James 
				Franco) is a scientist at pharmaceutical company Gen-Sys who has 
				been trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer’s disease by testing 
				a genetically engineered gene therapy on 12 chimps. The drug 
				mutates the chimpanzees, giving them a human level of 
				intelligence. The movie follows the series of events that 
				unfolds.<br>

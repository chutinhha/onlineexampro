				HE Maithaa Al Mahrouqi, Undersecretary, Ministry of Tourism<br>
				<br>
				Maithaa Al Mahrouqi, a science graduate from the University of 
				Oxford Brookes, UK, started her career as an airlines executive 
				with Emirates Airlines, then moved to Gulf Air as its business 
				development manager and was subsequently promoted as the general

				country manager of Oman Air. With a wealth of experience and 
				knowledge that she acquired within a span of a decade, HE Maitha

				cartographer as well. HE Maitha’s exposure of working with major 
				airlines of the region and her vast knowledge of the tourism and 
				hospitality industry enables her to wield her influence and 
				competence in promoting the country as a big tourist

				economic prosperity in the Sultanate.<br>
				<br>
				Making his concluding remarks to close the conference, Henk Pauw 
				says, “This has been an enormously successful conference that 
				has ensured the highest level of presentations, debate and 
				discussion on industry issues that impact our industry both here 
				in the Gulf and around the world. We have been delighted that

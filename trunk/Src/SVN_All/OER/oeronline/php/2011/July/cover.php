				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-1.jpg" width="130" height="155" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0">BankMuscat 
				inaugurated its new headquarters at Airport Heights in December 
				2010. The 32,000 sq mtrs office built at an estimated cost of 
				RO50mn combines modern and traditional Omani architecture and 
				interior design with a view to enhance the working environment. 
				The custom made building incorporates the latest technology and 
				trends, meeting the key requisites in terms of functionality, 
				security and business continuity planning. IMTAC, working with 
				its business partners, implemented the technology solutions for 
				the new building by installing the network, data centre, 
				structured cabling, IP telephony, IP Television etc. Says Fareed 
				Al Hinai, vice chairman, IMTAC, “BankMuscat has set a benchmark 
				and seeing the benefits that the bank has derived in terms of 
				customer goodwill and functionality other organisations are sure 
				to deploy a similar infrastructure.” <br>
				<br>
				The state-of-the art technological prowess of the new office 
				reflects the strength of the IT services industry in Oman. While 
				the sector may not be in your face, IT companies in the 
				Sultanate have been doing cutting edge work in the region and 
				beyond. Looking for a state-of-the-art centralised payment and 
				collection platform to replace its legacy systems, the 
				Government of Egypt was faced with the challenge of implementing 
				a solution that was capable of managing seven million pension 
				payments and six million plus salary payments per month. In 
				addition, the system had to handle 20 million tax and custom 
				transactions annually. The solution needed to be scalable, 
				secure, improve citizen services, increase operational 
				efficiency, reduce turnaround time and bring about speedy 
				administration.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-2.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">Bahwan 
				CyberTek developed CUECENT ePay -- a National Payment Gateway 
				Solution, to address these specific requirements and deliver on 
				what the government of Egypt was looking for. The CUECENT ePay 
				National Payment Hub provides an end-to-end ePayment solution 
				for the Ministry of Finance and other government entities in 
				Egypt. It has multi-language capability and supports multiple 
				currency, organisation and location operations for payment of 
				any defined services. The gateway facilitates the collection of 
				taxes of over $220mn and custom collection of $190mn plus 
				annually. Says Mahmoud El-Gamal director (operations), eFinance, 
				Egypt, “We are pleased to find IT players from this region 
				attain international acclaim and that too in creating valuable 
				intellectual property.”<br>
				<br>
				Bahwan CyberTek Group has emerged as one of the largest IT 
				software products and services companies in the GCC region. An 
				SEI CMMI Level 5 company, BCT employs over 1,300 knowledge 
				professionals, spread across the USA, Middle East, Africa and 
				India. BCT has over 300 customers globally, including Fortune 
				500 companies and clocked a turnover of over $101mn in 2010. <br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-3.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">The 
				growth has not been restricted to tier 1 companies but has also 
				helped small and mid-sized companies. Integrated Systems, which 
				defines itself as a systems integrator and solutions provider 
				grew by 15 per cent in 2009 and 2010. The headcount of the 
				company has grown from 24 to 42 over the last two years. Al 
				Kay’s International which started in 2006 has recorded a 
				year-on-year growth of 35 per cent since inception. An 
				impressive feat even after factorising the small base effect. Al 
				Kay’s has implemented a smart card system at an oil major’s 
				offshore fields. The card enables the client to monitor the 
				number of meals served by the contractor in the canteen on an 
				ongoing basis. The oil company has reportedly recovered the cost 
				of implementing the solution within four and a half months. <br>

				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-4.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">A 
				large part of the credit for fostering a digital culture in the 
				Sultanate rests with the Information Technology Authority (ITA). 
				The Authority was established in 2006 as a part of a national 
				strategy regarding e-governance and building a digital strategy. 
				Since then, ITA has undertaken a number of IT related 
				infrastructure projects, helped the government to provide its 
				services online and has equipped public sector employees with 
				the right skills to benefit from technology. Says S Jayakumar, 
				general manager, International Information Technology Company (IITC), 
				“ITA has brought about a focus on the industry as a standard 
				driving entity. It is encouraging the usage of IT and bringing 
				in an ICT culture.”<br>
				<br>
				As a part of its mandate ITA is undertaking a number of ICT 
				related initiatives. As a part of the National IT Training and 
				Awareness Framework (NITTA), it is working on a nation-wide 
				eOman initiative which aims to develop ICT awareness, skills and 
				capability within the government and the community. The 
				Government IT Training and Certification (GITC) project under 
				NITTA aims to provide internationally recognised digital 
				literacy certification to all civil service employees in a 
				phased manner during the period 2008- 2011.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-5.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">The 
				Authority is training 100,000 government employees as a part of 
				GITC programme. Replacement tests for 40,000 employees have been 
				completely recently and over 23,000 civil service employees have 
				finished training. Community Knowledge Centres (CKC) are being 
				established throughout Oman to provide free training of basic IT 
				skills. Anyone from the community who is literate and above the 
				age of 15 is eligible to join these centres. These centres also 
				double up as places where people can access the Internet or use 
				government services online. <br>
				<br>
				To facilitate public access to government services through a 
				single entry point an official eGovernment Services Portal has 
				been launched. The portal serves as the main gateway to 
				electronic services offered by the government leading to 
				convenience and cost savings. A National e-Payment Gateway (ePG) 
				allows secure online payments (e-payments). The ePG will operate 
				as a critical shared service within the e-governance 
				architecture along with Oman’s forthcoming Government eServices 
				Portal. The gateway is expected to increase the adoption of 
				e-Services along with electronic payments, particularly 
				Internet-enabled payments which are easy and efficient. <br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-6.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">A 
				Data Centre has been conceived as a part of the Digital Oman 
				Strategy. The Data Centre will enable government organisations 
				to provide better business continuity and more effective risk 
				management. Says Fareed, “ITA is rolling out a number of 
				national level infrastructure projects and focussing on security 
				in a big way.” An Innovation and Support Center (ISC) has been 
				established to provide ICT incubators for local entrepreneurs, 
				nurture skill and to transfer knowledge. The first centre, 
				established in association with Microsoft Corporation, houses 
				consultants who work with a local team to identify, design and 
				implement innovative solutions to benefit the government of 
				Oman.<br>

				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-7.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">The 
				Digital Oman Strategy has come as a shot in the arm for IT 
				companies due to its business potential. And a number of players 
				have been quick to seize on the attendant opportunities. Exceed 
				IT Services and Training, a Microsoft certified gold partner and 
				Microsoft authorised large account reseller has signed an 
				agreement with Oman’s government to provide 22 services like 
				capacity building, knowledge transfer, implementation, 
				deployment etc. The company works with ITA to promote digital 
				literacy across the country. Exceed has trained 1,000 people 
				making them computer literate. In addition, it is providing 
				specialised training to 400 Omanis. These people are being 
				imparted programming skills and a knowledge of applications. <br>
				<br>
				The company signed an agreement with the government to deploy 
				Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system on 60 per cent of the 
				31,000 desktops being used by the government in the country from 
				December 2009-June 2012. This works out to 18,000 plus desktops 
				in 70 plus government entities. Says Fawzi Al Harrassy, managing 
				director, Exceed, “We follow an approved methodology in which we 
				run a health check on computers, scanners and printers to see 
				where they stand and what needs to be done to upgrade their 
				capabilities.” The company chose 60 Omanis from over 1,000 
				candidates and put them through a rigorous 12 month IT course. 
				These Microsoft certified professionals have been deploying 
				Windows 7 OS across various organisations. “As of today we have 
				deployed over 14,000 desktops and we will reach over 18,000 
				desktops by June 2012,” adds Fawzi.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-8.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">Given 
				the sweep of government led initiatives it is hardly surprising 
				that business from the public sector remains the mainstay of 
				business for most Omani companies. The dependence on government 
				led projects increased as private sector clients have become 
				more cautious about spending in the wake of the global financial 
				crisis. Says Haitham Abu Nasser, general manager/partner, 
				Integrated Systems, “2008 was a big year in terms of business. 
				In 2009 and 2010 though the private sector got hit, but the 
				government kept spending on projects. Since February 2011 
				business has been slow as people have become cautious and 
				decision’s are taking longer.” <br>
				<br>
				Faced with a slowdown a number of IT companies are innovating to 
				stay ahead of the curve. Bhawan CyberTek has over the years 
				spread its operations to countries like US, India, the Far East 
				and in the Middle East region. This geographical diversification 
				has stood it in good stead. The company acquired 21 new 
				customers in 2010 in the US. These include Fortune 500 companies 
				like Webster Bank, Biogin, SAIC etc. The subprime crisis forced 
				a number of US based companies to look for small and medium 
				sized partners which could deliver the same or better quality of 
				products and services as large vendors at a more reasonable 
				cost. This worked in favour of companies like Bahwan CyberTek.
				<br>
				<br>
				Says S Durgaprasad, director and CEO, Bahwan CyberTek, “What has 
				enabled us to maintain growth is that we played the game 
				differently. We believed that we need to play the super 
				competition role, while others competed for the run of the mill 
				business. We made some investment in our product initiative and 
				that has paid good dividends. The company built solutions for 
				mission critical application environment in the government, 
				banking and corporates and that’s a sustained growth model. We 
				also went in for thought leadership contracts in the oil and gas 
				sector with PDO.” As a part of the thought leadership programme 
				BahwanCyberTek became the first IT company in the region to 
				offer an outcome based contract. As a part of the contract, the 
				deliverables and outcome are measured by a balanced scorecard 
				method and the company’s earnings are proportionate to the value 
				generated for the client. <br>
				<br>
				IITC has tried to control costs by hiring less people and 
				outsourcing some of its work. The company has outsourced ERP 
				related work to Wipro, the Indian IT company. It also worked on 
				bringing in new efficiencies in its workspace by using less 
				resources to deliver more. Says Jayakumar, “We diversified into 
				areas like managed services, converged infrastructure 
				implementation, portal implementation, virtualisation and went 
				in for specialised services to meet demands from our customers 
				and to differentiate ourselves from competition.”<br>
				<br>
				<b><font size="2" color="#000080">New trends in the market
				</font></b><br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-9.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">“Oman 
				is equivalent if not better in terms of IT preparedness to other 
				countries in the region,” says Ashok Sardiwal, CEO, IMTAC. The 
				fact that global trends like Cloud Computing, Virtualisation and 
				Convergence are making inroads into the market underscores the 
				point. Says Eyad Shihabi, managing director and enterprise 
				business leader for HP Middle East, “We are focussing on 
				bringing in technological innovations to Oman and are offering 
				Cloud Computing solutions with this in mind. HP has come up with 
				a bundle of offerings that is focussed on private cloud and this 
				will bring significant value and benefit to organisations.” <br>
				<br>
				Gulf IT which has been selling Google’s Cloud Computing 
				solutions in the market since April 2009, has notched up 60 
				clients in Oman. Says Rahul Bhavsar, business head – Middle 
				East, Gulf IT, “Business was slow in 2009 and 2010, but 2011 
				looks promising. A number of large customers are talking to us 
				as group companies want consolidation and a single view of 
				various transactions.” The company recently signed a deal with 
				the Khimji Ramdas group. <br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-10.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">Cloud 
				Computing offers clients a number of advantages. A study done by 
				Gulf IT shows that a company with 100 employees would spend 
				RO7,000-8,000 annually on running a conventional IT system 
				(excluding the cost of buying hardware) while on a Cloud 
				platform it would cost RO2,500. Apart from a price advantage 
				Cloud offers enhanced capabilities, scalability and business 
				continuity. So a company can start with five users and upgrade 
				to 5,000 overnight. Tareq Hijazi, country manager, Microsoft 
				Bahrain and Oman says, “With Cloud you can expand your 
				requirements dramatically. When the demand goes up for your 
				product or services you can expand and vice versa. So you pay as 
				you use.” The fact that the data is stored in large data centres 
				minimises the risk of a breakdown and loss. <br>
				<br>
				Despite such assurances there have been security concerns about 
				Cloud Computing. Says Eyad, “We have a fully integrated solution 
				with security at all levels. HP has invested $40bn in R&amp;D and 
				acquisitions in the last three years and a lot of these 
				acquisitions have been in enhancing the security features of our 
				portfolio.” Companies like Google have gone in for international 
				quality certifications and audits like SAS 70 Type II and FISMA 
				to reassure clients about security. Analysts feel that companies 
				in Oman will adopt private cloud over the next three years, but 
				it will take a while before the market gets comfortable with 
				public cloud. Says Fareed, “Cloud computing compresses 
				deployment time, but since it is a new idea it will take 
				sometime for clients to buy in.” <br>
				<br>
				Converged Infrastructure is the other big theme that is making 
				inroads into the market. In layman terms it means the 
				convergence of various technologies in a data centre. Jayakumar 
				explains, “Earlier you had different systems such as hardware, 
				network, and applications coming from multiple vendors. This is 
				changing as companies are now offering complete solutions into a 
				converged infrastructure in a data centre, thus enabling 
				efficient use of technology and cost savings for the customer.” 
				HP, Cisco, IBM etc. offer clients a converged managed 
				infrastructure in one console. This console manages the 
				converged infrastructure which includes network, server, 
				software, peripherals, storage etc. Virtualisation is another 
				way of reducing infrastructure costs. If a company wishes to 
				virtualise its server environment it can use a software 
				application to divide one physical server into multiple isolated 
				virtual environments in order to run different applications. So 
				if there were 10 servers running five applications earlier, the 
				same applications can be run on five or less servers via 
				virtualisation.<br>
				<br>
				<font color="#000080" size="2"><b>New regional entrants </b>
				</font><br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-11.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">The 
				debt problems that Dubai faced in 2009 and its fallout across 
				the region has led to enhanced competition as companies like 
				CNS, InterTech, IDS have come to Oman looking for business. Even 
				Indian companies like Wipro, Infosys and Tata Consultancy 
				Services have joined the fray. New entrants have led to 
				aggressive price cutting and eroding margins. A CEO that did not 
				wish to be quoted on the issue says, “It is not that we are 
				averse to competition and our history is a testament to this, 
				but we should be given a fair chance. If UAE based companies are 
				coming and winning big projects in Oman then we should be given 
				projects in the UAE on merit, but sadly that is not the case as 
				the preference there always goes to their local companies.” <br>
				<br>
				There is also a feeling that foreign companies winning business 
				in the Sultanate are not committed to creating jobs for 
				nationals and if the government is keen on promoting Omanisation, 
				then it should strengthen home grown companies. Says Rogeh Hajj, 
				chief information officer, The Zubair Corporation, “In the long 
				term it is a matter of sustainability. Regional companies will 
				not offer delivery or after sales support that well connected 
				local companies can extend.” <br>
				<br>
				Small and medium sized enterprises are also sore about the 
				government’s predilection towards established names. Says Sunil 
				Gandhi, chief operating officer, Al Kay’s International, “ There 
				is no proper rating or evaluation of the top ten companies in 
				Oman and as a result any contract above RO20,000 always goes to 
				the bigger companies though our solutions and prices may be 
				better.” SME’s feel that if they are not given a fair chance 
				then they will never grow in the market. Others though are more 
				optimistic – “The government has started considering new 
				technology partners and things are changing,” says Haitham. <br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-12.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">Undeterred 
				by these challenges, SME’s are adopting best practices. Kay’s IT 
				(a part of Al Kay’s International) recently implemented a 
				Quality Management System ISO 9001:2008. Says Baby Sam, its 
				director marketing, “We strive to create long-term relationships 
				with organisations by mapping their current processes and 
				providing technology driven solutions for better profitability 
				and bringing about a new dimension in the way people work 
				together.” The Al Madina Group of Companies has similarly 
				received an ISO 9001:2008 certification and it is working on 
				introducing leading web based solutions and services. <br>
				<br>
&nbsp;<p align="justify" class="style13">
				&nbsp;<p align="justify" class="style13">
				<font color="#000080" size="2"><b>The lack of skilled IT 
				professionals </b></font><br>
				<br>
				in the country remains another major deterrent to growth. Though 
				the government mandates a 35 per cent Omanisation level for IT 
				companies a number of them struggle to meet these targets. Says 
				Mohammad Sweidan, branch manager, Exceed IT, “Finding the right 
				candidates with the right competencies remains a major 
				challenge.” <br>
				<br>
				Fawzi recommends incubation programmes for innovation and 
				development to stimulate the industry. He feel that Oman endowed 
				with the right resources but they have not been utilised 
				properly. “Young Omanis are ready to work in the IT sector as it 
				is seen as a comfortable and glamorous sector. The country can 
				be a base for call centres in the region as the Sultanate offers 
				a cost effective environment and good atmosphere,” he adds. Eng. 
				Sheila H. Jamal, CEO, Al Madina Group of Companies says, “The 
				private sector is not generating business like the public sector 
				and the lack of knowledge centres in Oman remains a problem 
				area.” <br>
				<br>
				Durgaprasad adds, “Skill upgradation is the key. The government 
				should insist on companies that do product development rather 
				than trading of software products, as that the only way to grow 
				the industry and generate employment.” He suggests that 4-5 IT 
				companies in Oman should look at neighbouring countries and 
				build competencies (in verticals like auto, oil and gas, banking 
				etc) that can serve the regional market. This will create 
				critical mass as the solutions can be replicated in other 
				countries. <br>
				<br>
				<b><font color="#000080" size="2">Looking ahead</font></b><br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/cover-july-13.jpg" align="left" style="border: 2px solid #C0C0C0" width="130" height="155">Despite 
				such imponderables Oman remains an attractive market for MNC, 
				regional and local companies. Says Tareq, “Oman is a stable 
				market without large fluctuations and we see a lot of potential 
				in Oman.” The government’s thrust on creating a digital society 
				and a growing economy are the other factors contributing to this 
				confidence. Says Rogeh, “We are very optimistic about ICT in 
				Oman. There will be steady growth as the government is investing 
				heavily in infrastructure and IT literacy is increasing in the 
				Sultanate.” Like BankMuscat’s new headquarters , it’s probably 
				an opportune time for local companies to start establishing new 
				benchmarks in the region. <br>

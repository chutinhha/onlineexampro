				Ask anyone who has ever stepped into an office about his 
				experience and he is sure to come up with a litany of woes – 
				unreasonable superiors, back biting colleagues, favouritism and 
				prejudices. For some people, work is a breeze as they glide 
				effortlessly through all the office politics and squabbles. They 
				say and do the right things, get raises, promotions and results. 
				What do they know that everyone else doesn’t? The rules of work. 
				Those rules are surprisingly easy to learn – and once you know 
				them, they’re equally easy to live by. Now, Richard Templar has 
				brought them all together in one place: the quick, irreverent 
				The Rules of Work: A Definitive Guide to Personal Success. 
				Templar doesn’t just show you how to look more effective but he 
				shows you how to be more effective in today’s workplace 
				environments. <br>
				<br>
				Discover how to get ahead without compromising your principles; 
				how to project the air of confidence and energy that wins 
				respect; how to carve out a powerful niche for yourself; how to 
				handle conflict without alienating the warriors; how to read 
				your corporate culture; when to speak and when to remain silent; 
				when to stay late and when to leave early; and how to capitalise 
				on the key moments that can supercharge your career.<br>

				<br>
				If you are looking for some good insights and perspectives from 
				an experienced business manager about how to use the unwritten 
				and unspoken rules of your workplace to your advantage, then you 
				should read this book. Templar’s 100 rules cover the gamut from 
				what to wear and how to act to get noticed and to developing a 
				career game plan. If you have never worked in an office 
				environment, this book will help prepare you for what you will 
				likely experience. If you have spent any time in an office 
				environment, you will find many familiar situations to which you 
				can relate. <br>
				The book is divided into ten parts (Walk Your Talk, Know That 
				You’re Being Judged at All Times, Have a Plan, If You Can’t Say 
				Anything Nice – Shut Up, Look After Yourself, Blend In, Act One 
				Step Ahead, Cultivate Diplomacy, Know the System – and Milk It, 
				Handle the Opposition), each with ten rules, that cover many 
				important and sensitive aspects of virtually any work 
				environment. Each rule is presented in two pages in a very 
				conversational writing style that is generally easy to read. <br>
				<br>
				The Rules of Work is a no nonsense book that covers the basics 
				of a successful career. The book focuses on getting promoted or 
				moving into a better position, but the rules are such that 
				anyone can follow them and become better at his/ her job. 
				Overall, the book is informative and well written. It can be 
				read in one sitting and is the perfect companion for a road 
				trip.<br>

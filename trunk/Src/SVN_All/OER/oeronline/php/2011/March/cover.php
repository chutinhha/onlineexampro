					The real estate sector in the GCC region got severely

					Alargan Towell Investment Company’s Al Khairan resort, a 
					top-end property in Bandar Al Khyran, got caught at the 
					wrong end of the global financial crisis. As market 
					sentiment turned adverse and liquidity concerns plagued the 
					real estate market, the project got delayed and the 
					developer had a real problem on its hands. Undaunted by the 
					predicament, Alargan Towell embarked upon something called 
					‘Value Engineering’ – a process which helps to reduce 
					project costs without compromising on the quality of the 
					product. The result was a 12 per cent reduction in the 
					overall cost of the project! <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Innovation, value for money and revisiting fundamentals have 
					been the guiding principles of the real estate market in the 
					last two years. The market which was dominated by 
					speculators in 2008 has given way to real buyers. Says Ali 
					Hassan Moosa, general manager, Alargan Towell, “One of the 
					indices to measure the real estate market is the number of 
					transactions that have passed through the ministry of 
					housing, and it clearly shows a significant shift.” 
					According to the Ministry of Housing figures, confidence is 
					returning to the real estate sector with transactional 
					activity increasing significantly during the first half of 
					2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The total value 
					of real estate transactions during the first half of 2010 
					was more than RO992mn compared to RO617mn during the same 
					period in 2009 – an increase of 60.8 per cent. The number of 
					real estate transactions involving non-Omani GCC citizens 
					during this period amounted to 2,299 – an increase of 40.7 
					per cent compared to the corresponding period in 2009. 
					Despite this increase, the number of transactions in 2009-10 
					is far less as against in 2007-08. The monetary value of 
					these transactions too has been far lower reflecting the 
					presence of real buyers and sellers in the market.</font><p align="left" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

					Says Christopher J Steel, managing partner, Savills Oman, 
					“During good times the natural tendency is to build 
					expensive houses and the bubble was based on high-end 
					properties.” <br>
					<br>
					Integrated Tourism Complexes (ITCs) in Oman which were 
					expecting to attract buyers from Europe and the GCC region 
					were in for a rude surprise as global sentiment turned 
					negative. <br>
					<br>
					Blue City, also known as Al Madina A’Zarqa, was launched as 
					Oman’s largest and most ambitious property project in 2006 
					but was bogged down by an ownership dispute, design changes 
					and slow sales. According to a Moody’s report in November 
					2009, Blue City had a total sale of $74.6mn compared to a 
					target of $860mn. The 20-year project was expected to become 
					a city with a population of 200,000 in Barka on the West of 
					Muscat. The first phase was funded by a bond but the 
					developer failed to meet its financial obligations in 2010. 
					Essdar Capital, an investment company from Abu Dhabi has 
					since taken a controlling stake in the project. <br>
					<br>
					Work on the Salam Yiti development got stalled as Sama Dubai 
					got impacted by the debt problems of its parent company 
					Dubai Holding. Dubai Holding is a part of Dubai World which 
					struck an agreement with creditors in October 2010 to 
					restructure a $24.9bn debt. According to IMF estimates, 
					Dubai’s total debt is estimated at $109bn after a 
					credit-fuelled boom unravelled during the global financial 
					crisis. Omran, the ministry of tourism’s investment and 
					development arm, has taken over the project and work on 
					Salam Yiti is expected to resume in the early part of 2011.
					<br>
					<br>
					According to Clutton’s January 2011 Oman Property market 
					report, prices in the ITC re-sales market have declined 
					sharply from the highs of early 2008 but have now stabilised 
					to a degree though the bottom of the market has not been 
					reached. The report foresees a continued but gradual 
					softening of secondary market values over the coming months. 
					Factorising the new market dynamics, The Wave stopped sale 
					of new properties in 2009 and helped existing customers 
					either to get bank credit wherever needed or to sell if 
					necessary. The new properties launched in 2010 were priced 
					20 per cent less compared to the earlier phases. Says 
					Mohamed Ayjaz, general manager, Hamptons International, 
					Oman, “Prices in ITCs fell in the aftermath of the global 
					crisis as people were keen to get their money back. 
					Developers have checked this trend by pricing new stock at a 
					competitive rate compared to the secondary market.”<br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/cover-2.jpg" width="200" height="172" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #C0C0C0">The seventh property release of 160 apartments and 
					townhouses at The Wave in March 2010 reportedly achieved a 
					95 per cent sales rate within one month of release while the 
					eighth release of properties in early November 2010 included 
					villas for the first time in over two years. The Cluttons 
					report adds that although offered at reduced prices to suit 
					the current market conditions, the recent launch at The Wave 
					was not sold out which indicates that, although confidence 
					and activity are returning, the market is still very much in 
					the recovery phase. The last quarter of 2010 has seen 
					increased activity in the secondary sales market but it is 
					still relatively quiet. The level of enquires is, however, 
					slowly increasing and analysts expect the market to gain 
					momentum during the first quarter of 2011.<br>
					<br>
					Says Jose Lora, CEO and managing director, Juthoor Real 
					Estate, “ITCs have two components – commercial and 
					residential. Though they may start off with a residential 
					component they have to be driven by the 
					hospitality/commercial segment. A number of developers are 
					talking about hotels but little progress has been made on 
					them.” Almost all ITCs have drawn up plans for developing 
					hotels and other leisure options. <br>
					Muscat Hills where the construction of Phase 1 of the 
					residential units is now nearing completion plans to develop 
					a five star hotel, a country club and further residential 
					units.<br>
					<br>
					Saraya Bandar Jissah located in a secluded bay to the East 
					of Muscat is developing 2.2 million square metres of land. 
					This will include residential units, two five star hotels 
					and leisure facilities. The development is a partnership 
					between Saraya and Omran and it is likely to be launched 
					during the early part of 2011. Muriya is preparing to open 
					the Sifawy Hotel during the first quarter of 2011 at their 
					development at Jebel Sifah. The boutique hotel is located in 
					the heart of the marina town and will have 55 guestrooms. 
					The opening of the Sifawy Hotel is expected to increase 
					interest in Jebel Sifah and should have a positive impact on 
					the residential component of the project. The Salam Yiti 
					project will consist of around 2000 residential units, four 
					hotels, a marina and a golf course.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

					Tourism-driven growth<br>
					</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
					<br>
					Another trend giving impetus to ITCs is the government’s 
					tourism thrust. The Vision 2020 plan aims to promote tourism 
					as a priority sector of Oman’s economy. In 2009, tourism 
					contributed 6.7 per cent of GDP. By 2019, this is estimated 
					to reach 9.9 per cent of GDP. Things seem to be moving in 
					the right direction. Though the tourism sector showed a 
					year-on-year (y-o-y) decline of 8.3 per cent in 2009, the 
					World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) expects Oman’s 
					tourist sector to have the highest growth in the Middle East 
					and the third-highest growth in the world in 2010. Real GDP 
					growth for the tourism sector is expected to be 6.1 per cent 
					in 2010 and to average 5.6 per cent per annum over the 
					coming 10 years.<br>
					<br>
					The growth of tourism is expected to fuel a demand for 
					hotels, retail, entertainment complexes and these augur well 
					for the real estate sector. According to the Ministry of 
					Tourism figures, the number of hotels and hotel rooms in the 
					Sultanate has increased steadily over recent years, with a 
					particularly strong annual growth of 11.7 per cent for both 
					hotel numbers and rooms between 2008 and 2009 following 
					relatively limited development in 2007 and 2008.<br>
					<br>
					According to Ministry of National Economy figures, Muscat 
					capital area has a total of 93 hotels as well as a number of 
					hotel apartments and guest houses providing a total of 6,103 
					rooms and 8,849 beds. In the higher quality sector, there 
					are eight five-star hotels with 1,844 rooms, ten four-star 
					hotels with 1,368 rooms and ten three-star hotels with 580 
					rooms. A vast majority of five and four star hotels came on 
					board before 2005. New development within this sector has 
					been somewhat limited over recent years other than the 
					opening of the three five - star hotels at Shangri-La’s Barr 
					Al Jissah Resort in 2006, the four-star Park Inn at Al 
					Khuwair in 2010 and the recent opening of the 85-room 
					Platinum Hotel, which is also in Al Khuwair.<br>
					<br>
					While the growth in the number of hotels and rooms has been 
					steady, hotel occupancy has been hit by the global 
					recession. Accordingly, occupancy slumped by around 10 per 
					cent in 2009, with the five-star sector suffering the 
					largest losses. Recent figures released by the Ministry of 
					National Economy indicate that occupancy rates for five and 
					four star hotels have been around 50 per cent in 2009 and 
					the first half of 2010. And though guest numbers have 
					increased by three per cent in 2010, revenues have decreased 
					by seven per cent in comparison with 2009. Says Ayjaz, “Oman 
					should promote itself as a tourism destination rather than 
					relying on product specific selling. Secondly, we need to 
					focus on global customers as Oman is well known in the GCC 
					region.” <br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/cover-4.jpg" width="150" height="161" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #C0C0C0">The research company, Proleads, reports that there are 
					currently 39 hotel developments in the pipeline in Oman. 
					There are several significant hotels either under 
					construction or in the planning stages which would more than 
					double the number of five-star hotels in the Muscat capital 
					area. The business travel sector is being catered for by the 
					development of two four-star hotels in Al Khuwair (City 
					Seasons and Shaza Hotel) and the proposed Muscat Convention 
					Centre which would include four three to five- star hotels 
					and serviced apartments.<br>
					<br>
					The long term outlook for tourism and hotels in Oman is 
					bright but with the projected supply of hotel rooms across 
					the four to five-star sector, careful consideration will 
					need to be given to the locations and target markets of 
					future hotel developments.<br>
					<br>
					A Royal Decree (76/10) issued in September has relaxed both 
					foreign shareholding restrictions and limitations on the 
					usage of land. Public and closed joint stock companies with 
					a minimum of 30 per cent Omani shareholding are now able to 
					own land and, perhaps more significantly, engage in real 
					estate development as a business objective, a permission 
					that was previously restricted to 100 per cent-Omani and 
					later 100 per cent GCC owned companies. The relaxation of 
					restrictions should provide further impetus to the real 
					estate sector.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

					Office market takes a hit<br>
					</font></b>
					<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
					<br>
					Limited office space availability across the market led to 
					rapidly escalating rental values in Muscat up until early 
					2008 and also triggered a boom in office space construction 
					that is now starting to feed into the market. It is 
					estimated that approximately 500,000 square metres of new 
					office space will come into the market across the capital 
					area by the end of 2013. The majority of this new 
					development is spread across the western section of Muscat; 
					but an area that is showing particularly rapid development 
					as a commercial area is the previously vacant land between 
					Ghala industrial area and Sultan Qaboos Highway. Says Hassan 
					Mohammed Juma, managing director, Mohamed Juma Sultan Co 
					(which owns Era Oman), “Oman’s office market remains 
					volatile as asking rents have declined and vacancy rates are 
					close to historic highs.”<br>
					<br>
					A combination of the recent financial crisis and an 
					increasing supply of new office space has resulted in the 
					decrease of rental values over the last two years. Office 
					space rentals which touched RO13-14 per square metre in 2008 
					have now fallen to around RO8 per square metre. Says Lora, 
					“Commercial rents in Oman were higher than class A buildings 
					in the US except that office buildings in the US gave 
					tenants ample parking space, building amenities and high 
					speed elevators while buildings in the local market leave a 
					lot to be desired.” Analysts consider that, as excess supply 
					continues to build in the Muscat office market, rental 
					values will reduce while vacancy levels rise.<br>
					<br>
					Demand for office space remains steady but the majority of 
					enquiries are for spaces of less than 1,000 square metres 
					with small, good quality<img border="0" src="images/cover-6.jpg" width="150" height="193" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #C0C0C0"> offices of less than 200 square 
					metres seeing strong demand, while demand for large spaces 
					is almost exclusively generated by government bodies. A 
					particular issue that is not successfully addressed in a 
					majority of commercial developments is the provision of 
					suitable car parking with many developments relying almost 
					entirely on off-site parking on un-developed land. Says 
					Philip Paul, head of country, Cluttons Oman, “Developers 
					tend to overbuild their plots leaving little open space, 
					while what works is probably a smaller building with 
					adequate parking space.” Commercial rents are expected to 
					head southwards with higher vacancy levels as supply starts 
					to significantly outstrip demand. Poorer quality buildings 
					with inadequate facilities will be particularly affectes.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

					Residential property looks up</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
					<br>
					Unlike office space, rents in the residential property 
					market have stabilised as demand and supply are balanced. 
					Rents rose steeply from 2006-08 as demand for residential 
					dwellings outstripped supply. According to the ministry of 
					human resources, as many as 17,000 jobs were created in the 
					market every month in 2008 and the supply of houses could 
					not keep pace with demand and rents saw a steep escalation. 
					The number of jobs being created in 2010 averaged around 
					6,000 per month, and, with more houses and apartments coming 
					into the market rents have softened. Says M Sudhakar Reddy, 
					general manager, Al Habib and Company, “Rents are down 
					compared to 2008 but they are still double of what they were 
					five years ago as the economy has settled at a higher per 
					capita GDP.” The fact that 90 per cent of the real estate 
					market is residential has a huge bearing on the prevailing 
					sentiment of the market.<br>
					<br>
					Sohar’s real estate market was in for a rude shock as rental 
					and capital values plummeted sharply in the wake of 
					oversupply. A two-bedroom house which was rented for RO400 
					in 2008 is now struggling to find takers at RO150. Says Juma, 
					“The market value of land located in and around Sohar, Saham, 
					Barka and in some areas on the outskirts of Muscat have 
					declined by approximately 40 to 70 per cent from prices 
					which prevailed during the middle of 2008 depending on 
					specific characteristics such as zoning, location, size 
					etc.”</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

					<img border="0" src="images/cover-7.jpg" width="150" height="155" style="border: 1px solid #C0C0C0" align="left">Banks were often blamed for creating an artificial liquidity 
					crisis in the real estate sector. As the subprime crisis 
					escalated, banks became wary of lending to realty. Says 
					Mohamed Nawaz al Balushi, head of mortgage sales, Retail 
					Banking Division, National Bank of Oman (NBO), “In the early 
					days of the crisis, disbursal of our Al Manzel home loans 
					was slow as we learnt from the mistake of others and were 
					cautious.” Overall, there was a renewed focus on quality as 
					banks started looking at metrics like debt burden ratio 
					closely. Hassan Amir Shaban, chief marketing officer, NBO 
					points out, “Oman’s real estate is geared towards Omanis 
					unlike some other countries which were dependent on 
					expatriates, prices are realistic in the local market and 
					the government’s vision is to help every Omani to have a 
					house. All these help in making the real estate sector in 
					Oman more stable.”<br>
					<br>
					Home loans disbursement has picked up in the last year or 
					so. “People have started building houses not just in the 
					capital area but also in the interiors leading to a greater 
					off-take of home loans,” adds Mohamed. Home loans are seen 
					as a way of helping the local community meet their housing 
					needs and most banks are keen to increase its disbursal. A 
					softening of interest rates from 7.75 per cent to 6.75 per 
					cent (on a variable loan) has also helped in making home 
					loans more attractive in the last one year, giving the 
					beleaguered sector much needed respite.<br>

					for the sector. “In all unsophisticated markets, there is a 
					lack of willingness to pay for intellectual capital (due 
					diligence and research) and Oman is no different,” says 
					Reddy. As the Dubai model of building gets discredited, 
					there is a growing appreciation of concepts such as 
					segmentation, differentiation and providing value. Says 
					Lora, “Customers are demanding better prices, quality and 
					on-time delivery and developers who do not listen to these 
					demands are going to be at a disadvantage.”<br>
					<br>
					As the ITC and top-end market got hit, a number of 
					developers started developing affordable housing. Zain 
					Properties Development launched Dar al Zain in 2009 with 
					plans to develop 184 town houses and villas over four 
					phases; Elite Properties launched Abraj Zumund in Al Khoudh 
					with 34 two bedroom houses; Towell Alargan is building Al 
					Hail Homes in Al Khoudh over two phases. The project has 126 
					units with a commercial component. <br>
					<br>
					Affordable housing is a loosely defined term with prices 
					ranging from RO30,000 to close to RO100,000. A number of 
					developers misread the market both from a pricing and demand 
					point of view resulting in stalled projects or few buyers. 
					Says Steel, “When the demand for high-end properties dried 
					up, developers started building cheap houses for nationals 
					without doing due diligence about the aspirational value of 
					Omanis which has resulted in delayed projects.” <br>
					<br>
					Omanis have traditionally preferred buying land and building 
					houses to staying in multi-use apartments. But with over one 
					third of Oman’s population still in schools and the number 
					of young professionals growing, this may change. Says Moosa, 
					“There is demand for affordable houses from middle-income 
					households but this should be quality housing rather than 
					low-end housing.” For example Al Alargan’s Al Hail homes 
					offers buyers a choice of five different designs to choose 
					from, housing loans from NBO, BankMuscat and Ahlibank, 
					staggered payment options and landscaping. The result: over 
					25 per cent of the first phase of 46 houses have been sold. 
					Says Glenn Meek, general manager, Better Homes, “It’s all 
					about offering the right product to the right people.”<br>

					<img border="0" src="images/cover-9.jpg" width="150" height="161" style="border: 1px solid #C0C0C0" align="left">Iskan Oman Investment Company recently launched its Zahrat 
					Al Khareef project in Salalah. The project envisages to 
					build 586 units over three phases. Adil Al Bader, chairman 
					of Iskan Oman Investment Company says, “We are confident 
					that Zahrat Al Khareef – Dhofar project is a smart 
					opportunity for those who want to invest and for people 
					seeking a home in Salalah. The reason is that Salalah’s 
					market needs luxurious apartments due to an increase in its 
					population especially during the Khareef season. Apart from 
					being a tourist destination, it is also seeing a lot of 
					project development both by the government and the private 
					sector.”<br>
					<br>
					Though ITCs may have gone through a rough phase, they have 
					upgraded benchmarks in the local market. “A prospective 
					tenant coming out of The Wave started demanding better 
					quality forcing landlords to upgrade their properties,” says 
					Meek. Looking ahead, market analysts are confident about the 
					prospects of the real estate sector in Oman. Says Steel, 
					“2011 will be a year of consolidation and recovery. While 
					there may not be a huge upswing for the next five to six 
					years, we have definitely turned the curve.” <br>
					<br>
					Though the sector may have been through tough times, the 
					silver lining is that the downturn has forced developers to 
					go back to the fundamentals. Overall, it may be a good time 
					for the realty sector to do some value engineering.</font></td>

					<font face="Verdana" size="1">The seventh edition of OER CEO Golf, the day-long leisure 
					sports and networking event, was held on Feb 3, 2011 at the 
					prestigious Muscat Hills Golf and Country Club under the 
					auspices of HE Ali bin Masoud al Sunaidi, Minister of Sports 
					Affairs. Over 350 of the country’s most respected CEOs and 
					A-list guests went head to head in friendly competitions, 
					backed by some of the nation’s most popular and competent 
					brands. Nawras Business Solutions was the presenter of OER 
					CEO Golf 2011 while INFINITI was the associate presenter. 
					Rolex was the official timekeeper while Times of Oman and Al 
					Shabiba were the publicity partners. The day-long leisure 
					sports and networking event got off to a chipper start with 
					HH Sayyid Tarik bin Shabib, editor-in-chief, doing the 
					inaugural tee-off, setting the pace for the game ahead. OER 
					CEO Golf has always been hailed as a very ‘high-profile’ 
					affair by the corporate elite and this year’s event bore 
					testimony to that claim.<br>
					<br>
					CEOs also benefited from a plethora of business 
					opportunities as they stopped to scope out the greens and 
					score winning shot. The event opened up new worlds of 
					opportunity for the country’s leading brands as well, 
					showcasing them to the cream of the corporate crop for 
					maximum mileage and reach. Corporate Oman’s leading business 
					men got their game face on at the greens in an event that 
					has always clubbed golf and networking under the same 
					banner. A thrilling battle of dexterity ensued leaving some 
					triumphantly victorious and others no worse for the wear, 
					but at the end of it winners all.<br>
					<br>
					Michael Lenarduzzi, CEO, The Wave was crowned as The 
					Champion of champions of OER CEO Golf 2011. Martin Champion, 
					Director of Operations, Eight Services Company was the 1st 
					runner up and Sachin Bawa, CFO, Shanfari Group of Companies 
					was the 2nd runner up. Ajay Ganti, CEO, SARCO won a Rolex 
					Watch as the “Most promising golfer-to-be 2011.” Over 60 
					prizes were won by various golfers, aspiring golfers and 
					guests at the evening function.<br>

					And later, as the day receded over the horizon, CEOs put 
					their putters to rest while they got ready to glam it up for

                    Qatar has the potential to lay out the red carpet for the 
					estimated 400,000 fans that are expected to visit the 
					country for the 2022 FIFA World Cup<br>
					</b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					</font>
					</b><font face="Verdana" size="1">The days of Qatar being an 
					“undiscovered” market are over. While the country has been 
					punching far above its weight on the international economic 
					and diplomatic scene for years, its ascendancy to 
					household-name status throughout the world has undoubtedly 
					come from its successful bid to host the 2022 FIFA World 
					Cup.<br>
					<br>
					This may seem incongruous for a nation with few natural 
					patches of grass or one where daytime temperatures at the 
					time of the tournament are known to touch 50 degrees 
					centigrade. However, the vision of the Qatari leadership has 
					managed to convince the FIFA leadership that these 
					challenges in no way impede its ability to be a stellar 
					host. <br>
					<br>
					This isn’t news to everyone: long before the 
					much-anticipated announcement in December, Qatar had been 
					racking up a list of top international events. Bold and 
					ambitious, these events have turned out to be extremely 
					successful business ventures. People outside the 
					region/industry are unlikely to have noted that Qatar became 
					the world’s largest producer (not just exporter, as it was 
					formerly) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2010.<br>
					<br>
					Some may have noticed the country’s media presence – both as 
					the base of news network Al Jazeera and, through the Qatar 
					Foundation, the sponsor of the BBC’s “Doha Debates,” 
					described on their website as “a unique venture in the Arab 
					world, providing a battleground for conflicting opinions and 
					arguments about the major political topics of the region.”<br>
					<br>
					Here is a list of three of the top headline-grabbers of 2010 
					and a more in-depth look at how they have brought worldwide 
					attention to this Gulf state.</font></p>

					<font face="Verdana" size="1">In May 2010, state-owned 
					investment vehicle Qatar Holding bought the iconic London 
					store, adding another key brand to its already glittering 
					roster. Few in the luxury retail business needed another 
					reminder that Qataris like to shop – but those unacquainted 
					with the Qatari market reacted with a mix of befuddlement 
					and curiosity.<br>
					<br>
					It takes a delicate blend of exclusivity, innovation and 
					buzz to become a destination on the international luxury 
					shopping circuit. With such a high-profile move into the 
					market in London, Qatar has certainly managed to attract the 
					attention of this high-margin set, and may consequently see 
					more people coming to explore retail options in Doha. The 
					city certainly looks set to capitalise on this interest, 
					with gross leasable area (GLA) of retail space set to double 
					to 400,000 sq metres over the coming years.<br>

					Brazil-Argentina match<br>
					</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					Held just before the 2022 bid results were announced, this 
					game is widely credited with clinching the host position for 
					Qatar. The timing could have hardly been better: the 
					legendary South American rivals had been tied in a dead heat 
					of 33 wins each over their last 89 encounters. The 
					successful accommodation of 40,000 fans was touted as proof 
					that the peninsula had the potential to support the 
					estimated 400,000 fans that are expected to descend in 2022. 
					This was far from the first high-profile match played in 
					Qatar – November 2009’s England-Brazil stands out – but it 
					was the most widely watched sporting event to date, airing 
					on ESPN worldwide and giving many football lovers their 
					first glimpse of the country.<br>

					<b><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#C00000">Stake in 
					Santander<br>
					</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					Already well-known for its high-profile investments in 
					Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, Qatar Holding made a 
					splash when it announced in October 2010 that it would 
					acquire a five per cent stake in banking giant Santander’s 
					Brazil operations, making it the second-largest stakeholder 
					in the Latin American bank. The move lent credence to the 
					country’s ambitions to be a truly global financial player, 
					and set it up well to access further Latin American markets. 
					It was also among Qatar’s most value-conscious investments 
					to date, with the bonds Qatar Holding bought to convert into 
					shares exchanging at QAR23.75 a share, at the time below 
					market value. In addition, Santander’s chairman reported 
					that the bank expects higher profit from Brazil than Spain 
					this year in October. To those who had doubts, this key 
					acquisition proved that Qatar isn’t treating its investments 
					lightly. </font></p>

				Choosing the right tyre to suit your car and driving style is 
				the most cost effective way to improve the performance of your 
				vehicle. Your safety and driving enjoyment over the next years 
				and thousands of kilometre will be determined by this decision. 
				Here is a guide to help you take the correct decision and make 
				it just a little bit easier</span></strong></font><b><br>
				<br>
				Choosing the number</b> When the time comes for you to change 
				your tyres the very first thing that you need to decide is how 
				many tyres you really need. Since tyres affect the performance 
				of your vehicle, all four tyres should be as identical as 
				possible or handling problems may arise. Because of this, the 
				only time that you will be required to change a single tyre is 
				if your other tyres have a lot of remaining tread depth and the 
				one you need to replace has been damaged by an accident, road 
				hazard or a vandal. Even then you should replace it with a tyre 
				that exactly matches the others. Select a replacement tyre of 
				the same brand, size and speed rating.<br>
				<br>
				<img border="0" src="images/spotlight1-may2011.jpg" width="195" height="281" style="border: 1px solid #808080" align="right">In 
				most cases you will need to change tyres because they have worn 
				out. In such situations, if two of your tyres have a lot of 
				remaining tread depth, but you need to replace the other two, 
				you should replace them with a pair of tyres that come as close 
				as possible to matching your existing tyres. While identical new 
				tyres are desirable, others of the same size and type can also 
				provide good results. Only consider selecting new tyres that are 
				from the same tyre category as your existing tyres. Also, new 
				tyres should be installed on the rear axle.<br>
				<br>
				If one pair of tyres have worn faster than the others, it is 
				advisable to ask your mechanic why this has occurred. Was it 
				caused by a lack of tyre rotation, out-of-spec wheel alignment 
				or loose mechanical parts? Once the problem has been found, it 
				can be corrected before it damages your new set. Keep in mind 
				that your ultimate goal is that all of your tyres always wear 
				out at the same time so they can be replaced as a set. If all of 
				your tyres are wearing out together, you have the greatest 
				flexibility in tyre selection. If you were happy with the 
				original tyres, simply replace them. If you want longer 
				treadwear, a smoother ride or more handling, there are probably 
				tyres that will help you accomplish that. A little bit of online 
				research will go a long way in helping you decide on just the 
				right tyre to suit your needs.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The size matters<br>
				</b>When you have finally decided on the tyre that you want 
				fitted to your vehicle, the next most important ting is choosing 
				the correct size. A tyre’s first requirement is that it must be 
				able to carry the weight of your vehicle. No matter how good a 
				tyre you select, if its capabilities are “overworked” just 
				carrying the load, it will have little reserve capacity to help 
				your vehicle respond quickly in an emergency. So when you are in 
				the selection process, make certain that your new tyre’s size is 
				designed to carry the weight of your vehicle! Don’t undersize.<br>
				<br>
				The other size consideration is overall tyre diameter. Since 
				many of the functions of today’s vehicles are highly 
				computerized, maintaining accurate speed data going into the 
				computer assures accurate instructions coming out. And an 
				important part of the speed equation is your tyre’s overall tyre 
				diameter. For cars and vans, staying within a three per cent 
				diameter change is desirable. Pick-ups and sport utility 
				vehicles (SUVs) are usually engineered to handle up to a 15 per 
				cent oversize tyre.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Driving conditions<br>
				</b>The next important step is analysing the conditions that you 
				will be using the vehicle in be it sunshine, rain or snow, 
				though the latter is not something that we can consider here in 
				Oman but should prove useful if you plan on heading to a country 
				where it is relevant. This analysis should be taken a step 
				further when deciding on tyres for SUV’s, especially if you plan 
				on taking your vehicle off-road. <br>
				<br>
				If you live in an area where you face an extreme change in 
				weather it is advisable to have more than one set of tyres and 
				wheels (for example, summer tyres in summer and snow tyres in 
				winter). This also allows you to quite easily select tyres that 
				exactly meet your diverse needs. On the other hand if you decide 
				to use one set of tyres for every season, you may get good 
				performance under many conditions, but your vehicle’s 
				performance will be compromised when the conditions are at their 
				worst. <br>
				<br>
				When it comes to SUVs that you will be taking off road, the 
				important thing to do is to select your tyres so that they match 
				the typical off-road driving conditions you expect to encounter. 
				It is advisable to check with your local tyre dealership for the 
				best tyres to suit your conditions or even a little bit of 
				online research will go a long way in making the right choice.<br>
				<br>
				On the other hand, if you only drive around your neighbourhood 
				almost any tyre will do. But if you drive your vehicle on 
				congested city streets and expressways during rush hour you will 
				be better served by more responsive tyres. If you drive 
				extensively on high ways and consistently travel long distances, 
				you will want quiet, smooth riding, long wearing tyres. Or if 
				you like to drive quickly on twisting roads or through the 
				mountains you will want good handling tyres. And if you drive on 
				the track or in autocross events, you will want the best 
				competition tyres available. So in conclusion, if your worst 
				driving conditions and your typical conditions are similar, one 
				set of tyres will be all you need. If you live at the edge of 
				the snowbelt and infrequently get snow you may want to select an 
				all-season tyre. If your SUV is used as the family’s station 
				wagon and driven on the road all of the time, overly aggressive 
				light truck tyres aren’t for you. <br>
				<br>
				If your worst driving condition occurs frequently and is 
				dissimilar to your typical driving condition, you may want to 
				consider selecting two sets of tyres for your vehicle. Each set 
				will be designed to master the specific conditions without 
				compromising your driving satisfaction at the extremes. While 
				purchasing two sets of tyres may appear expensive, the set 
				you’re not using won’t wear while you are using the other set, 
				and combined they’ll provide longer total wear than either set 
				could individually.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Fitting to the budget<br>
				</b>And finally, the most important consideration that you will 
				have to make is deciding on a tyre that fits your budget. Buying 
				good tyres is never cheap and sometimes when you are selecting 
				new tyres and find one that is perfect, although more expensive 
				than another tyre that appears to be a close second, what can 
				you do? The answer is quite simple – consider evaluating your 
				situation by comparing ‘how much per km’ each tyre will cost. If 
				you plan to drive your vehicle another 40,000 kms and are 
				considering the ‘perfect’ tyres at 50 rials each, and the other 
				at 45 rials each; you may be surprised to find out that the cost 
				of the ‘perfect’ set costs just 1.25 baisas per km while the 
				close set costs 1.13 baisas per km. so the question you will 
				have to answer is “will saving the 20 rials today make up for 
				not having selected the perfect tyre’ that you will be driving 
				on for the next two years?</td>

				With summer round the corner, it is advisable to be pro-active 
				and check the condition of your tyres, lest it gets too late and 
				you’re left stranded on the road with a burst tyre. Before we 
				get down to the nitty gritties, lets understand what the 
				sidewall markings on tyres denote.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Side wall markings on a tyre<br>
				</b><br>
				<b><font color="#C00000">P215/65R15 89H</font><br>

				<br>
				<b>Tyre maintenance<br>
				</b>Any tyre, no matter how well constructed, may fail in use as 
				a result of punctures, impact damage, improper inflation or 
				other conditions resulting from use. Tyre failures may result in 
				damage to the vehicle or personal injury. To minimise the risk 
				of tyre failure, we strongly recommend the following:<br>
				<b><br>
				Inflation pressure – </b>Tyre pressure including the spare, 
				should be checked at least once a month before driving, when the 
				tyres are cold. Maintaining the recommended tyre pressure 
				provides proper sidewall deflection and safe operating 
				temperatures for the tyres. It is also very important to tyre 
				life, safety and vehicle handling. Under inflation creates 
				excessive heat; lower load carrying capacity and can seriously 
				reduce tyre life. Irregular wear can also be caused by under or 
				over inflation. Use dust caps on valves to maintain an airtight 
				seal while keeping dust and moisture out.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tyre rotation for passenger cars - </b>The purpose of 
				rotating tyres is to achieve a more uniform tyre wear for all 
				tyres on a vehicle. Before rotating tyres, determine the cause 
				of any unusual wear and correct any mis-alignment, imbalance or 
				other mechanical problems. First rotation should be done after 
				the 5,000 to 7,500 km and every subsequent rotation, after every 
				10,000 km. Do not mix radials and bias ply tyres on the same 
				axle. Temporary spare tyres cannot be rotated as shown above. Do 
				not mix or rotate different speed rated tyres.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Wheel alignment and balancing –</b> These are very important 
				considerations for deriving safety and maximum mileage from your 
				tyres, Check how your tyres are wearing out at least once a 
				month. If your tyres are wearing out unevenly, such as the 
				inside shoulder is wearing out faster than the rest of the 
				tread, your car may be out of alignment. This condition not only 
				reduces the life of your tyre but also adversely affects the 
				handling characteristics of your car, which could be dangerous. 
				An imbalanced tyre and rim assembly may also be a cause of 
				vibration at certain speeds. Prolonged use of the tyres in such 
				a condition can lead to tyre damage.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tyre Replacement - </b>There are Tread Wear Indicators (TWI) 
				on the sidewall of your tyre. These indicators are at a depth of 
				1.6mm. When the tread of your tyre gets worn out due to use and 
				comes down to the level of these indicators, it is an indication 
				to replace your tyre. When your tyre gets damaged due to side 
				wall cuts, tread cuts, damaged beads etc, it is again time to 
				replace the tyre. When replacing your tyres, it is best advised 
				to stick to the specifications as laid down by the car 
				manufacturer. Filling your tyres with nitrogen would be a good 
				idea as this will keep your tyres cool and at the same time keep 
				the air pressure constant for months together.<p class="style15" style="text-align: center">

				<font color="#0000FF" size="2">The History<br>
				</font><br>
				DOWN MEMORY LANE <br>
				</b>The Middle East isn’t exactly known for its pleasant 
				summers. But thankfully we can more than cope with the heat 
				thanks to an, often overlooked, invention called the air 
				conditioner. But how did they come into existence and who was 
				the true inventor of the air conditioner? Read on to find out. 
				First and foremost, before we go into the business breakdown of 
				air conditioners, let us explain how it all began and how the 
				modern air con came into existence. <br>
				While air conditioning itself is a relatively new invention, the 
				cooling of buildings is not. It is known that wealthy ancient 
				Romans used aqueducts to circulate water through walls to cool 
				their luxurious houses. Even as far back as the 2nd century 
				China there have been records of some form of air conditioning. 
				It is recorded that inventor Ding Huan, of the Han Dynasty, 
				invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3m 
				in diameter and was manually powered. In 747, Emperor Xuanzong 
				of the Tang Dynasty had a Cool Hall, called Liang Tian, built in 
				the imperial palace and was said to have water-powered fan 
				wheels for air conditioning as well as a rising jet stream of 
				water from fountains. During the subsequent Song Dynasty, 
				written records mentioned the widespread use of rotary fan as a 
				means of air conditioning.<br>
				<br>
				Even medieval Persia was said to have some sort of cooling 
				system for buildings during hot weather seasons. They used 
				cisterns, which were large open pools in the central courtyards 
				used to collect rain water, in conjunction with impressive wind 
				towers. These wind towers had windows to catch the wind which 
				was then directed, using internal vanes, down into the building, 
				over the cistern and out through a downwind cooling tower. As 
				the cistern water evaporated it cooled the air inside the 
				building. In 1200AD, Abd al-Latif al-Baghda described the use of 
				ventilators in various households in Egypt. He reported that 
				almost every house in Cairo has a ventilator, and that they cost 
				anywhere from 1 to 500 dinars depending on their sizes and 
				shapes. In fact it is said that Ventilators were actually 
				invented in medieval Egypt.<br>
				<br>
				But it was only in 1820 that British scientist and inventor 
				Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying 
				ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed 
				to evaporate. In 1842, a Florida physician John Gorrie used 
				compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air 
				for his patients in his hospital. He hoped eventually to use his 
				ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings and 
				even envisioned centralised air conditioning that could cool 
				entire cities. Although his prototype leaked and performed 
				irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his 
				ice-making machine. Unfortunately, any hopes for its success 
				soon vanished with the death of his chief financial backer; 
				without the money he needed there was no way to develop the 
				machine commercially. According to his biographer, Vivian M. 
				Sherlock, he blamed the “Ice King”, Frederic Tudor, for his 
				failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a smear campaign 
				against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855 and 
				the idea of air conditioning faded with him for the next 50 
				years.<br>
				In 1902 the first modern electrical air conditioning was 
				invented by Willis Haviland Carrier. Designed to improve 
				manufacturing process control in a printing plant, his invention 
				controlled not only temperature but also humidity. The low heat 
				and humidity were to help maintain consistent paper dimensions 
				and ink alignment. Later Carrier’s technology was applied to 
				increase productivity in the workplace. <br>
				<br>
				This led to the formation of The Carrier Air Conditioning 
				Company of America to meet rising demand. In 1906 Stuart W. 
				Cramer was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his 
				textile mill. Cramer coined the term “air conditioning”, using 
				it in a patent claim he filed that year. He combined moisture 
				with the ventilation to “condition” (This evaporation of water 
				in air, to provide a cooling effect, is now known as evaporative 
				cooling) and change the air in the factories, controlling the 
				humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted 
				the term “air conditioning” and incorporated it into the name of 
				his company. Early commercial applications of air conditioning 
				were primarily to provide cool air for industrial processing 
				rather than personal comfort but over time air conditioning came 
				to be used to improve comfort in homes and later in automobiles. 
				In fact it wasn’t until the 1950s that Residential sales 
				expanded dramatically.<br>
				<br>
				The first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or 
				flammable gases like ammonia, methyl chloride, and propane which 
				could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, 
				Jr. created the first chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon, in 1928. 
				The refrigerant was much safer for humans but was later found to 
				be harmful to the atmosphere which resulted biological 
				consequences including an increase in skin cancer, damage to 
				plants, and the reduction of ocean plankton. Freon is a 
				trademark name of DuPont (an American chemical company) for any 
				Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), Hydrogenated CFC (HCFC), or 
				Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The blend most used in 
				direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC 
				known as R-22. It is to be completely phased out by 2020. 
				Several non-ozone depleting refrigerants have been developed as 
				alternatives, including R-410A, invented by Honeywell in Buffalo 
				NY and sold under the Genetron AZ-20 name.<br>
				INNOVATION IN AIR CONDITIONING technologies continue, with much 
				recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency and improving indoor 
				air quality. As an alternative to conventional refrigerants, 
				natural alternatives like CO2 (R-744) have been proposed. We 
				only have to wait and see what comes of it.<br>
				<br>
				<b>A whopping market in Middle East <br>
				</b>While globally the air-conditioning market is growing by 
				leaps and bounds, in countries such as the Middle East the 
				segment has witnessed enormous growth. In the GCC for instance, 
				massive construction drives spurring the development of numerous 
				residential and commercial real estate projects and high 
				population growth have fuelled demand for air-conditioners and 
				cooling systems. <br>
				<br>
				The boom in real estate development together with the growing 
				emphasis on greater cooling facilities and the resultant 
				increase in power demand have all contributed to creating huge 
				opportunities for manufactures and distributors in district 
				cooling. This trend has received added impetus in recent years 
				with the lack of sufficient generation, transmission and 
				distribution infrastructure to meet projected power demands.<br>
				<br>
				The Middle East has been a major market for air-conditioners, 
				coolants and refrigerators, chiefly due to the region’s arid 
				climatic conditions. However, in recent times, other factors 
				have been reinforcing the market’s growth in the segment. These 
				include improvements <br>
				in lifestyle, the mushrooming of numerous malls and hypermarkets 
				all over the region and other developmental activities, all of 
				which has spurred demand for air-conditioning products. ‘Air 
				conditioners have come a long way from being just a cooling 
				machine. Today we have models that can detect and eliminate 
				deadly disease causing agents like SARS and bird-flu virus and 
				other harmful pathogens this is done through a technology called 
				MPI [Micro Plasma Ion], a world’s first from SAMSUNG,’ says Ajay 
				Ganti, CEO, SARCO distributors for SAMSUNG in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				He goes on to add that newer models of air-conditioners 
				“incorporate what is called GOOD SLEEP MODE, which senses your 
				body temperature to regulate the room temperature. There is a 
				lot of focus on hygiene and health. There is also a lot of 
				impetus on the design accent to turn the air-conditioner into a 
				piece of art, to make it a part of your interior decor. So 
				basically, the AC is a lifestyle product rather than just a 
				cooling product”.<br>
				<br>
				In Oman, the air-conditioner and refrigerator market account for 
				a whopping 65 to 70 per cent of all business in the white goods 
				market. “The market size of air-conditioning products is around 
				200 K units a year in Oman. The market size for Refrigerators is 
				around 80 K units a year. Also due to a very fertile commercial 
				/ industrial projects scenario, there is also a great business 
				opportunity for different air-conditioning concepts like 
				chiller, ducted type or DVM(digital Variable Multi),” says Ganti. 
				Traditionally, the Sultanate has been a market for window ACs. 
				That trend is rapidly changing as improved standards of living 
				and more sophisticated lifestyles push customer preference to 
				split and ducted air-conditioners. This is in line with global 
				trends. Apart from lifestyle changes and economic development, 
				price reductions in split units have driven demand for these 
				models of air-conditioners. What’s more, the air-conditioner 
				which was earlier regarded as a seasonal product now boasts 
				decent sales figures even during off-season. In Oman extreme

				</b></font><br>
				<b><font size="2">New Range of ACs Incorporate Advance+Plus 
				e-Ion Air Purifying System<br>
				</font></b><br>
				Panasonic, the global leader in innovation and technology, 
				recently launched new range of ECONAVI dual sensor ACs for the 
				Middle East market. <br>
				<br>
				Panasonic who are on course to be the “No.1 Green Innovation 
				electronics Company” has upgraded the company’s existing range 
				of air conditioners by introducing ECONAVI technology, which in 
				simple terms senses the presence of user in the room and auto 
				adjusts the set temperature to an energy efficient level in case 
				of low activity detection. <br>
				<br>
				The new ACs use 30 pe rcent less energy when cooling, and up to 
				40 percent less energy when heating. ECONAVI concept applies 
				high precision Human Sensor and Control Program technologies to 
				optimize air conditioner operation according to room conditions. 
				The units utilize this technology to detect where energy is 
				normally wasted and self-adjusts cooling and heating power.<br>
				<br>
				The ECONAVI concept reduces waste in three simple steps. It 
				examines the level of activity and human presence in a room. It 
				then evaluates changes in location, activity and then adjusts 
				the level of airflow needed. <br>
				<br>
				“Going green by saving energy shouldn’t compromise your 
				comfortable lifestyle. With a Panasonic air conditioner, 
				individuals get to enjoy cleaner air provided by the 
				Advanced+Plus e-ion Air Purifying System featuring the ECONAVI 
				Sensor. The result is a better quality of life,” comments Shoaib 
				Senior Manager, Panasonic Marketing Middle East. <br>
				<br>
				Advance+Plus e-ion technology is designed to monitor changes in 
				the degree of air cleanliness. It activates the air purifying 
				function when necessary to maintain clean and healthier air. <br>
				<br>
				AUTOCOMFORT is another feature incorporated into the new range 
				of ECONAVI Series of ACs. AUTOCOMFORT enables consumers to enjoy 
				the same functions as ECONAVI with lower energy saving mode when 
				additional cooling/heating is not required. With one touch of a 
				button, the air conditioner detects activity rate in the room 
				and optimizes comfort, while still maintaining lower 
				energy-saving operations. The user gets to enjoy optimal 
				comfort, all at the touch of one button same as the ECONAV 
				function.<br>
				<br>
				Panasonic air conditioners also come with an in-built air 
				purifying system. Whether the air conditioner is switched on or 
				off, one touch of a button activates the function. As soon as 
				the Patrol Sensor detects the level of dust particles in the air 
				has reached an unhealthy level, e-ions are released to clean the 
				air from dust and harmful micro-organisms.<br>
				<br>
				The new range of ECONAVI ACs have been developed and launched 
				considering the requirements of the Middle East region. Keeping 
				in mind the region’s climatic conditions and space restrictions 
				with a rise in the apartment lifestyle, the new range of ACs 
				retains the best features of both spilt and window – stronger 
				air throw with reduced noise levels, quick cooling, sleek and 
				stylish looks, can be mounted on the wall and most importantly, 
				is an economical option. <br>
				<br>
				ECONAVI by Panasonic is smart, intelligent &amp; innovative 
				technology. It scans the area for Human presence, activity rate 
				and directs air flow to the area which is occupied for effective 
				and efficient cooling.<hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1" width="95%">

				<b><font size="2"><font color="#0000FF">WHAT MATTERS MOST </font>
				<br>
				<br>
				It is important to know the basics about air conditioners before 
				purchasing one. Here are a few tips to understand the 
				differences between the various choices available <br>
				</font></b><br>
				<br>
				One of the most common type of air conditioner that we come 
				across on a day-to-day basis is the room air conditioner. This 
				is an enclosed cooling unit that can be mounted in a window, 
				through a wall or in a portable cabinet on a floor near a 
				window. Its job is to cool the air in a small, confined area as 
				directed by the unit’s controls. Some window air conditioners 
				have other functions as well. For example, reverse intake air 
				conditioners also work as heaters, making them a home appliance 
				that is useful nearly year-round, not that it would be of much 
				use here.<br>
				<br>
				Window air conditioners work similarly to central air 
				conditioning systems, but are contained in one compact unit. 
				When the room air conditioner unit is on, the condenser pulls in 
				the refrigerant gas and pressurises it, raising the temperature 
				of the gas. The heated high-pressure gas then travels to the 
				condenser coils on the outdoor side of the unit where fins 
				distribute the collected heat. The cooled gas then condenses 
				into a liquid that moves indoor to the evaporator coils where it 
				absorbs heat from the room. A fan moves the air through the unit 
				and expels the cooled air into the room. <br>
				<br>
				For the most part split-unit air conditioners are almost the 
				same as window air conditioners, their primary difference being 
				that the cold side, consisting of the expansion valve and the 
				cold coil, is split from the hot side of the system, which is 
				placed outside the building. These are more effective at cooling 
				larger rooms that basic window ACs.<br>
				<br>
				A thermostat controls the unit’s operation. Many units now have 
				advanced electronic controls that can adjust one degree at a 
				time, rather than the primitive “cool” or “cooler” dial settings 
				that were once common. The electronic controls also may regulate 
				the fan speed, operation mode, timer and other settings. In 
				addition, many room air conditioners at a variety of price 
				points even include a remote. Split-unit air conditioners are 
				even more advanced, offering a number of features, some even 
				including bacterial control systems. <br>
				<br>
				An air conditioner unit’s cooling power is measured in British 
				Thermal Units or Btu per hour. One Btu can raise or lower the 
				temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. All 
				window air conditioners are rated by the maximum Btu/hr. Keep in 
				mind that even the smallest window air conditioners may have 
				thousands of Btu per hour. To keep these numbers is the proper 
				perspective; remember to compare the Btu between systems. 
				Generally, the more Btu, the larger an area the air conditioner 
				can cool. <br>
				<br>
				Another important factor is quietness. A window air conditioner 
				in a bedroom, for example, should be extremely quiet so that it 
				does not interfere with sleep cycles. The quieter air 
				conditioners are well insulated to minimize rattling when the 
				fan is running. A window air conditioner that has little support 
				– or that is not installed correctly -- also can rattle within a 
				window frame.<br>
				<br>
				Warranties also vary by a fair degree on all air conditioners. 
				Many manufacturers offer a 1-year full warranty, while some 
				offer a 5-year warrant to cover the air conditioner’s sealed 
				system or major components such as the condenser, evaporator, 
				fan and controls. Many have a 5-year limited warranty on the 
				condenser (no moving parts) and 1-year warranty on everything 
				else. A few models have in-home warranties, which mean the 
				manufacturer will send a service person to your home if there 
				are problems with your air conditioner, but these warranties are 
				not common.<br>
				<br>
				To summarise, there are four key questions you have to answer 
				before purchasing an air conditioner: <br>
				<br>
				<b>HOW BIG IS THE AREA YOU WANT TO COOL AND WHERE TO PLACE THE 
				AIR CONDITIONER? <br>
				</b>Air conditioners are rated in Btu capacity. For a small room 
				(100 to 300 square feet), select an air conditioner of 5,000 to 
				6,000 Btu/hr. For a medium-size room (300 to 600 square feet) 
				choose a unit of 8,000 to 9,000 Btu/hr. For larger rooms (600 to 
				1,000 square feet) the best choice is an air conditioner of 
				10,000 to 15,000 Btu/hr. These are guidelines. If the insulation 
				in your home is minimal or the air conditioner sits in a window 
				facing the sun for most of the day, opt for a unit with higher 
				Btu. <br>
				<br>
				Also remember that these calculations are for standard room 
				heights; if the room you are cooling has a taller ceiling, 
				you’ll need about 10 percent more Btu to adequately cool the air 
				in the room. If possible, avoid installing the cooling unit in a 
				window that gets lots of sunlight as it reduces the unit’s 
				efficiency. The same goes for split-units as well. Keeping the 
				outdoor unit in mostly shaded areas improves their efficiency. 
				Keep in mind that if you buy an air conditioner with a higher 
				Btu rating than you really need, it will cycle on and off too 
				quickly. This means it will use more energy, cost more to 
				operate and remove less humidity from the air, which is a key 
				factor here in Oman. Alternatively, if you use an air 
				conditioner with a low Btu to cool a too-large room, it will run 
				continuously and cost more to operate.<br>
				<br>
				<b>CAN AN AIR CONDITIONER DO MORE THAN JUST COOL A ROOM? <br>
				</b>Yes, some also act as dehumidifiers and some do double-duty 
				as heaters. Depending on where you live, humidity may be a 
				problem or a necessity. For arid summer climates, an air 
				conditioner with a built-in humidifier can add moisture to the 
				air to make the room more comfortable. For other areas, hot days 
				are exacerbated by humidity. An air conditioner with built-in 
				dehumidifier can remove moisture from the air. Some models can 
				also serve as heaters to warm the air if needed. This means that 
				they can stay in place year-round and serve multiple purposes. 
				Keep in mind what you require and purchase one that adequately 
				serves your purpose.<br>
				<br>
				<b>HOW IMPORTANT ARE CONTROLS? </b><br>
				Older window air conditioners were controlled by a single dial 
				that was set based on an estimate of the result: Set it most of 
				the way to the left, for example, to keep the room at as cool as 
				possible. Today’s air conditioners are much smarter; you can set 
				the temperature accurately and it will maintain the air 
				temperature within one degree of that point. For convenience, 
				many window air conditioners and nearly all split-units now have 
				wireless remote controls that let you change settings -- even 
				the direction of the airflow -- from across the room. Many units 
				even have timers to program the unit to start or shut off, so 
				you can set the AC to turn on just before you get home or turn 
				off when you go to sleep. Another important feature of most air 
				conditioners is the filtration system. Nearly all units have a 
				cleanable foam filter. Some use electronic air filtration to 
				remove dust and pollens from the air. Make sure that the 
				filtration system is adequate and easy to maintain. It’s 
				important to check that extra features, such as a heater or 
				dehumidifier, have adequate and easy-to-use controls. <br>
				<br>
				<b>WHAT IS YOUR COOLING BUDGET? <br>
				</b>How much can you invest in cooling a room? If the selected 
				room only gets hot during a couple of weeks in the summer, you 
				probably want to invest in a less expensive model. If the 
				cooling season is long and the room is frequently populated, you 
				should invest in a more expensive and more powerful unit. For 
				the most part though, considering our climate, investing in a 
				good air conditioner is never a bad idea.<hr color="#C0C0C0" size="1" width="95%">

				energy efficient<br>
				</font><br>
				A few handy tips to increase the life and improve the efficiency 
				of your air-conditioner.<br>
				</font></b><br>
				The maintenance of an AC is an area that most consumers and 
				commercial clients need to learn about. It is not always 
				necessary to order dealer service when a little bit of care and 
				maintenance on your part will go a long way in improving the 
				working life of your air conditioner. Simple things such as 
				regular cleaning of the filters, helps increase the life of your 
				AC. However, it is more prudent for you to enter into an annual 
				maintenance contract with the authorised service centre of your 
				brand of AC, so that the units are maintained at a nominal cost 
				with little hassle. The following few tips will help one 
				maintain an air-conditioner in an easy simple way:<p class="style15">
				Understand that an air conditioner, apart from cooling, also 
				conditions the air inside your room like humidity, dust, order, 
				fungus, bacteria, etc. All good quality ACs have cooling, 
				humidity control, dust removal, anti fungal and anti-bacterial 
				functions and these need to be used properly. Split ACs are now 
				affordable, very quiet and energy saving as compared to window 
				ACs. They are also more hygienic and prevent birds from making 
				their nests in air gaps, rodents creeping in and air from 
				leaking.<p class="style15">
				<br>
				Clean the filter of your AC once a fortnight, or when the 
				indicator lamp on the front panel lights up. Dirty air filters 
				force your system to work harder to push cool air through your 
				home. This uses more energy and places extra strain on the air 
				conditioning system. Take the filter(s) out and hold it to the 
				light. If the dust on the filter is so think that you can’t see 
				much light shining through the filter, it’s time for new 
				filters. A clean air filter, unobstructed by the dirt and other 
				debris, will save you money on energy costs and prolong the life 
				of your air conditioner. If you do not know where your air 
				filters are or how to replace them, ask your HVAC technician to 
				show you during an inspection.<br>
				<br>
				Keep the doors of your rooms open for a few minutes every day to 
				allow some fresh air to enter. Do not spray any type of 
				deodorant or perfume into your split ACs. Doing so will result 
				in foul smell, necessitating a cleaning of the indoor unit. 
				Avoid smoking in an AC room as indirect smoke can harm other 
				family members and it is very difficult to remove the odour even 
				by servicing.<br>

				For safety, always turn the thermostat and outdoor unit’s </b>
				</font><br>
				<font color="#808080">breaker off before doing any work around 
				that outdoor unit. The coil can be cleaned using a soft-bristle 
				brush to gently sweep the fins. Always brush in line with the 
				fins, and be gentle because the fins can bend easily. Because 
				the fan pulls air through these fins, you can expect to find 
				dust clinging to the fins. Removing this dust and other debris 
				will reduce resistance and increase efficiency.</font></td>

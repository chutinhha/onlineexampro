            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>As global tourism battles to recover from the slump following 9/11, Oman's hotels continue to under-perform. OER investigates why the local industry remains under pressure and what it's doing to bounce back</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To the delight of local residents and businessmen as well as world travellers who are
              'in-the-know', bargain room rates continue to thrive at Oman's luxury hotels. The spectre of war in Iraq has also begun exacting a toll on Middle East tourism reducing hotel occupancy rates and making matters worse for the local hospitality industry. In order to alleviate some fears that consumers may have had about travelling to the region, hotels slashed their average room rates by 4.6 per cent in 2002, according to a recent report by Deloitte &amp; Touche. This helped boost demand by 5.2 per cent from the levels in 2001. And the trend has continued in February
              2003.<br>
              Ultimately, the market's pricing tactics have cast the consumers as winners, explains Torbjorn Bodin, general manager of Radisson SAS Muscat. He says,
              "The room rates here in Oman are considerably cheaper than in other destinations."&nbsp;<br>
  The Sultanate's occupancy rates averaged 55 per cent among the four-star and five-star properties, while average rate in hotels was RO27 (US$70), according to a survey by TRI Hospitality Consulting in 2001.<br>
              In general terms, despite the fierce price competition, the relatively low occupancies and average rates don't necessarily indicate poor room revenues. To a degree this is offset by alternate sources of income such as from food and beverages, offering accommodation to aircrew and hosting conferences. However, there is (no doubt) concern in the market, especially when considering the very high quality properties like the Grand Hyatt and Al Bustan which are on offer. New properties including The Chedi may also be wary of the current situation. Hotel owners must be concerned that the aggressive pricing in the market is squeezing
              margins.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Slashing prices<br>
              </b>One immediate effect of a price war is a possible general deterioration of the product throughout the entire hospitality industry in Oman, says Guy Standish-Wilkinson, managing consultant, TRI Hospitality Consulting. He insists that any deterioration is exacerbated by the diminishing capital available for re-investment. In order to support the erosion of their revenues, they were forced to cut costs, inevitably leading to a reduction of service through lower manning levels, poor training and reduced marketing.&nbsp;<br>
              "Inevitably, there will be properties falling by the wayside - this has already been witnessed with the travel agents and the current price war over air tickets, where Omani agents are giving away increasing proportions of their ticket commission to keep the business," adds
              Standish-Wilkinson.<br>
              "The room rates in Muscat are miserable," remarks another hotelier.
              "It's ridiculous that guests can currently shop around and haggle with five-star hotels to the extent they do." The best profit margin is achieved from walk-in trade.
              "Occasionally guests who arrive will pay the rack rate. Usually these are customers who aren't aware of market conditions here," says another official from a local four-star hotel. He points out that rooms left unsold are considered lost revenue so a discounted rate is usually
              offered.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Be my guest<br>
              </b>In Muscat, hotel occupancies fluctuate significantly but they have never exceeded 52 per cent since 1993. Room rent from Oman's hotels and motels in 2000 was RO17.7 million (US$46 million) according to the Ministry of Development. In 2000, average occupancy for all hotels in Oman was 42 per cent reveals data from the Directorate of Tourism which also shows that international operators generally post better occupancy rates than independently run hotels.&nbsp;<br>
 The aforesaid figures hide the fact that some hotels fill their rooms successfully during the popular winter months.
              "While the average occupancy of hotels during the year may be around 55 per cent, during the high season this may reach 100 per cent and then come down to less than 50 per cent during the low season," notes a report by Ernst and Young.
              "This provides an opportunity for a good hotel which is efficiently managed to increase its market share and profit particularly during the low season."  It is expected that the average occupancy rate can therefore go much higher than the present
              rates.<br>
              The hotel industry's peak season in Muscat is November to March. The Directorate of Tourism believes that there is considerable potential to grow occupancy levels in months close the high season despite the hot climate. The government also observes that unless new hotel projects are initiated in the short term, demand may almost match supply during the peak
              season.<br>
              In 1999, Muscat had a total of 2,462 rooms in hotels rated as three-star and above. OER estimates that there is close to 3,000 rooms based on new luxury hotel openings and renovations. A recent tourism strategy report commissioned by the Directorate of Tourism suggested that Muscat should have at least 2,967 rooms available per day by 2005, and that 9,690 luxury rooms should be made available by 2020.<br>
              Today, the capital's 25 hotels that are three star and above provide over 75 per cent of hotel accommodation in Muscat. Self-contained apartments and budget hotels, motels and guesthouses capture the remaining market. Analysts are unanimous that the budget segment has less volatile room pricing and better occupancy as a result of lean purchasing power prevalent in the local
              economy.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Pricing problems<br>
              </b>Hoteliers say cut-throat competition in the luxury tourism segment has existed for many years. One senior official in the Directorate of Tourism told OER that a seminar was held at the end of last year suggesting solutions to the present pricing situation. An idea to enforce specific room rates for different categories of hotel was being championed. Such a scheme has already proved a success in Kuwait and
              Bahrain.<br>
              Hotel operators have revealed an 'academic' opposition to the agreement on the general principles that cartels encourage restrictive practices. In addition, some hotel operators predicted difficulty in the acceptance of such schemes by their organisation, headquartered in countries where such monopolistic practices are illegal.
              "While initially there were similar objections both in Bahrain and Kuwait, it is evident that it has not proved a major obstacle, and in fact operators are generally enthusiastic in their support of the scheme," reveals Standish-Wilkinson of TRI Hospitality. He says, in many ways, the figures speak for themselves. As per the regional comparison ranked by yield performance tabled below Oman is selling itself well short of its
              potential.<br>
              As you can see, the room yield and average room rates achieved in Oman are the lowest in the region. Bahrain and Kuwait that have implemented minimum rate policies, are maintaining room yields market-wide that are almost double those of Oman, despite comparable, or substantially lower occupancy rates, as in the case of Kuwait. Focusing on the hotels that are included in the minimum rate agreements in these two countries, the following table shows performance statistics for the five-star hotels in Muscat, Bahrain and
              Kuwait:<br>
              While the five-star sector in Oman achieved a better than average occupancy in 2001, it can be seen that the room yield is still considerably lower than comparative hotels in Bahrain and Kuwait. So, a minimum rate agreement clearly provides a framework to safeguard the minimum rates that hotels can charge through agreement of the hotel owners.<br>
              In addition, once the top level of hotels have a minimum rate, the other mid-market and budget hotels then automatically have a ceiling up to which they can then raise their freely-set rates, says Standish-Wilkinson. Therefore, the lowest rate agreements in Kuwait and Bahrain that apply only to the upmarket hotels effectively influence the complete stock of hotels there.<br>
              "At the initial stages, the agreements prevented undue rate erosion that was largely due to internal competition between the hotels in the face of stagnant demand, and helped combat the
              'discount' mentality among the buyers in the market," he adds.&nbsp;<br>
 The agreements have evolved over time and now hotels compete on quality and not simply on price. The resulting product improvement is of benefit to the destination as a whole. The correlation of this policy is that owners of disadvantaged hotels must invest in expanding or upgrading amenities, and improving service, in order to compete with equivalent hotels.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>   Head hunting<br>
              </b>Last month, the government tabled its second National Manpower Symposium. During the event, Manpower Minister HE Jumaa bin Ali Al Jumaa stated that hotels would need to increase Omanisation gradually to 75 per cent from current levels below 40 per cent. Hoteliers who had originally been asked to reach an Omanisation level of 95 per cent within six years are happier with the new figure. Most agree that the education system faces the sternest test to alleviate constraints in the tourism sector if the tourism industry is to grow successfully.&nbsp;<br>
 Robert MacLean, principal of the National Hospitality Institute (NHI) SAOG in Oman, says that there are good indications that jobs will be created as a result of business growth or natural replacement in the future. However, experts readily admit that it will be important to ensure proper induction procedures and development programmes are implemented and monitored if the profession is to remain healthy. One of NHI's main aims is to ensure that local industry receives employees who are well-trained and motivated and can satisfy customers at all times.<br>
              Last year, Oman Academy for Tourism and Hospitality was set up in Seeb by the government. It is state-run institute affiliated to the University of Administrative Studies in Austria offering specialisations in the management of tour and tourism offices, hotel management and tourism guidance. The first successful batch of students will obtain diplomas at the end of the academic year.<br>
              While hospitality, as a profession, generally has a high turnover of staff, Oman does not appear to have a problem and is used to virtually no significant labour movements. But as more enter the local industry, more may choose to leave.&nbsp;<br>
              "The industry has traditionally enticed young staff that are sometimes unsure of which career they want to follow. So naturally this has created a staff turnover. When you look at hotels in Oman, it is easier to retain staff here than many parts of Europe," adds Bodin of Radisson SAS
              Muscat.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Regaining confidence<br>
              </b>Although, the outlook for Oman's hotel market is uncertain, many local hoteliers are hopeful that the development of resorts such as Barr Al Jissah, will stimulate demand among leisure tourists improving general occupancy levels across the board. Others are optimistic that the hotel industry may have reached the bottom of the performance cycle, and, bar a protracted confrontation in Iraq, they are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the industry in the long term. However, a few warn that unless the pricing situation remains stable and room demand improves, Oman's hotels will simply cut costs and offer a poorer service to guests. Such a situation would alleviate fears that consumers will not be lured into staying (or worse prevent guests from returning) and damage a recovery in the hotel industry for owners, investors, operators, and developers alike.</font></p>

                            How green is my valley?</b></font>
                            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The hotel industry in Salalah is a mixed bag. It is an industry that was built on natural attractions and was expected to grow further based on man-made amenities. But just as Salalah's pleasant weather, archaeological sites and Khareef festival had started putting the Sultanate on the world tourist map, the impact of 9/11 and delays in certain major projects locally has left the hotel industry to survive on its
                            own.<br>
                            Salalah, which forms the main agricultural belt of the Sultanate, hosts the country's largest port facility - the Salalah Port Services
                            (SPS) SAOG. Added to this is the much-talked-about Salalah Free Trade Zone
                            (SFTZ) that has been prone to undue delays. Hoteliers cite the postponement of SFTZ as the main reason for the hotel industry to report moderate and, at times, descending growth; plus the woes continue for the industry owing to low tourists
                            turnout.<br>
                            Says Sayed Hassan, general manager, Crowne Plaza Resort Salalah (Holiday Inn
                            Salalah), "Even though there is a slight growth in tourism in the past two years during the Khareef (monsoon) season, the European tourism to Salalah (between October to April) has shown a downward trend mainly due to the uncertainties prevalent in the Middle East."<br>
 Striking a different note, Franz Josef Macho, general manager, Hilton Salalah explains that many hotel establishments, including Hilton, were built after the plan for constructing the SFTZ was conceived by the government.
                            "This newly created capacity within the hotel industry was supposed to largely service the corporate business originating from
                            SFTZ. However, the delay in this project has left hotel establishments to look out for new avenues," he
                            says.<br>
                            As far as business from SPS is concerned hoteliers have displayed mixed observations, but most of them do agree that a lot more needs to be done to ensure immediate and long-term growth of the city. Hassan of Crowne Plaza feels that the opening of SPS has not really contributed to any corporate business, whereas Macho from Hilton argues that SPS does generate good business, and stresses that (sometimes) corporate business has been exceeding than tourism.<br>
  To this, Jack Helton, chief executive officer of SPS, says that economic growth in Salalah is dependent upon immediate tourism development. He acknowledges that any further delay in the development of Salalah's free zone would have an adverse knock-on effect on the business in the city including that of SPS and hospitality companies. As part of the government's masterplan for
                            Dhofar, the free zone is intended to be created alongside other infrastructure projects such as Salalah Airport, he adds.&nbsp;<br>
 Talking about tourism, hoteliers opine that there is still a long way to go. One of the major hindrances facing the development of the tourism sector in Salalah is the non-availability of direct flights into the city. Passengers often have to take long transits at Muscat and airport, as many of them say, needs a drastic facelift. Hotels like Hilton, in order to avoid losing out on passengers, are offering tourists to spend a few days in Dubai, before coming down to
                            Salalah. "Lack of direct flights to Salalah from major European hubs and high airfares also contribute to the downward trend," says one source.<br>
 Industry players also suggest that hotels in Salalah cannot do much more than what they are already doing.
                            "What is required is development of more infrastructure facilities geared towards tourists in the Dhofar Region, like cable cars linking the mountains, public toilets, public transport, high quality mountain restaurants, direct flights from major European hubs and GCC destinations to
                            Salalah," says Hassan of Crowne Plaza.<br>
                            The efforts of the Directorate of Tourism towards promoting tourism do help in getting more tourists.  However, the hotels have to undertake their own promotions as these complement each other to achieve the overall goal of increasing tourism traffic to the Sultanate. Here also, hotels like Hilton benefit through their vast network (more than 2,400 establishments) across the globe, and Crowne Plaza, through the central reservation system of Six Continents promotes itself and the destination.<br>
 As far as the profile of guests is concerned, hotels receive guests mainly from other GCC countries during the Khareef festival. Most of them also receive guests from Europe (mainly from Germany). High-spending tourist is also on the move in Oman and hotels are seen upgrading their premises. And most of the hotels do make their own sales trips to various GCC countries for promoting the monsoon season in addition to tying up with airlines, tour operators and travel
                            agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

              <img border="0" src="xelibri.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="100" height="192">Siemens 
              has created a new collection of mobiles in radically different 
              shapes and wearable designs with simple voice functionality. The 
              move is intended to reinvigorate growth in the mobile phone 
              market. A new brand of XELIBRI accessories will be sold primarily 
              via department stores and fashion retailers. Just as fashion 
              accessories there will be spring/summer and fall/winter 
              collections. They will be sold initially in the UK, China, 
              including Hong Kong, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Spain 
              from April 2003, and in other markets from September 2003. With 
              mobile phone penetration rates in many markets at 70 to 85 
              percent, and overall growth stalled, the mobile phone industry 
              needs to be recharged, according to Siemens. Creating a new 
              category in the market and thereby building demand for multiple 
              phone ownership is an innovative step to achieve this. And at a 
              time where design is a top purchase criterion, the timing could be 
              right to introduce radically new designs. &quot;XELIBRI products are 
              fashion accessories that make phone calls. We envisage the 
              scenario where people will own many fashion accessory phones and 
              wear the one that matches their mood, the occasion, or their 
              attire,&quot; said George Appling, President of XELIBRI. <br>

              <b>Intel announces 'Wireless-Internet-On-A-Chip' </b><br>
              I<b><img border="0" src="tech-intel.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="150" height="214"></b>ntel Corporation last month announced a new cellular processor 
              that uses advanced &quot;wireless-Internet-on-a-chip&quot; technology. The 
              highly integrated microchip is the first to combine the key 
              components of today's cellular phones and handheld computers onto 
              a single piece of silicon - promising to bring advanced 
              functionality, longer battery life and more innovative phone 
              designs to mainstream phones. Called the Intel PXA800F cellular 
              processor, it is a key component of the Intel Personal Internet 
              Client Architecture (Intel PCA), Intel's development blueprint for 
              designing wireless handheld communication devices that combine 
              voice communications and Internet access capabilities. &quot;Intel's 
              ability to provide communications, computing and memory functions 
              in a single chip is unmatched in the industry and promises to 
              deliver outstanding performance, greater versatility and a richer 
              experience to cell phone users worldwide,&quot; said Hans Geyer, Intel 
              vice president and general manager of its PCA Components Group. 
              &quot;As the industry transitions from voice-only phones to advanced 
              devices that combine voice and data, the ability to effectively 
              and efficiently combine advanced processing, memory and 
              communications technologies will be required to drive the 
              next-generation of cell phones.&quot;<br>

                        Giga Information Group is forecasting a boom in overseas

                        grow by 25 per cent this year, as companies seek to cut 
                        costs and improve quality. IT outsourcing is when a

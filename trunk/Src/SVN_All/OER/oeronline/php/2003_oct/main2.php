            <font size="1" face="Verdana">This month, don't be surprised to see 
            some very beautiful models drive down the Muscat catwalk in the 
            ninth motoring show bonanza organised by Omanexpo LLC. Motor Show 
            2003, held between October 15 - 18 at the Oman International 
            Exhibition Centre, will, inevitably, be a great opportunity for car 
            enthusiasts, potential buyers, dealerships, accessory suppliers and 
            the rest of the auto market fraternity to get together and talk shop 
            ahead of Ramadan - a holy month when Oman's auto retailers offer 
            significant discounts and deals to customers. <br>
            Oman's car market is booming, according to insiders although there 
            are no official figures to verify these sentiments. The Sultanate's 
            automotive retail sector has been one of the fastest growing sectors 
            of the economy in recent years with a high increase in sales 
            levels,&quot; says one auto dealer. &quot;Successful exhibitions depend on the 
            demand for the products and services. The demographics and the 
            industrial potential of Oman's motor market look very promising.&quot;
            <br>
            According to estimates, the auto market has witnessed consistent 
            increases by between 8 - 12 % in the past five years and the number 
            of cars in use in Oman has risen to about 280,000 passenger cars and 
            170,000 commercial vehicles. Moreover, the car market high growth 
            potential shows little sign of slowing down.<br>
            In 1990, Omanexpo organised the Sultanate's first-ever 'Motor Show' 
            drew thousands of visitors and provided clients with the perfect 
            opportunity to preview new products, evaluate market trends and 
            establish long-lasting and commercially profitable partnerships. 
            Last year, over 25,500 visitors were recorded attending the event. 
            High profile visitors to the Motor Show 2002 included automotive 
            majors from across the world, their local representatives, car 
            designers, automotive engineers, finance companies, auto insurance 
            companies, fuel part suppliers, lubricant companies, pre-owned car 
            companies, wholesalers, retailers, senior government officials, the 
            press as well as the general public. As the event picks up extensive 
            coverage from both the Gulf and domestic press, the company predicts 
            much higher visitor numbers for the motor show this year. &quot;We can 
            expect an attendance of over 30,000 at Motor Show 2003,&quot; says CJ 
            Paul, General Manager of Omanexpo.<br>
            So what are the major attractions of Motor Show 2003 to car dealers, 
            car accessory companies and the general public?<br>
            Well, the major draw for exhibitors (essentially automobile 
            dealers), according to Omanexpo, is the fact that they can showcase 
            new automobiles to the general public. Although, perhaps more 
            importantly in the domestic market, the event serves as a platform 
            to build up sales interest ahead of the holy month of Ramadan when 
            automobile sales are at their peak. Automobile dealers continue to 
            view this show as a great opportunity in the Sultanate to gauge the 
            public reaction towards their latest launches at this crucial time 
            of the year when car sales peak. Omanexpo explain that the event may 
            also improve brand equity and generate greater awareness among the 
            general public about particular models.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Geared for more success</b><br>
            With over 18 years of show management experience, Omanexpo has 
            become one of the leading international exhibition organisers in the 
            region diversifying its operations in the GCC and having 
            full-fledged operations in Dubai Ð something, which it claims, gives 
            it a leading edge in the exhibition business. Each year, the 
            company, collects and compiles specific data relating to consumer 
            behaviour and attitudes towards the automobile sector. This in turn, 
            helps the automobile dealers to boost B-2-B and B-2-C activities in 
            the months ahead. <br>
            Notwithstanding, there are, of course, a number of benefits to the 
            general public of Motor Show 2003 as well. It is, after all, a 
            unique opportunity for visitors to view major automobile brands 
            under one roof as well as plan for the purchase of a vehicle and 
            involve the whole family in the selection process.<br>
            For auto accessories exhibitors, Motor Show 2003 is an ideal 
            platform to showcase their products, says Paul. &quot;Garage equipment 
            buyers and key officials from workshops and service centres will 
            visit the show - a vital target audience,&quot; he adds.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Wheels under one roof</b><br>
            But why does Oman need such an exhibition? &quot;The 'Motor Show' is an 
            established proven concept that is held practically the world over 
            in different countries,&quot; explains Paul. &quot;Over the years, the 
            automobile industry has witnessed an upsurge fuelled by the rapid 
            change in the design and development of automobiles. Presently, the 
            automotive sector in Oman is very competitive. Hence, Omanexpo 
            realised the need to provide the right platform to showcase 
            different automobiles from various parts of the world under one 
            roof. The 'Motor Show' was born.&quot; <br>
            The Motor Show 2003 is a four-day event commencing with the 
            inauguration on 15th October at the Oman International Exhibition 
            Centre. Top-level management, VIP's, senior government officials and 
            press delegates will attend the official inauguration, as always. 
            The morning session on the first day will be open to visitors 
            interested in trade and business. Trade visitors thus get a first 
            hand opportunity to negotiate business deals with different 
            automobile dealers. These include transport companies, buyers from 
            government departments, fleet owners, car hire companies, taxi 
            owners and others in transport business and commercial vehicles. An 
            exclusive morning is reserved only for ladies and families on 16th 
            October. <br>
            The other major highlights of Motor Show 2003 aside from the new 
            cars that will make their debut at the event will be the popular 
            participation of V-KOOL (a company that manufactures clear solar 
            heat control film that can be applied to car windows and rejects up 
            to 94 per cent infra-red radiation, which is the main cause of heat) 
            and the raffle draws (visitors can fill up entry forms for the 
            chance to win prizes), according to Omanexpo.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Future journeys</b><br>
            It certainly isn't the end of the road for Omanexpo, the pioneers of 
            exhibition and event management in the Sultanate, after Motor Show 
            2003. OER has struck a strategic partnership deal with the company 
            that will give OER readers a front seat to many exciting events 
            which Omanexpo is planning to stage later this year and 2004 
            including GCC Power 2003 Exhibition &amp; Conference in December, and 
            Oil &amp; Gas West Asia being held during April next year.</font></p>

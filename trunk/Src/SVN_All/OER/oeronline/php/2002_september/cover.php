                    <font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#FF0000">MSM - Bear in Bull's Clothing</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>That the Muscat Securities Market has remained largely unscathed despite a downturn in the global economy is an indication of a fundamental change in investor attitude in Oman. Uncertainty, however, prevails over the bourse's future performance, reports Paritosh Palav&nbsp;</b></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a four-year bearish run, the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) began 2002 with 1.5 per cent rise in its index, as investor confidence received a minor boost for two reasons. At first the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) announced the reduction in interest rates and eased off restrictions on personal loans, and at second, the government decided to increase state expenditure by two per cent in spite of volatility in the international oil market. A better organised and more transparent institution than earlier, the MSM, after eight months of diminutive bullish rallies, is today a place with improved trading practices.<br>
                    Factors like firm oil prices, stable economic growth, upcoming industrial projects, and infrastructure investments, seem to have instilled a sense of security among the investors. With a bottomed-out local market, Oman has managed to create some breathing space for itself, since - as financial experts suggest - it could be some time before the buyers return. Also, like most of the stock markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, MSM's performance has, to a large extent, remained subject to fluctuations in the global economy and sensitivity to oil prices and interest rates.<br>
                    Experts in the Sultanate argue that despite the growing confidence at MSM, it is still difficult to narrow down focus on factors that could drive the economy forward and place the market on a continuous growth curve. As it is, there is worry over the financial strengths of the companies listed at the MSM, and doubts about their ability to deliver higher profits in the future. Moreover, it is always tough for a market that had boomed and then crashed, to sustain an upward trend.<br>
                    In 1997, Oman's market was the best performer among those emerging in the Gulf. The downslide at MSM started in 1998 and continued until last year. Its performance at the end of 2001 indicated that the bourse registered a 24.4 per cent fall, with its main index touching 150 points. This contrasted with gains of similar percentage in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait. The UAE witnessed huge investments in building and infrastructure projects during 2001, while Kuwait benefited from foreign investments.<br>
                    Throwing light on issues pertaining to MSM's performance, A. Reguramalingam, Investment Manager, Bank Dhofar Al Omani Al Fransi, observes, "The MSM has a few limitations. The size of the trading volume is not that attractive, and it has less number of sound companies (with consistent performance). Drawbacks like these have made trading largely dependent on dividend yield rather than price."<br>
                    Market sources inform that in 1997, the large amount of money that fuelled MSM to unsustainable heights, came from the UAE. That money is now likely to remain in the UAE market, where prospects look much brighter. "With limited scope for capital appreciation, investors, particularly institutions, tend to hold on to stock," adds Reguramalingam.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The global connection</b><br>
                    Despite the better-than-expected performance of the MSM, it has been observed that the bourse seems to react to global economic and equity movements. The dip in the equity markets worldwide over the past few months, which touched new lows (not seen since September last year), sent a mild shockwave through all the GCC stock markets and not just MSM alone. Quite often, one comes across an Omani investor citing "downturn in global equity market" as the prime cause affecting the performance of the MSM index.<br>
                    Raghavan Murti, General Manager, United Finance Company, clarifies the situation by saying, "Stock markets are often driven by sentiments in addition to the fundamentals. A rise or fall in an important market abroad affects the sentiments in a local market, and to that extent the US market performance has a bearing on stock exchanges worldwide. The sentiment issues are short-term in nature and see correction very quickly."<br>
                    But can the MSM side step the recent global equity movements? Perhaps, but a fall in the oil prices would pose a major problem. Local investors have to ask themselves whether the downturn in international stock market prices will now affect the local market, or whether the local market will bypass international problems and maybe even gain at their expense. "A lot of capital is flowing back into the Gulf. Hence, investors are now turning more local than global," observes V. Ramakrishnan, Divisional Manager, Investment Banking Division, National Bank of Oman (NBO).<br>
                    Zoher Karachiwala, Chief Financial Officer, United Power Company (UPC), says, "The downturn in the leading stock markets worldwide has not made a big impact on MSM performance. However, the MSM is sensitive to global interest rate scenario."<br>
                    Interestingly, the MSM index rose by 24 per cent for the first half of the year 2002, which had declined by 24 per cent during the same period in 2001, whereas the Dow Jones index declined by 13 per cent and seven per cent during the corresponding periods.&nbsp;<br>
                    "There can be an indirect impact on MSM through the movements in oil prices, which has a dominant linkage between the local and world economies. Foreign direct portfolio investment (other than from Gulf countries) in MSM, which can have significant impact, is also very negligible," says Reguramalingam.&nbsp;<br>
                    Recent reports suggest that MSM, or for that matter GCC stock markets, are unaffected by the global bourses and continue to follow their own paths. They do tend to mirror the ups and downs of the oil market, which perhaps is a good forecaster of likely local stock market movements.<br>
                    "The Oman market is nascent. Frequent corrections are indicators that the market is maturing and the investors are being cautious," says Ajay Kumar, Assistant Manager, Investment Banking Division, NBO.&nbsp;</font></p>
                    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="1" src="../../images/2002_september/32-GRAPH.jpg"></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The market corrections</b><br>
                    In order to rectify the market operations, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) in Oman had taken a host of corrective measures over the past two and half years. While most of the measures were aimed at bringing in some market discipline, they were also expected to revive public confidence. Things like transparency, corporate governance and accounting standards were all that the market heard for the past few years.<br>
                    "The MSM is more transparent than before, as a consequence of which the investor confidence in the efficiency of the market has grown," says Karachiwala.<br>
                    "Unlike before, companies are increasingly adopting International Accounting Standards (IAS) and giving prominence to corporate governance. Following the MSM crash, the CMA and MSM have come down heavily on erring books," says Kumar of NBO.<br>
                    Steps like quarterly publication of results, capital adequacy for brokers, licensing guidelines and code of conduct for intermediaries, periodical publication of market trade statistics, reforms in settlement procedures and implementation of corporate governance guidelines - all have significantly helped in strengthening the confidence of the investors. "Although CMA has developed MSM into a market which fits in with international standards, there are many steps yet to be taken. Concepts such as futures and options are still a distant dream at MSM," avers Karachiwala.<br>
                    Striking a different note, Murti of UFC says that there is a need to evolve confidence building measures in relation to the local market and investors. "We have directly adopted norms from the US and UK markets. These norms have failed to protect investors in their own countries. Therefore, we should identify who our investor is - local, institutional, regional or foreign, and evolve regulations that are more investor and market friendly. The economy has to grow before you start controlling it," he says.<br>
                    But have any of these new rules and regulations really affected the investing pattern of the common man? To this, a financial expert in the market says that, while the institutional and high networth individual investors are well exposed to prudential requirements, it is better for the retail investor or common man to solicit the advice of investment managers or brokers to learn about the risk associated with any investment.<br>
                    Adding a new dimension to the issue of investment pattern, Hussain Al Raisi, Executive President, Al Amin Securities, says, "Economic stability and good corporate sector performance are factors enough to attract independent investors. In Oman, however, investors tend to buy scrips at high prices and miss out on opportunity in the first place."<br>
                    Ever since the boom conditions of 1997 and the subsequent fall in the market, it is generally felt that the level of perception among investors about investment risk and the need to observe prudential norms has improved.<br>
                    "Investment risk and prudential norms take a back seat during unusual boom conditions and get due importance only when the market corrects itself. Of course this is not unique to Oman; we see this happening even in the developed capital markets with decades of experience behind them," says Reguramalingam.<br>
                    "Earlier, the investors had too many issues to deal with and there was not enough transparency for the intermediaries. Now, they have a code of conduct that clearly mentions how they must operate. This would reduce the complaint levels from the customers and help provide quality service," says Ramakrishnan.<br>
                    Last year, MSM underwent a series of structural changes which saw many sick companies being placed into the third category. While these companies were largely declared as Ôtakeover targets', people complained that very little information about them was made available.<br>
                    Murti argues that it is not very clear as to what is expected about these companies. "What is the great idea in taking over a sick industry in the absence of any assistance package? All investors who bought into sick companies are regretting since these units are draining the resources of the new owners. Authorities must look at a structured programme to revive these companies as is done by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in India."<br>
                    Supplementing this observation, market analysts say that - all reforms and no incentives - does not provide a good balance. Companies too need incentives to enter into the market, especially when it is a small one (only 80 to 90 companies listed on MSM).<br>
                    Reforms backed with incentives such as tax relief are important. Incentives need to be reworked to protect the SAOG firms, which pay 12 per cent tax, while the LLCs pay 30 per cent tax on a progressive basis, feel the analysts.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Market performance&nbsp;</b><br>
                    The MSM index, which is largely dominated by the banking sector, witnessed a considerable amount of growth in the insurance, finance and services sector this year. Analysts forecast that these sectors are expected to maintain the good performance for the rest of the year, and that the index could well rise by another two to three per cent.&nbsp;<br>
                    In sharp contrast, Murti hopes that nothing goes wrong (with MSM) in a big way. He feels that the MSM must find ways to attract larger market segments like automobile dealers, construction companies and oil companies to get listed. "At present MSM reflects a very small fraction of local economy."<br>
                    Sharing a similar view Dinakar Rao, Manager - Finance &amp; Research, Al Shalman Securities, says, "The services sector is an important ingredient in the economy, but how many companies do we have in this sector? Globally, an evolution has taken place in the stock markets, and it is the services sector that has added to market capitalisation."<br>
                    The CMA has recently changed the composition of MSM index giving due weightage to the financial performance of the companies (forming part of the index) and the trading volume of the shares of these companies.<br>
                    "The present system adequately ensures that the index remains the barometer of the economy," says Reguramalingam.&nbsp;<br>
                    Moreover, the GCC members' drive to form an economic bloc might see the advent of a single bourse in the region, which would help broad base the market and adequately address all these issues. There are proposals to cross-list the securities among the exchanges. But such a proposal may not be a practical solution as long as the regional exchanges continue to function individually.<br>
                    According to Sadiq Mohammed Khaliq, Senior Manager and Head of Brokerage, BankMuscat, the yield that you can now get on your investments (about eight to 12 per cent annually) is better than deposits in banks, which fetch hardly one to two per cent.<br>
                    "The daily volumes at MSM have also increased to an average of RO750,000 this year, sometimes even exceeding RO1 million, as compared to RO50,000 to RO200,000 earlier," says Khaliq.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Future uncertain</b><br>
                    The unexpected hike in oil prices (to US$25 per barrel this year) has been the driving force behind the upturn in stock prices at MSM. There have been other factors as well. Reforms are moving forward, and local investors have hardly any alternatives for investment other than the MSM.<br>
                    Therefore, provided oil prices hold up in the second half of the year, MSM will see increased investments and thus gain value. However, if the global economy gets into greater difficulty, then local investors could take a pause to assess what is going on, and that might well extend the summer slowdown.<br>
                    As for international bourses, local investors have shrugged off the global slump in equities. Generally the feeling is that low interest rates will continue to boost the local economy, and as the Sultanate exports mainly oil to the US, its exposure to an economic downturn is minimal. Only if an economic collapse were to impact the oil prices, as opposed to a stock market slump, would MSM investors be required to run for cover.<br>
                    Local shares thus seem to be a safe investment in the difficult global equities market. They also offer better dividends than deposit accounts with the additional prospect of capital growth. Traditionally, shares at MSM are also cheaper than in the global markets.<br>
                    Maybe we have already seen all the action in MSM equities for this year. The oil sector has been anticipating a global economic recovery. If that does not come about, then oil prices will track lower and cause MSM share prices to fall. Meanwhile, investors are waiting for the Q3 results of the companies, which can also impact the fate of the market.</font></p>

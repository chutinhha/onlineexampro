<b>The real estate market in the Middle East is on a roll with buyers from all 
over the world heading to own a piece of this golden region. A look at what 
makes this region tick<br>
</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="advertorial.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="95" height="141">Researches by international real estate agencies and experts in the past few 
years have all come to the same conclusion – the Middle East has one of the 
fastest growing property markets in the world. Many countries have been hit by 
the current global economic crisis and real estate markets too have been facing 
a slight slump. But the Middle East has proved to be an exception.<br>
<br>
Dubai leads the pack as the area where development is taking place at a rapid 
pace. Following closely behind are Bahrain, Qatar and Oman. What impresses 
potential and current buyers in these regions is the sustainable growth factor. 
The amazing regularity with which new projects are being unveiled also has 
investors convinced of the region’s potential. The Middle East is the new 
address not only for homes but for offices as well. The region is now the new 
vacation home for those who’ve bought summer houses in France and Greece. 
Offices of huge conglomerates that conducted business mainly in Europe and the 
US have also set up businesses in the region. So what is it that makes this 
region tick? What are the factors that make the Middle East the favorite of 
property investors?<br>
<b>Bourgeoning, investor-friendly environment:</b> Almost all the regions in the Middle 
East are on the path to enormous economic growth. Even those markets that were 
earlier closed or cautious about foreign participation in business have now 
opened their doors. Increased disposable income is also making the region a 
lucrative emerging market.<br>
<br>
<b>Availability of land:</b> Since most regions in the Middle East have been 
experiencing sustainable growth only in the past decade or so, land is still 
available in abundance. This has spurred the rapid development of the region’s 
property market. Developers also find that procuring land is not very difficult 
especially since the governments in many of the Middle Eastern countries are 
open to giving large expanses of land for the purpose.<br>
<br>
<b>Ownership rights: </b>Many changes have been made in property ownership rules over 
the past few years in the Middle East. Citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) can freely buy property in any/all GCC country(ies). (GCC comprises 
Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE.) Countries like Morocco, 
Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon are liberal to foreign ownership but have 
regulatory procedures to follow. Foreigners are allowed freehold ownership in 
Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and UAE in selected areas.<br>
<br>
<b>Low property prices: </b>The Arabian property market is still at a nascent stage 
compared to elsewhere in the western world. So, land and property prices are 
comparatively less, which makes it feasible for buyers, especially those from 
developed regions.<br>
<br>
<b>Higher rents:</b> For many property stakeholders rental yields from the Middle East 
has proved to be higher than in many other countries. While increased prices and 
inflation in many countries in Europe have led to a fall in rental yields, it’s 
been the opposite in the Middle East. The taxation rules have also proven to be 
favorable for the stakeholders. </font></p>

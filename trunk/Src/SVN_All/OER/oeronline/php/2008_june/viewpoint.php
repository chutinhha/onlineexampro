Oman Economic Review<br>

bye, Your Excellency!</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>South Africa’s ambassador to Oman is exiting but he has set in motion a lot of 
bilateral initiatives which is putting Oman upfront in South Africa’s worldview</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="viewpoint2.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="200" height="126">Come July, the chief resident of Way No. 3017, House No 1384, Al Shatti Qurum, 
Oman’s diplomatic area, will be in a different land. After a five-year stint, 
serving South Africa’s interests in the Sultanate, His Excellency Yacoob Abba 
Omar is set to take up a fresh assignment in the neighbourhood, Abu Dhabi, to be 
precise. <br>
The 47-year old South African envoy, a non-career diplomat, is busy saying 
goodbye through customary calls on government officials, peer groups and the 
hordes of friends he made during his eventful tenure in the Sultanate.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me, my table is not tidy,” says the salt-and-pepper bearded, history and 
politics major from the land of Nelson Mandela. He is dressed in casuals – a 
striped white full sleeves shirt teamed with black trousers and a black jacket, 
no necktie and we are seated in his spacious study littered with the customary 
diplomatic knick-knacks: President Thabo Mbeki’s photo on the wall, a miniature 
South African flag tucked on a stand, and a group photo of himself along with 
his staff. There is also a scattering of African artefacts. The soon-to-be 
former Ambassador didn’t anticipate my request to use his work desk as a prop 
for my notepad and hurries away from the cushy comfort of his sofa to clear the 
desk and ‘prepare the ground’ for me so to speak.<br>
<br>
<b>Colourful Past</b><br>
His endearing smile and engaging demeanour hides his action-packed past. How 
many of us know that Omar had gone into exile for five years in 1985 under 
instructions from his bosses in the African National Congress (ANC)? Again, how 
many of us are aware that he underwent military training in Angola, Mozambique 
and Zimbabwe? Similarly, do we know that he studied dialectic materialism et al 
in Moscow? A tough man, indeed. But his outward appearance gives little away. 
Omar is a diplomat after all. <br>
<br>
Before being dispatched to Oman as South Africa’s envoy, His Excellency served 
on the Political Military Committee, a strategic body of the ANC besides 
managing the political outfit’s information and publishing affairs back home 
between 1990 and 1994. Subsequently, he was appointed Deputy Head of 
Communication under President Nelson Mandela, a post he occupied till 2001. For 
the next two years, Omar was engaged in his own business, communication.<br>
<br>
<b>Charter of Demand</b><img border="0" src="viewpoint.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="149" height="172"><br>
“My brief, before emplaning for Oman, was clear: Establish an Embassy; 
strengthen political relationship; and improve bilateral trade.” Setting up the 
diplomatic office to represent South Africa was not a challenge as he is 
methodical and organised. ‘What is the meaning of ‘strengthening political 
relationship’?’, I ask. “In diplomatic parlance, it means advancing the number 
of bilateral agreements, increasing senior-level traffic between two nations 
thereby enlarging business opportunities,” he explains. <br>
<br>
During his tenure, Omar has done a lot for his motherland. Nonetheless, there 
are a few ‘disappointments’. “I wanted the Partnership Forum Agreement to be 
signed before I left Oman. It is in its closing stages, but I won’t be here when 
it happens,” he says. What’s so great about this agreement? “This will 
ultimately lead to the setting up of a Joint Commission – a higher level of 
engagement between two nations,” he says. <br>
<br>
Another item on the verge of materialising is an agreement to promote and 
protect investment in both countries. <br>
<b><br>
Glorious Engagement</b><br>
His 
Excellency is proud that the engagements between Pretoria and Muscat over the 
past five years have been excellent. South Africa’s ministers of foreign 
affairs, defence and higher education visited Oman. Similarly, the Sultanate’s 
ministers of oil and gas, foreign affairs, legal affairs, higher education and 
tourism have visited his home country. Not to be missed out were visits by 
several delegations from South Africa’s nine-strong provincial governments.<br>
 <br>
Nelson Mandela visited Oman in 1998 and His Excellency is confident His Majesty 
Sultan Qaboos bin Said will visit South Africa in the near future. According to 
him, political relationships are important. “Why? Because you need each other 
when you pursue certain common goals. Both our nations share common perspectives 
on a variety of issues, including peace in the region. Oman’s is an effective 
voice in the global diplomatic arena and one can never underestimate the 
efficacy of its quiet diplomacy,” points out the South African envoy.<br>
<br>
<b>Business, Business</b><br>
What about trade relationship? “It’s booming… Half a billion dollars is what it 
is worth now,” he says. South Africa sees huge potential in ties with Oman, and 
a trade delegation is expected to visit the Sultanate in October. How effective 
are such visits? “It works. Businessmen meet businessmen, and business is 
generated, - both ways,” he says. Given South Africa’s competence in mining, 
Pretoria is keen to assist Muscat in this sector. South Africa is equally ready 
to assist in the gas and coal sectors, both in the technology and governance 
areas. Agreements in these areas are near finalisation.<br>
 <br>
It’s getting late and is near closing time for the Embassy on this hot and sunny 
May afternoon. As we get ready to part for the last time, perhaps in Oman, I 
recall my first meeting with Omar a few years ago: His Excellency in his 
colourful and collar-less, light cotton African shirt. Today, he is different. A 
lot has happened over these years. As he escorts us to the door, I ask him what 
he considers as his crowning glory in Oman? He guffaws and responds with his 
trademark smile: “A lot more people in Oman now know where South Africa is.” <br>

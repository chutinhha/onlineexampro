<br>
You live and you learn,” says Abeer Al Jasmi, Head of Professional 
Qualifications at Knowledge Horizon Training Institute. “At least, that’s our 
experience. We find that the uptake on our courses for professional 
qualifications is exceeding anything we had anticipated.”<img border="0" src="e-learning_1.jpg" width="196" height="254" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6"><br>
<br>
A recent Economist Intelligence Unit survey found nine out of 10 top executives 
rating business prospects over the next few years as being good or very good. 
Dynamism in emerging markets is the main reason for this optimism, with a 
majority of the 1,006 executives surveyed planning to invest more in developing 
countries rather than in developed economies. What is however, checking them is 
their concern for the shortage of talent and the lack of quality professional 
business training in emerging markets, despite the large numbers of students 
graduating each year. They say that a relatively low proportion has the 
necessary skills required by global firms, and that competition for those that 
do is intense.<br>
<br>
Al Jasmi agrees: “People want quality from their training and that’s what we 
offer. But the demand is clearly driven by global trends. There’s a great deal 
of investment going on in the region and the price of oil is at an all-time 
high. That’s creating a lot of employment opportunities but a relatively low 
proportion of people actually have the professional skills that are required and 
as we get more and more international, investors’ demand in the Sultanate for 
professional training is only going to grow. What’s more, many people these days 
are finding that having a degree or a basic qualification is just not enough. 
There’s a move to upgrade qualifications to get promotions, change jobs, to 
acquire more professional credibility and respect in the workplace or, in some 
cases, simply for professional satisfaction.”<br>
<br>
<b>Meeting demand<br>
</b><br>
The demand for training will surely increase as the economy prospers. With 
growing numbers of young Omanis entering the job market every year, this surely 
is an ideal opportunity for employment. But how are these new recruits going to 
be trained? While many training institutes and colleges do an excellent job, do 
they really have the capacity to deal with the demand? Studying abroad might be 
one answer, but desirable as the qualifications are, it is not always practical 
and certainly the cost can be a major obstacle. <br>
<br>
Al Jasmi agrees saying, “Currently, local institutes do not have the capacity to 
deal with training in the kind of numbers that will be needed and it really is 
not cost-effective to send all of them overseas to train. But there is a 
solution. E-learning is an ideal tool. At Knowledge Horizon, we really see this 
as a major factor in training. It will make more courses available to more 
people and more economically – it saves money without cutting corners. What’s 
more, e-learning can be more easily integrated into on-the-job training than 
conventional courses, and more easily adapted to specific needs. And let’s face 
it, this kind of learning is more engaging to younger generations that have 
grown up with Playstations and Gameboys.” Al Jasmi’s observations were supported 
by Economist Intelligence Unit reports that suggest early investment in 
e-learning has been mainly based on maximising cost-efficiencies and 
effectiveness.<br>

Back in 1999, John Chambers, President and CEO of Cisco Systems, had said, “The 
next big killer application for the internet is going to be education. Education 
is going to make e-mail usage look like a rounding error.” Certainly, Cisco has 
put its money where its mouth was and invested heavily in e-learning. Worldwide, 
however, e-learning has had a disappointing ride and produced varying results, 
with many e-learning providers themselves experiencing a steep learning curve.
<br>
<br>
“The use and scope of technology to replace or supplement the classroom approach 
has been growing steadily, but it’s not a runaway train by any means,” says Pat 
Galagan, Executive Editor at the American Society for Training and Development. 
However, a survey in October 2007 by UK-based training provider CCH Professional 
Development, reported in Accountancy magazine, found a big shift towards online 
continuous professional development (CPD). In fact, as many as 30 per cent of 
the accountants they surveyed had shunned traditional face-to-face training for 
compulsory CPD commitments, specially because of the time they could save 
through e-learning. These findings are backed by figures from the International 
Data Corporation, which estimates that RO20m will be spent on e-learning in 
Singapore in 2008, a three-fold increase <br>
since 2004.<br>
<br>
<b>Global shift<br>
</b><br>
E-learning is also thriving in the US. The research report, Growing by Degrees: 
Online Education in the US 2005, published in November 2006, gives a very 
positive outlook on online education. It says that online enrolment in the US 
increased from 1.98 million in 2003 to 2.35 million a year later, a growth rate 
more than 10 times that had been predicted by the National Center for Education 
Statistics for general post-secondary student population. On top of that, 
figures show that 65 per cent of US universities offering graduate face-to-face 
courses also offer online courses. A national survey in Australia also shows 
that 85 per cent of teachers and trainers in vocational education and training 
(VET) system are using e-learning.<br>
<br>
So why the upsurge in e-learning, specially after many were saying its role had 
been overestimated? Al Jasmi has her own ideas: “Mainly, I think on-line 
learning has become more realistic, it’s more mature – it has come of age if you 
like. People in the business are learning from the mistakes they made in the 
early days. For me, the big difference is the change in how e-learning is 
approached. It was too rigid before. Today, there’s more imagination applied to 
how things are done as technology is much more flexible. In the beginning, it 
tried to replicate the classroom experience too much. But now we use everything 
from SMS messages to synchronous and asynchronous video conferencing, podcasts, 
you name it and you don’t have to conform to a traditional curriculum with 40 
minute or 60 minute lessons. In fact, we tend to go for much shorter bites – say 
20 minutes or so, making it easier for folks to fit the learning into their 
working day.<br>
<br>
Another important development is that now e-learning doesn’t imply the absence 
of other humans. There’s more of a trend towards blended learning and let’s not 
forget the importance of e-communities – there’s lots of support out there. Many 
people embarking on e-learning courses have grown up with computers and are a 
lot more comfortable with them. Although I have to say that Internet penetration 
still has a long way to go and as this increases, it will make a big difference. 
And here’s something to think about – many of us have already taken the first 
steps in e-learning. Every time we do a Google search or look something up 
on-line, for example, on the Wikipedia, every time we use the computer to try 
and find something out, then we’re taking the first steps in e-learning all on 
our own.” <br>

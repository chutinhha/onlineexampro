<b>The Sultanate’s tradition of enterprise dates back over centuries, we profile 
six entrepreneurs who are keeping that spirit alive</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="indepth1.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="200" height="162">The importance of entrepreneurs in a growing economy can hardly be overstated – 
from job creation to wealth generation they fulfill a variety of roles. The 
opening up of sunrise sectors such as tourism, financial services, real estate, 
hospitality and exports is throwing up a host of opportunities for people who 
have the drive and ambition to succeed. The road to success, however, is paved 
with hardships and challenges. Here are some entrepreneurs who have walked that 
path and emerged triumphant. <br>
<b><br>
Ali Hassan Sulaiman<br>
Director, Ali &amp; Abdul Karim Group</b><br>
As an entrepreneur you need to have courage, positive thinking and gut 
instinct.” Ali Hassan Sulaiman for one has all of these qualities in ample 
measure. He started AATCO with his brother Abdul Karim Hassan Sulaiman in 1987 
with next to nothing. Today he has built AATCO into a $30mn a year business. 
Eighty-five per cent of the company’s turnover comes from exports. This speaks 
volumes about AATCO’s efficiency and quality standards. “We have always been 
very export oriented as you cannot expand a business beyond a point in Oman due 
to the limitations of the market,” says Sulaiman.<br>
<br>
AATCO was the first company in the region to become a supplier of food products 
to Burger King, a multinational company. Orders from the likes of Yum! Brands 
(owner of KFC and Pizza Hut) soon joined the list. “Unlike trading and services 
a manufacturing business needs unbridled passion as it requires constant 
upgradation and enhancements,” says Sulaiman.<br>
<br>
In the late 1990s he replicated his success with AATCO in Al Khaleej 
Polypropylene Products (AKPP). Sensing a gap in the BOPP market in Oman, he set 
up AKPP. The company was sold in 2007 to Taghleef Industries, the regional 
leader in this field. “Our philosophy is to constantly add value to a business. 
Even when we exit a business we want to see it succeed further,” he says.<br>
<br>
Sulaiman prides himself on being a pioneer in training in Oman – a small 
initiative which started in 1988-89 with the aim to impart English language 
skills later on grew into National Training Institute (NTI) and National 
Hospitality Institute (NHI). Over the years, these institutes have trained 
25,000 people. <br>
<br>
If he has had a great deal of success, Sulaiman has also been through some 
trying times. In 2005 a fire at the AKPP plant in Sohar resulted in a RO11mn 
loss. After ensuring the safety of their staff, the management acquired a plant 
in Egypt to address customer needs and production at the Sohar plant was 
restored in 15 days. <br>
An aborted construction and toy store business in the mid 1980s led him to take 
up a job at Commercial Bank. “I have been through sleepless nights trying to put 
things together. When you face a setback you need to cut your losses and move 
forward,” says Sulaiman.<br>
<br>
<b>Lessons along the way</b><br>
“I believe in sharing my experiences and success with others as it helps in 
guiding and mentoring others. When you give away you end up getting back more. 
Think big and think beyond Oman. Entrepreneurs can be created with the right 
training and upbringing.” <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Saud Hamed Al Zakwani<br>
Chairman, United Dates Factory Company</b><br>
Zakwani has changed the face of the traditional dates business with his acumen 
and foresight. First, sensing the need to upgrade packaging from the traditional 
baskets, he introduced plastic bags and cardboard cartons. In an effort to make 
the fruit more hygienic new technology was installed to wash and fumigate dates.
<br>
To encourage farmers to grow good quality dates United Dates started giving 30 
per cent of the price of the expected yield upfront. To improve quality at 
source Zakwani started the process of selecting dates for purchase instead of 
the traditional system of buying them pre-packed. The gains for farmers too have 
improved as instead of paying them RO120 for a basket as earlier the company now 
pays them RO400. “We ensure that farmers are committed to us and this has helped 
us to procure more dates than any of our competitors. Improved pricing is also 
an incentive for them to cultivate date trees,” says Zakwani. A date tree takes 
five to six years to grow but once it matures into a tree its lifespan can be 
anywhere between 50 to 70 years. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="indepth2.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="200" height="152">A great votary of making the business a win-win situation for everyone involved, 
Zakwani is constantly on the look out to add value to the value chain. The 
company used to sell dates in bulk packages of two to ten kilograms. To make the 
product more consumer friendly, United Dates introduced consumer packs in the 
last two years. In an effort to brand its product the company has introduced its 
Golden Dates brand.<br>
<br>
The company is looking at introducing value added products like date syrups and 
pastes, which have a variety of uses. The results speak or itself: Starting out 
with RO100,000 in 1991, United Dates turnover in 2007 stood at RO2.75mn. Staring 
out from a farm in Romesh with a 15 member team, the company now operates out of 
an 850 square metre factory in Ghala industrial area with a staff strength of 
65. The company exports to India, Malaysia, Africa, Japan and the UAE. It has 70 
per cent share of the export market and 60 per cent share of the local market. 
It won His Majesty’s cup for the best factories in 2007. <br>

<b>Lessons along the way</b></font><br>
“An entrepreneur should have the right thinking and be consistent. The best way 
to grow is to join hands with others to help them grow. He should share his 
wealth with others.”<br>
<br>
<b>Mustafa Ahmed Salman<br>
Chairman &amp; CEO, United Securities</b><br>
<img border="0" src="h.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="250" height="156"><b>Hassan Ali Jawad</b><br>
Managing Director, United Securities<br>
The success of United Securities lies in the promoter’s ability to visualise the 
future and to go against the grain. It began with Mustafa Salman’s decision to 
trade in his job at the ministry of sports in 1989 for the position of finance 
manager at ‘Oman Securities Portfolio’, a brokerage firm. “People would say why 
are you leaving a secure job to join a securities firm. But we read the 
potential of the market.” It was at the brokerage firm that Salman learnt the 
ropes of the securities business. This came in handy when he floated Mustafa 
Ahmed Salman Partners and Associates in 1994. It started with a 70 square metre 
space in the MSM and four employees. In 1996 the company was rechristened as 
United Securities. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="bb.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="200" height="237">The company started off as the No. 8 broker on the MSM with a seed capital of 
RO100,000. “Our target was a turnover of RO20,000 a day. It was a stiff target 
and we realised that it would be difficult for us to achieve,” says Jawad. The 
company struck beginners luck and started making profits from day one. In its 
second year of operations it became the No. 6 brokerage company. Its meteoric 
growth predicated the need for more hands and Jawad who was associated with 
United Securities in a part time capacity joined the company in 1998. <br>
<br>
But the company soon hit its first roadblock – the MSM crash of 1998 saw United 
Securities make its first loss since inception. Undeterred, the two partners 
decided to go against the norm. “As all brokers started making losses and 
retrenching people, we decided to recruit people,” says Salman. <br>
<br>
The bursting of the US technology bubble in 2001 saw the MSM volumes plummet 
further. A strong belief that the drop was cyclical kept the two going. To 
diversify its income stream the company forayed into research and asset 
management and further innovations. In 1997 it went into research and in 2000 
asset management. This was followed up the same year by a foray into corporate 
finance and private placement deals. The business model changed from being a 
securities firm to an investment house. Despite such odds the two partners have 
adhered to a few givens – what ever profits were made was left in the company. 
This enabled them to increase the share capital of the company from RO100,000 in 
1994 to RO500,000 in 2000. The inclusion of new partners in 2007 saw this 
increase to RO6.5mn. The promoters have never leveraged the company to make a 
fast buck as this could endanger the well-being of their staff and clients. And 
finally, they have kept their personal portfolios out of the company’s fold. <br>
<br>
Looking back, all this has paid off in a big way. United Securities has grown at 
a faster pace than the market. The company today enjoys a 26 per cent 
marketshare in terms of traded volumes. It has been a pioneer in the Sultanate’s 
markets in a number of ways. It was the first company to introduce a website 
helping clients to see their statements and portfolio in 1997, the first company 
to introduce an SMS service for customers in 2005 and the first to introduce 
online trading (on the new MSM trading platform) in 2007.<br>
<br>
<font color="#CC3333">
<b>Lessons along the way</b></font><br>
“The two things that are important in a business are ethics and commitment and 
one should not be in a hurry to make a quick buck,” says Jawad. Adds Salman, 
“Providing the right valuation of the market (stocks) and investing in the right 
people has given us an edge.” <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Hassan Ahmed Jawad Ghuloom<br>
CEO, Al Waqia Shoes</b><br>
<img border="0" src="ah.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="168" height="182">Al Waqia Shoes closed the year 2007 with a turnover of RO2mn. Now, the company 
has set its sights on crossing RO2.5mn in 2008. These milestones, though, have 
not been achieved by sudden flight. Ghuloom’s entrepreneurial journey has been 
marked by spectacular success and equally spectacular failures. He started off 
in 1996 with the manufacture of safety boots for workers in industrial sectors. 
Ghuloom faced an early set back when a UK based company which had promised to 
sell 50 per cent of the company’s merchandise reneged on its commitment. If that 
was not bad enough his products were soon becoming obsolete in the European 
market due to a change in technology. <br>
<br>
To salvage the situation, Ghuloom turned his attention to the regional market 
and was successful in selling his “obsolete” products in this part of the world 
simply because the upgraded products in Europe had not reached this region till 
early 2002. But this was not good enough – by 2001 the company’s initial capital 
of RO750,000 had been wiped away. The company was on the verge of closure owing 
to a lack of capital. A strong faith in the product and his self belief though 
kept Ghuloom going. <br>
<br>
Things started to turnaround in 2002, as Al Waqia boots were approved and 
endorsed by the Ministry of Defence for its personnel. Being a high margin 
product, the sale of Waqia Shoes could recover the losses within two-and-half 
years. Defence authorities in Bahrain and Qatar also began sourcing Al Waqia 
boots. The company fulfills almost 90 per cent of the military requirements in 
Oman. This was a new era of growth for Al Waqia Shoes and its success story 
perhaps starts from here. At this juncture, the company invested about half a 
million rial into a cutting edge technology called Direct Injection Machine. It 
now started exhibiting its products at almost all the major exhibitions of 
safety products in the world. Waqia now had more designs in its repertoire. A 
designer was hired in India to fashion new brands of Waqia safety shoes. <br>
<br>
Waqia has positioned itself at the heart of 18 export markets some of which are 
GCC, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Kazakstan and Australia. 
Since 2007, Waqia has stepped into Europe, where the majority of the boots are 
sold to the manufacturing industry. SATRA, a UK shoe-quality certification body 
qualifies Waqia safety shoes to the European market. <br>
<br>
The company’s sales in 2005 were 230,000 pairs, in 2006, it reached 260,000 
pairs. In 2007, Waqia sold about 62,000 pairs more than the previous year. The 
company has set its sight on growing by 10 – 15 per cent within a few years. “We 
hope to cross 400,000 pairs by the end of this year,” says Ghuloom. Military 
boots may be 5 per cent of that sale. <br>
In the last three years the company has averaged a growth of 33 per cent. The 
company’s exports to GCC countries, Tunisia, Syria, Jordan, Morocco and 
Kazakhstan have increased from 65 per cent of the total safety boots production 
in 2005 to about 70 per cent in 2007. For last three years, Waqia Shoes was 
honoured as the five best factories in Oman.<br>

<font color="#CC3333">Lessons along the way</font></b><br>
“One should have the ambition to get to the top and the creativity or a desire 
to do things his own way. One should remain positive and should learn from 
failures. An entrepreneur should be a leader and not just a manager. A leader 
being a person who can guide others, while a manager is a person who can do 
things.” <br>
<br>
<b>Hassan Mohamed Habib<br>
Assistant Director General, Mazoon Pharmacy</b><br>
<img border="0" src="indepth5.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="200" height="116">The pharmaceutical business in Oman has its own set of challenges like dealing 
with internationally established principals, low margins and price control. 
Hassan Mohamed Habib of Mazoon pharmacy has not just negotiated these challenges 
for over 35 years, but has built up the pharmacy chain into a name to reckon 
with in the pharmaceutical business.<br>
<br>
Joining the business in 1973, he started working on strengthening the company’s 
relationship with pharmaceutical majors. “I visited a number of principals and 
entered into exclusive distributorship contracts with them in the early years,” 
says Habib. Some of these were Glaxo, Ciba-Geigy and Leo pharmaceuticals.<br>
<br>
Dealing with such principals at times creates its own set of problems – such as 
in 2005 when Glaxo and Burrows Welcome merged with Smithkline Beecham, the 
agency for Glaxo shifted from Mazoon Pharmcy to Muscat Phramacy as the latter 
represented the other three brands – SmithKline, Beecham and Burrows in the 
Sultanate. <br>
<br>
Pricing in the trade has also come under pressure over the years. Most 
principals have reduced their commission from 15 per cent to 12 per cent, “This 
has been compensated by an increase in volumes,” says Habib. The government’s 
decision to introduce price controls has further squeezed margins. “The 
government has mandated that a pharmaceutical product can only have a 22 per 
cent profit in the retail trade,” says Habib. The government’s decision to go in 
for generic formulations for its bulk purchases has also been posing a threat to 
its business as most of its formulations are from original manufacturers.<br>
<br>
Habib has negotiated these landmines with tact and finesse. A compliance with 
the exacting standards set out by principals has seen Mazoon pharmacy retain a 
number of its internal partners. Leo has been with the company for 35 years, F 
of Mella Roche for 40 years and Glaxo was with it for 35 years. <br>
The company has started looking for generic drugs to combat the challenge posed 
by imitators, it has also ventured into over the counter items like Tiger balm 
ointment, Salonpas plaster and Bigen. <br>
<br>
<font color="#CC3333">
<b>Lessons along the way</b></font><br>
“Always comply with the rules and regulations of one’s partners, and in the 
healthcare business there is no scope for any compromises. Second, look after
<br>
the interests of the customer and your sales force.”</font></p>

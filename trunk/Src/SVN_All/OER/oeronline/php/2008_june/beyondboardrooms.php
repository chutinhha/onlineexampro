<img border="0" src="beyond_boardrooms.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="134" height="130" hspace="5"><b>Name: </b><br>
G. Gopalakrishnan<br>
Designation: <br>
CEO, Jawad Sultan Technologies<br>
Interests:<br>
Golf, Tennis &amp; Travelling<br>
<b>Vision:</b><br>
To take Jawad Sultan Technologies to greater heights through a mixture of 
delivering next generation technology and services.<br>
<br>
G. Gopalakrishnan, hardly strikes you as the typical ex-army man. Yes there’s 
the upright carriage and sense of deportment accompanied by good old-fashioned 
chivalry. But the military man’s court of armour gets a few chinks that 
introduce you to a warm and sincere personality. As he recounts his extensive 
experience in the Indian army and workplace successes thereafter, you tend to 
see where that calm assertiveness and strength of character come from.<br>
<br>
“The Indian army gave me a lot of confidence in management vis-à-vis managing 
people, resources and updating myself to the latest technological changes in the 
world in IT and communications technology. It gave me a sense of commitment, 
dedication, and most importantly it taught me leadership qualities and excellent 
communication and interpersonal skills,” he says. These qualities saw 
Gopalakrishnan “shoulder large responsibilities – from personnel management to 
implementing various projects at all levels’. <br>
<br>
Gopalakrishnan took early retirement from the Indian army, bidding adieu to the 
army as a Colonel. On why he chose an early exit from a career that had been an 
integral part of his life and inspiration, Gopalakrishnan says, “I wanted to 
enter the corporate world and practise what I learned in the armed forces. ”<br>
<br>
Work and life post the army took Gopalakrishnan globetrotting all over Europe 
where he worked with various establishments and world-renowned organisations in 
the IT and telecommunications companies for over a decade. His fluency in German 
won him instant appeal in the German IT market and he worked for a number of 
prestigious assignments there.<br>
<br>
Gopalakrishnan later chose to settle in Oman more for personal reasons and 
landed the post of CEO with Jawad Sultan Technologies. However, the Sultanate 
roused his interest professionally as well. “I found there was a lot to 
contribute towards the country’s growth in my field of expertise which is IT, 
especially since Oman is scaling great heights in telecom and technology,” he 
says.<br>
<br>
He has brought in a lot of new synergies to the company since his joining from 
completely refurbishing the office interiors to bringing about better 
cooperation among staff. A walk through the office will find you constantly 
running into morale boosting quotes, again yet another of Gopalakrishnan’s team 
spirit and confidence building strategies.<br>
<br>
“My vision for the company is to take Jawad Sultan Technologies to greater 
heights through a mixture of delivering next generation technology and services. 
We propose to do this by understanding the needs of every agency. My sponsors 
fully support me in achieving my vision,” he says. <br>
<br>
As much as his day is preoccupied with the accomplishment of such noble ideals, 
Gopalakrishnan does find time to pursue his passion – Golf. Incidentally, he was 
the winner of last year’s OER CEO Golf in the 16-24 handicap. “I love tennis and 
travel. I’ve travelled to most countries in Europe and Asia Pacific for I like 
to meet people and develop good relationships,” says the retired Colonel. <br>
<br>
Oh, by the way, Gopalakrishnan may have given in the golden handshake at the 
army but he’s passed on his military-man’s legacy to his son and daughter who 
are currently in the ranks of Captain and Major in the Indian Army.<br>
<br>
What is his message to today’s youth? “Today’s world needs competent people with 
the ability to learn as they grow. Competence has to be added with a flavour of 
team spirit, sense of commitment, while at the same time one must accept 
responsibility and be proactive in any line of business one does.”</font></p>

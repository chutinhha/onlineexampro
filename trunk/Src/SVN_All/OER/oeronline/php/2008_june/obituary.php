		Karim Al Haremi, CEO of Oman Air passed away on April 9, 2007. The 
		untimely death of Haremi is a loss that corporate Oman will take a long 
		time to come to terms with. Haremi was an extraordinary CEO who was at 
		the helm of affairs at a crucial time. He achieved in a short span what 
		others would have taken a lifetime or more to achieve.<br>
		<br>
		As the CEO of Oman Air he steered the airline when it parted ways with 
		Gulf Air. It was his relentless focus on customer convenience that 
		ensured that traffic to and from Muscat went on without any significant 
		disruptions during this transition period. <br>
		<br>
		Realising the need to introduce long haul services and fleet upgradation 
		he went about getting state-of-the-art aircrafts against stiff 
		international competition from various airlines. He added frequencies to 
		the Indian subcontinent, South East Asia and Europe. If the Airline 
		seemed to be adding destinations by the week throughout 2007 a large 
		part of the credit goes to Haremi. In an effort to change the image of 
		the carrier he oversaw the brand revamp of the airline. <br>
		A man who combined intelligence, passion and charm Haremi’s death is a 
		loss which cannot be obliterated with the passage of time. <br>

		DOWN MEMORY LANE<br>
		A look at Ziad Karim Al Haremi’s thoughts and vision</b><br>
		“Oman’s growing global prominence in terms of economic growth and 
		immense potential in areas such as tourism has ensured scope for higher 
		passenger traffic and being the national carrier, it is with a firm 
		commitment that the airline pledges to connect the world with Oman.”<br>
		<br>
		<b>On the new B737-800NG joining the carrier </b><br>
		“There are immense investment opportunities in the Sultanate and the 
		continent’s many attractive tourist facilities will now be directly 
		accessible to people in Asia. We have selected Thailand as our base for 
		expansion into the region and want to take advantage of the 
		opportunities it can harness from the boom in passenger traffic through 
		the new Suvarnabhumi Airport.”<br>
		<br>
		<b>On Oman Air’s inaugural flight to the Far East</b><br>
		“Today marks a milestone in Oman Air’s proud history, and will move the 
		company closer to the realization of our ambitious growth plan. 
		Dreamliner will enable Oman Air to expand its route network, provide 
		excellent operating efficiencies, and cost savings. <br>
		<b><br>
		On Oman Air’s decision to add six Boeing 787s Dreamliner to its fleet</b><br>
		“Oman Air continued to break its former records and we are pleased with 
		such outstanding achievements. We are enthusiastic about increasing 
		passenger traffic, but at the same time, we are dedicated to providing 
		the highest degree of safety and reliability on a regular basis.” <br>
		<b><br>
		On Oman Air’s accomplishment in increasing passenger traffic</b><br>
		“The inauguration of this sector between Oman and Jordan will play an 
		active role in strengthening the historical relationship between the two 
		brotherly countries Oman and Jordan. It will also assist in supporting 
		the economic cooperation opportunities especially within the commerce 
		and tourism sectors.”<br>

<b>May proved to be good for GCC stock exchanges, with all markets ending on a 
positive note. The overall growth was due to the excellent Q1 figures from 
companies writes Harikumar Varma</b><br>
<br>
The MSM30 Index continued its upward momentum, gaining 3.78 per cent for the 
period from April 16 to May 15 . Heavyweights that contributed to the upward 
momentum were Omantel (+18.8 per cent), BankMuscat (+4.31 per cent) and Oman 
cable industry (+13.81 per cent).<br>
<br>
The Muscat market was the best performing one in the GCC during this period. 
Market volumes also burgeoned on the back of strong Q1 earnings and improved 
foreign participation. In April, non-Omani participation in the Muscat market 
increased to approximately 29 per cent of the total turnover. Average daily 
turnover increased by 12.1 per cent to RO19 million in the same period.<br>
<br>
In the sectoral indices, the services sector index was an outperformer mainly 
due to robust results from heavyweights like, Omantel, Shell Oman and 
Renaissance Services.<br>
<img border="0" src="gainers_losers.jpg" width="313" height="180" align="right" vspace="3"><br>
In corporate events, Topaz Energy and Marine Ltd., a subsidiary of Renaissance 
Services, acquired Qatar-based Doha Marine Service (DMS) for RO49 million. DMS 
owns 14 ships and is a debt-free company. DMS reported EBITDA of RO6.54 million 
in FY07. Also, the merger of National Finance and Muscat Finance did not receive 
the required approval from shareholders of Muscat Finance.<br>
<br>
In results, BankMuscat’s net profit grew by 39.4 per cent to RO26.5 million in 
Q1 FY08 compared to RO19 million in the year-ago quarter. BankMuscat also 
announced receipt of approval for setting up a branch in Kuwait. Omantel’s Q1 
net income soared by 60 per cent YoY to RO38.4 million in on the back of lower 
royalties, lower provisioning and better revenues.<br>
<br>
<b>GCC Market Commentary</b><br>
The month ended May 15 was a bright month for the GCC stock exchanges, with all 
markets ending in positive territory. The Doha Securities Market was the ace 
gainer for the second consecutive month on the back of excellent first quarter 
numbers declared by companies. As a result, the general index closed 8.32 per 
cent higher as compared to month-ago levels. Buying was seen in almost all the 
counters on the exchange, with the services index taking the lead and closing up 
12.38 per cent. . The DFM was the next best performer and grew by 3.88 per cent 
as compared to month-ago levels. Here, the insurance index was the top performer 
gaining 6.55 per cent followed by the investment and banking indices, which grew 
4.24 per cent and 4.22 per cent, respectively.<br>
<img border="0" src="gcc_market_index.jpg" width="359" height="167" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="8"><br>
The Abu Dhabi and the Saudi bourses too were in a bullish mode and their general 
index gained 3.37 per cent and 2.73 per cent respectively. The banking stocks 
dominated the Abu Dhabi exchange, with its banking index swelling by 5.95 per 
cent. The Kuwait stock exchange reported an increase of 1.20 per cent, with its 
major indices seeing a mixed trend. The Bahraini stock market ended almost flat: 
the general index gained just 0.52 per cent during the month. Here, the banking 
sector was among the ace performers and ended up 2.02 per cent, partially 
offsetting the drop seen in other major indices.<br>
<br>
<b>Research highlights</b><br>
BankMuscat enjoys a market share of 42.7 per cent in terms of total assets, 42.9 
per cent in terms of total credit and 39.6 per cent in terms of total customer 
deposits as at year-end 2007. Bank Muscat (BKM) delivered better first quarter 
result as compared to our expectations. Net interest income increased by 38 per 
cent growth YoY to RO38.8 million while other operating income grew by 102 per 
cent to RO18 million. <br>
<br>
BankMuscat’s Q1 earnings grew by 39.2 per cent growth on increased volumes from 
core banking activity (rising interest and non-interest income). While net 
interest income grew by 38 per cent, non-interest income showed a sharper growth 
at 102 per cent. Though higher provisions and lower recoveries dampened the 
bottomline growth, we are satisfied to see the significant influence of the core 
income stream in the bank’s net profit, which appears to be sustainable.<br>
<img border="0" src="msm_index.jpg" width="359" height="178" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="8">At net levels, BKM added RO292 million in Q1 to its loan book, a growth of 46.4 
per cent. Conducive macro-economic conditions and a fast expanding economy are 
believed to be the key growth drivers, and BKM being the market leader, is 
reflecting the systemic growth on its asset base. Sequentially, however, loan 
growth had peaked in the last quarter of fiscal 2007 (RO326 million).<br>
<br>
Strong liquidity and a robust economic environment continue to provide 
opportunities to the banking sector and we think BankMuscat has consistently 
benefited from it , as demonstrated by its aggressive growth rates. The bank has 
now set its eyes on regional expansion, and is launching operations in the GCC’s 
largest market, Saudi Arabia. The management feels that Saudi operations should 
add positive numbers to BKM’s consolidated net profits in 2008. An ambitious 
growth plan has also been drawn up for its associate, BankMuscat International, 
in Bahrain, targeting offshore opportunities in the emerging markets in the 
African continent.<br>
<br>
Given that the aggressive loan growth seen in 2007 and Q1 2008 could be repeated 
in the current fiscal, we have maintained our growth estimates for BKM at 25 per 
cent. Assuming a non-interest income growth of 35 per cent for the current year, 
we estimate an EPS of RO0.110 in 2008. Given its investment in India’s HDFC 
Bank, the book value is estimated to be RO0.781 by the end of 2008. The current 
market price discounts the EPS estimate by 19.2 times and the book value by 2.9 
times. With the scope of a higher leverage on its buttressed net worth, one can 
expect positive earnings surprises from BKM in 2008. We maintain our HOLD 
rating. <br>

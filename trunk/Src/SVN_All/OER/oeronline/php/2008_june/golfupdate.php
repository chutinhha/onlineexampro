<b>A look at what makes Tiger Woods a global Golf icon</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="golf_update.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="124" height="316">Eldrick T. “Tiger” Woods, born on December 30, 1975, had an early induction into 
Golf. He started playing when he was barely two years old. In 1978, he putted 
against comedian Bob Hope in a television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show. 
He rapidly shot to childhood celebrity status, shooting a 48 over nine holes at 
the Navy Golf Club in Cypress, California and at age five he appeared in Golf 
Digest and on ABC’s hit show That’s Incredible. In 1984 at the age of eight he 
won the 9–10 boys’ event, the youngest age group available, at the Junior World 
Golf Champoinships. Woods went on to win the Junior World Championships six 
times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991. His profressional 
prowess and continous wins soon made Woods the highest-paid professional athlete 
in 2007, with an estimated $112 million garnered from winnings and endorsements. 
Golf Digest, in fact, predicts Woods will become the world’s first billionaire 
athlete in 2010. <br>
<br>
Woods hails from a multicultural lineage – his father Earl is of mixed African 
American, Chinese and Native American decent and his mother Kultida is of mixed 
Thai, Chinese and Dutch heritage. So Woods often refers to his colourful ethnic 
origin as ‘Cablinasian’ (a portmanteau term he coined from Caucasian, Black, 
American-Indian and Asian. Interestingly enough he is a Buddhist, a faith he 
says he acquired from his mother and one which gives him control over his 
stubborness and impatience. The nickname ‘Tiger’ comes from his father’s Green 
Beret army past. Incidendally Earl had given the name to a South Vietnamese 
soldier friend, Vuong Dang Phong, who is believed to have saved his life on 
several occasions.<br>
<br>
To date, Woods has won 13 profesional and major golf champoinships, the second 
highest of any male player, and 64 PGA Tour events. At age 21, Woods became the 
youngest Masters champ and the first golfer since Jerry Pate in 1976 to win in 
the first major he played. He has the distinction of being the youngest player 
to ahieve the career Grand Slam and is rated as the youngest and fastest to win 
50 tournaments on tour. Woods has held the number one position in the world 
rankings for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of 
weeks.<br>
<img border="0" src="golfupdate2.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="199" height="228"><br>
He has been awared PGA Player of the Year a record nine times, the Byron Nelson 
Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times and he is also 
the only sportsman to be named Sports Illustrated’s Sportsman of Year more than 
once.<br>
<br>
Significantly, Woods made history in challenging social stereotypes by becoming 
the first African American as well as the first Asian American to win a major. 
His multi-racial good looks and trademark sense of humour made him the perfect 
candidate for endorsements for golfing equipment and apparel.<br>
<br>
Woods maybe the most charismatic figure in golf, but his approach, at its core, 
is cautious. He always aims for consistency. His dominance on the turf comes not 
from regularly posting low rounds, but instead from avoiding bad ones. Woods 
plays fewer tournaments than most professionals – just 15-21 per year compared 
to the usual 25-30. His efforts are focused more on preparing for and peaking at 
the Majors and other prestigious tournaments.<br>

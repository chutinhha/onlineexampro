<b>Oman has a lot going for it as a tourism destination – pristine natural beauty 
and authentic Arab culture. All it needs to do is ramp up infrastructure to be 
on par with the rest of the region<br>
</b>
<br>
Having adopted a low-key approach to tourism in the past, Oman is currently 
pushing the industry up its list of priorities. With its host of natural 
attractions, the country has identified the tourist profile it is seeking to 
draw and is now busy making the necessary investments to bring infrastructure up 
to standard.<br>
<br>
According to the World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), Oman’s tourism sector 
directly contributed an estimated $770m to the country’s gross domestic product 
(GDP) in 2007, and some $1.15bn if the indirect economic impact is also 
aggregated. The WTTC forecasts strong growth in the next decade, which could see 
these figures touch $1.5bn and $2.5bn respectively. Government figures show that 
some 1.3m tourists visited the Sultanate in 2006. However, Oman’s tourism 
strategy means that increasing tourism revenue need not necessarily entail a 
massive increase in the visitor numbers.<br>
<br>
This is primarily because Oman has firmly set its sights on attracting high-end 
visitors. Looking to its strengths of long, untouched coastlines, dramatic 
mountain scenery, wildlife, active local culture and varied architecture, it is 
being promoted as a cultural and natural tourism destination which appeals to a 
more affluent and often more mature demographic. This strategy is in line with 
the broader vision of development that the Sultanate’s leadership is pursuing, 
to gradually open the country up, whilst preserving the Omani culture and 
relatively conservative way of life. A significant emphasis has been on the 
preservation of the natural environment, which is, of course, key to developing 
this type of tourism. Moreover, top-end affluent travellers are not only likely 
to spend more and stay longer, thus creating the all-important revenue, they are 
also more likely to be mindful of cultural and environmental issues.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="economy.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="200" height="124" hspace="5">Clearly Oman would not be able to focus on this niche were it not for its 
relative bounty of attractions from the natural landscape to forts and the 
seasonal Khareef festival, which is a living tradition rather than a theme-park 
recreation of an Arabian festival. However, what is currently lacking is the 
right sort of tourism infrastructure. There are two reasons for this. <br>
<br>
Until His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said came to the throne, the Sultanate was 
largely closed to foreigners. In the first years of his reign the priority was 
understandably on building the basics for Omanis, something that was done 
remarkably quickly by any standards but also meant that necessarily the focus 
was inward. As a result there were relatively few hotels and connections to 
tourist markets in the rest of the world. The second factor is economic: The 
nature of Oman’s oil industry has meant that it has not experienced quite the 
glut of investment and commercial activity of other states in the region. Due to 
the higher costs of extraction and refining, Oman reaps oil income windfalls and 
large inflows of investment only when there is a rise in prices, as there is 
now. Therefore there has not been as much international business interest in 
Oman as elsewhere in the region until recently.<br>
<br>
So Oman is not in the position to follow the model of Abu Dhabi in using an 
already developed, relatively extensive business tourism infrastructure and 
market as a base. Abu Dhabi’s concept of encouraging holiday extensions to 
business visits as a way of developing leisure tourism would not be viable in 
Oman.<br>
<br>
This is a double edged-sword. On the one hand, Muscat has arguably the 
best-preserved traditional cityscape of any Gulf capital. On the other, hotels 
around the city are reporting 90 per cent-plus occupancy rates, and room rates 
are galloping ahead of improvements in facilities. While almost all Gulf cities 
are experiencing a hotel room squeeze, Muscat’s problem is particularly acute. 
And, while business travellers on expense accounts may not be too bothered, Oman 
can ill afford to see the discerning holidaymakers it aims to attract (and 
promote the country in their homelands) being put off by paying rates that are 
deemed expensive.<br>
<br>
The government and the private sector are working hard to remedy this, however, 
with some $5.5bn of tourism-related investment underway. A raft of hotels are 
being built or planned around Muscat, where the current demand is highest 
(though some of the resort projects, sold off-plan, have yet to materialise, 
raising fears of a bubble). Some 16 of these are planned in Blue City, a $15bn 
development with 16km of coastline 30 minutes from Muscat’s international 
airport at Seeb. Another will be a spa hotel – again fitting the tourism 
strategy’s brief – as part of the Yiti development south of the city.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Oman is looking to the opportunities for tourism offered by more 
remote areas of the country, for example the Musandam Peninsula and Jebel Akhdar. 
It is also increasingly promoting the region of Dhofar in the far south, where 
the annual Khareef festival takes place.<br>
<br>
Ever since the Gulf countries began promoting themselves as tourism 
destinations, there has been an unspoken flipside to their proud boasts of 
“year-round sun”: The sweltering, humid summers in the region, which for a few 
months put off those tourists wanting to do more with their holiday than shop in 
air-conditional malls. Again, Oman has fortune in nature. Dhofar is in the only 
corner of the Arabian Peninsula which experiences the Asian summer monsoon, and 
therefore has not only lush, green countryside a world away from the desert of 
the interior, but also has the Khareef Festival to celebrate it. <br>
<br>
In 2007, the festival which incorporates folk traditions including dance, music, 
visual arts and poetry, ran from mid-July to the end of August. A total of more 
than 350,000 tourists attended the festival, an increase of 23.5 per cent on 
2006. Around 184,000 were foreign visitors, many of them from other GCC member 
states, particularly the UAE.<br>
<br>
The Khareef is typical of Oman’s drive to preserve and promote its traditions. 
It is also indicative of the aspect of its tourism industry that has been 
overlooked by the media as interest grows from Europe and the Far East – the s 
mall but very affluent tourism market almost on Oman’s doorstep. <br>
<br>
The opportunity to attract Gulf nationals looking for a place where Arab culture 
has been preserved without aspic, but which remains exceptionally safe and 
comfortable, is another niche that the authorities are developing. Such is the 
growing appeal of the festival that seasonal flights are laid on by carriers 
such as Saudi Arabian Airlines. <br>
<br>
Oman’s chosen tourism strategy complements rather than competes with many of the 
other GCC member states and emirates. It has not set its sights on Muscat 
becoming another bright-lights metropolis like Dubai; this will not be viable. 
Nor will it emulate Sharjah’s recent success as an affordable sun-sea-sand 
destination; it would not be in keeping with the leadership’s vision. Nor is it 
looking to sport like Bahrain with Formula One (F1) racing and Qatar with its 
golf and tennis.<br>
<br>
There could be a rivalry with Abu Dhabi, which is also targeting well-heeled 
visitors with an interest in culture, and which is starting to brand itself as 
offering a ‘unique’ Arabian experience. Additionally, Abu Dhabi will offer 
attractions that Oman will not (the Louvre and Guggenheim Museums and an F1 
track). However, Oman does have myriad forts, traditional architecture and more 
varied topography and ecology.<br>
But as industry officials in several Gulf countries argue (contradicting claims 
that they must all compete with Dubai), if tourists visit one country in the 
region and have a positive experience, they are likely to consider another 
visit, perhaps to a different country. Therefore the development of the regional 
tourism sector can benefit rather than impinge on that of Oman.<br>
<br>
Oman has the great advantage of its natural, cultural and architectural 
resources but an almost blank slate in terms of tourism infrastructure. Now, it 
has both the resources and a strategy to develop the sector and the results are 
beginning to show. Oman is one to watch. <br>

<b>Online trading provides a secure and convenient platform for investors to 
trade directly on the stock market. Mayank Singh reports<br>
<br>
</b><br>
Abdul Hamid Ahmed an avid investor has stopped making frequent trips to his 
brokerage company to handover cheques, purchase shares or to discuss price 
movements. Here’s why: Ahmed has shifted from trading through a broker to 
trading online. “This gives me the flexibility to trade without going through a 
broker,” he says. <br>
<br>
<b>Multiple choices </b><br>
With a number of brokerage companies and institutions vying to introduce online 
trading services investors now have a variety of choices. There are three online 
trading platforms on offer in the market - Al-Amin Securities, United Securities 
and Oman Arab Bank (OAB). Al-Amin offers two services – Al-Amin Trade and 
Mubasher Pro. The first one is a basic trading platform that allows investors to 
trade, while Mubasher Pro is a more advanced version. United Securities e-Tadawul 
and OAB’s e-link are the other two services on offer. Says Lo’ai Badie Bataineh 
DGM – investment and development and head of Investment Management Group, OAB, 
“To trade online an investor just needs to have an online trading account, 
sufficient cash to trade and a know how to use a computer.”<img border="0" src="online_trading.jpg" width="144" height="229" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="8"><br>
<br>
The first step in the process is to open an Internet trading account with any of 
these companies. On doing so he gets an investor number (folio number) which 
enables him to trade on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM). In addition he gets 
a user ID and a password which enable him to access his account. An account 
holder can see his portfolio, watch the market price of various shares and place 
online orders. “The investor needs to come to us for the first time to get an 
MSM depository number which is essential to activate an account. In all it takes 
about 15 minutes for an account to become operational,” says Hussain Ali Al 
Raisi, Executive President, Al-Amin Securities.<br>
<br>
While e-Tadawul and e-link give investors the facility to trade on the MSM, Al-Amin’s 
Mubasher Pro extends this facility to trade across the region’s bourses like 
Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Kuwait and Dubai. A subscriber can trade on 
these markets using different passwords for each market. Mubasher Pro also gives 
clients a detailed analysis of the market in the form of financial data, graphs 
and charts. All this, however, comes at a price – Mubasher Pro comes at an 
annual subscription of RO200 or a monthly rental of RO20. The software can be 
installed on a mobile phone as Mubasher Mobile enabling a subscriber to get 
market related information on his mobile or a Blackberry. So anyone travelling 
and not having access to a personal computer can see the information on his 
mobile phone. “The service is getting popular and we have 90 to 100 Mubasher Pro 
users,” says Raisi.<br>
<br>
<b>Technology at work </b><br>
With security being a major concern all the organisations have invested in 
securing the system. Says Bataineh, “OAB has spent over over $1mn to ensure the 
security of e-link.” Both Mubasher and e-Tadawul use a 128-bit encrypted SSL 
(secured socket layer) security system. “SSL creates a tunnel between the user 
and us and if anyone tries to hack into the system this tunnel is closed 
automatically,” says Osama Bassam, IT consultant, United Securities. SSL is one 
of the most popular security module used internationally. <br>
<img border="0" src="online_trading_raisi.jpg" width="148" height="240" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="8"><br>
To enhance confidentiality, United Securities posts an account holder’s password 
and login to one’s e-mail ID instead of handing it over manually. Al-Amin has 
introduced a transaction password in addition to the mandatory login and trading 
password. The user needs to use the transaction ID for making an online 
transaction ensuring additional security. <br>
<br>
Overall, there are two important components that the system needs to connect – 
the first being price and the second is trade. The price of a share is generated 
on the MSM and so every organisation needs to connect its trading platform to 
the MSM server. This is done through leased lines. The price generated on the 
stock market is transmitted through these leased lines and is displayed on the 
customer’s console in real time. <br>
<br>
To facilitate trading, the MSM has a special engine and dedicated server for 
each company. Orders are booked online and are sent directly to the MSM for 
execution. These then get executed instantaneously. Investors can trade online 
during market hours from 9.30 am to 1 am. OAB and United Securities take orders 
during trading hours, Al Amin accepts orders even after the market closes, 
though these are executed only on the next trading day. <br>
<br>
OAB has installed a special computer screen in its office for customers to come 
and check share prices.<br>
<br>
The system can be accessed using either a dial-up facility or through a 
broadband connection. There are times when the dial-up speed of 30 kilo bits per 
second may prove to be a trifle slow for live updates. ADSL speeds of 256 kilo 
bits per second would be the ideal vehicle for the service. However, the pricing 
of an ADSL connection (the lowest package being RO12 per month) has been a 
deterrent to increasing its usage. Says Osama, “If we get some more services 
from MSM (like being connected to other markets) and lower priced lines from 
Omantel then online trading can grow rapidly in Oman.”<br>
<br>
Companies on their part are trying to make the best of the bargain. United 
Securities for example has leased out space at the Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM) 
to host two of its three servers (one is kept in its office) to enhance the 
speed of its download. This provides e-Tadawul a higher bandwidth as KOM has a 
2MB upload capacity compared to one MB in other places. Thus a download facility 
from a server hosted at KOM takes one-sixteenth of the time compared to a server 
hosted elsewhere. <br>
<br>
Despite glitches such as slow dial-up speeds, online trading is slowly but 
surely gaining prominence in the Sultanate. Al-Amin, for instance, has 4,000 
subscribers out of which almost half are active users. United Securities has 
notched up 215 clients. <br>
<br>
International experience shows that online trading on an average increases trade 
transactions on a stock market by at least 30 per cent. This is not surprising 
as the service offers a number of advantages. “Online trading encourages retail 
investors to participate on the stock market as small investors find it 
difficult to get enough attention from brokers,” says Bataineh. </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
The brokerage fee for online trading is also comparatively lower. Thus brokerage 
companies which charge a 0.75 per cent fee on the value of a transaction are 
charging 0.4 per cent for a similar transaction carried out online. Online 
trading also strikes a chord with youngsters who are more technology savvy. <br>
<b><br>
Cutting edge</b><br>
Most companies have adopted state-of-the art facilities for the service.<img border="0" src="online_trading_osama.jpg" width="110" height="187" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="8"> For 
example – United Securities is using FIT (first information technology), a 
regional leader in online trading technology. FITS uses four servers namely 
E-access which allows the integration of the web based user with the brokers 
database, Fits Trade which facilitates the connection between United Securities 
and the MSM, FTP pro which sends out messages to the client and interconnects 
the web data base with the company’s database. And finally, there is a database 
server. FIT scores over its rival as it combines an order management system with 
online trading. <br>
<br>
Though the technologies used by different companies may vary almost all of them 
use an FIX protocol network and a TCPIP system to communicate. The protocol is 
recommended by the MSM. Interestingly, while United Securities and OAB use a 
Windows based platform, Al-Amin uses both a Linux and Windows based system. <br>
Given its benefits, online trading is sure to lure more customers like Ahmed 
away from brokers and onto their computer screens. </font></p>

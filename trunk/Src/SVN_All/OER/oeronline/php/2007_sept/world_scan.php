into $50-billion Indian retail market</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
It is the turn of many Indian retailers to lose their bread-and-butter as 
Walmart enters Indian market. While the Indian government’s decision to 
partially open the retail sector to foreign players has been criticised by small 
traders, Walmart has tied up with India’s Bharti Enterprises to set up a retail 
base in the country. <br>
<br>
As part of the agreement, the US-based retailer would handle back-end operations 
of the joint venture company. With Bharti as its partner, Walmart has some 
ambitious plans to take over India’s retail market, which is worth a whopping 
US$50 billion. To make the most of the wholesale opportunity, Walmart will 
invest several millions of dollars into setting up supply chain infrastructure 
in India. The company is in talks with local logistics’ providers and suppliers 
in India to source for its B-to-B wholesale cash and carry joint venture with 
Bharti.<br>
<br>
“We are looking at local warehouses, trucking companies and refrigeration 
manufacturers. We will certainly have our own warehouses and distribution 
centers across India,” said Raj Jain, Country President, Walmart India.<br>
<br>
The Bharti-Walmart alliance is also talking to global suppliers in China, US and 
Latin America to join them in India. Walmart is currently sourcing products 
worth US$600 million from India and the figures are expected to multiply once 
the cash-and-carry stores start rolling out by the end of 2008.<br>

<img border="0" src="world.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="4"></b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">Monster.com waited five days to tell its users about a security breach that 
resulted in the theft of confidential information from some 1.3 million job 
seekers. The hackers broke into the US online recruitment site’s 
password-protected resume library in one of the biggest Internet security 
breaches in recent memory.<br>
<br>
According to Monster, the information stolen was limited to names, addresses, 
phone numbers and e-mail addresses, and no other details, including bank account 
numbers, were uploaded. Pretending to be sent through Monster.com from job 
recruiters, the e-mails asked recipients to provide personal financial data, 
including bank account numbers. They also asked users to click on links that 
could infect their PCs with malicious software. Monster’s database has about 73 
million resumes.<br>

diseases like AIDS on their way</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned the world to expect a new killer 
disease to emerge in the next few years which will threaten the lives of 
millions.<br>
<br>
The WHO says the new disease will have the impact of HIV/AIDS or Ebola and 
potentially deadly new diseases are being identified at an “unprecedented rate” 
with at least one new disease identified every year since the 1970s.<br>
<br>
There are now 39 more diseases that were unknown just over a generation ago and 
the WHO says global epidemics are spreading more rapidly than ever. The UN 
agency says infectious diseases are spreading faster due to global travel and a 
worldwide market in live animals. There are now more than 2 billion global air 
travellers each year, says the WHO and this means an outbreak or epidemic in one 
part of the world is only a few hours away from becoming an imminent threat 
somewhere else. The agency maintains the next influenza pandemic is likely to be 
a bird flu one which could affect around 1.5 billion people and the question is 
one of when rather than whether.<br>

The first and the most celebrated iPhone hacker is an American teenager George 
Hotz. With a little soldering, a lot of command-line computing and about two 
hours of time, Hotz was able to switch an iPhone over to T-Mobile, which he 
documented in detail in a YouTube video and on his blog. The iPhone runs on GSM 
networks, which only T-Mobile and AT&amp;T Wireless run in the US Hotz collaborated 
online with four other people, two of them in Russia, to develop the unlocking 
process.<br>
<br>
Apple may be able to counter the hacks, either with a software patch 
downloadable through iTunes or with physical changes on the iPhone production 
line. Although even hacked iPhones have to be bought from Apple, the company is 
reportedly getting a cut of the monthly subscription fees from AT&amp;T. <br>
<br>
The real market for unlocked iPhones is in Europe, where the iPhone is not 
scheduled to be on sale until sometime this fall, and in the rest of the world, 
which with the exception of South Africa won’t see it until next year. <br>

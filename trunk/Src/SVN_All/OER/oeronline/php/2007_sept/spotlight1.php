<img border="0" src="spot3.jpg" align="right">Products: Digital multifunction document management devices, Laser printers, 
heavy duty document scanners, fax, digital duplicators, document management and 
printing solutions<br>
<br>
Ricoh believes that document management should increase user efficiency and 
simplify his work. Therefore, user oriented development is the key and Ricoh 
spends 10% our its net sales as R&amp;D investments and has always been at the 
forefront of innovation. Ricoh products allow for most extensive customization 
and integration possibilities due to their unique open architecture.<br>
<br>
<b>Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) approach</b>: Multifunctional products that are 
converging functions such as copy/fax/scan/print/store/retrieve are the norm 
instead of standalone units. Users are saving printing costs as well as on 
space, electricity with increased productivity and efficiency. <br>
<br>
These devices are also capable of scanning over networks and hence ideally 
suited for addressing the document management requirements of the customer. The 
TCO is significantly lower with solutions available with Ricoh. Only the 
sustainability-driven companies will survive the eminent shakeout. RICOH Co as a 
manufacturer is listed in top global rankings. Document and workflow management 
demands have brought heavy-duty network scanners into sharp focus – another 
strength area for RICOH. As multifunction devices get connected in large numbers 
across company networks security of information is a major concern. Herein lies 
the security paradox – on one hand there is the inherent advantage of faster 
info sharing and distribution and on the other is the possibility of leakage due 
to the sharing &amp; distribution process. RICOH products offer unique solutions – 
such as printing ‘patterns’ on the pages that when copied result in a blank 
sheet output from the machine. <br>
<br>
<b>Green machines</b>: Carbon dioxide emissions, restriction of hazardous chemicals, 
and energy conservation are also turning into serious trend dictating which 
office equipment manufacturer can exist in future. These are environmental 
issues and Kyoto Protocol is exerting tremendous pressure on manufacturers. Over 
the years Ricoh has led the industry with major innovations in the environment 
related areas. <br>
<br>
Ricoh devices are free from any chemicals as per EU directives on restriction of 
hazardous substances. Most other manufacturers are yet to comply and will not be 
allowed to sell their devices in Europe which can affect their very existence. 
Energy conservation is achieved by the QSU and Standby modes to ensure lowest 
power consumption (just 10watts in standby mode – a significant figure as 
photocopiers are in standby mode for 80% of their life!) Carbon dioxide 
emissions are within new and stricter norms due to special toners used.<br>

<b>Oman Market</b><br>
Factors such as oil prices, foreign investments, tourism focus, increased 
government spending etc are fuelling growth and the market for office copiers is 
expected to grow about 15 % this year at the minimum. Customer needs are growing 
increasingly sophisticated and diverse. Customer-driven organizations with the 
right tie-ups and knowledge and skills base will benefit from this opportunity 
by offering comprehensive solutions (as against box selling approach). Muscat 
Electronics is geared to provide solutions to meet diverse needs of our 
customers. The success of the solutions approach is already reflected in 
increased market share for color and b/w multifunction digital laser copier 
products at a healthy (estimated) 23% market share for RICOH. The ‘full power of 
Ricoh’ due to its enhanced product offering will be even more visible this year. 
Ricoh color laser printers are also gathering market shares rapidly at the 
high-end. Ricoh has an extensive lineup of products designed to efficiently 
create and share documents. The products can help users streamline their 
document workflows and cut costs.<br>
<br>
<b>New Printing technology</b>: The Gelsprinter™ uses the Ricoh patented gel printing 
technology. The printers use fast drying Liquid Gel™, wide print head, advanced 
paper handling technology, to provide vibrant color prints on regular paper at a 
very low cost per printed page at fast speeds even when printing duplex. The 
high speed and color prints that are virtually at the same cost as black &amp; 
white, make these innovative devices an ideal office printer.<br>
<br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="spot5.jpg" width="200" height="191" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="4">RICOH MP C 1500SP</b>: With this product introduction, even the entry level copiers 
will be able to provide color copy and prints and color prints will virtually be 
at the same low cost as black and white. <br>
<br>
<b>RICOH MP C 2500/3500/4500</b>: Machines that offer the economy of black &amp; white and 
the power of high speed colour. Available with various finishing options(such as 
booklet finisher) , these devices are supplied with free software to manage all 
office documents(fax/copy/scan and print data).Document distribution is also 
very efficient due to scan to email and scan to folder features. LAN fax and 
internet fax are cost saving functions on these versatile devices. As they sit 
on the network, IT administrators are supplied with software tools to monitor 
them with web browsers. Security features prevent unauthorized access. Finally 
the cost per copy/print is low resulting in a low Total cost of ownership (TCO).<br>
<br>
<b>RICOH AF MP5500/6500/7500 and AF MP9000/1100/1350</b>: These devices are the heavy 
duty black and white machines with 1200 x 1200 dpi copy/print capability at high 
speeds upto 135 cpm and are the only machines in the industry designed for 
document production in the print shop kind of environment. The machines can 
operate virtually nonstop as toners and paper can be inserted without 
interrupting the machine. The machines are capable of handling tremendous 
volumes (1 million per month). Many reputed organizations have switched to these 
revolutionary machines.<br>

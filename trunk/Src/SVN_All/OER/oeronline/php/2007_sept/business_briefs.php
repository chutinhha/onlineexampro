Oman’s Ministry of Tourism, and will consist of four 5-star hotels with 
approximately 900 rooms, an 18-hole international golf course; a wide range of 
facilities, including sports and leisure infrastructure, a resort village, 
nature reserve and visitors’ centre, beach club, heritage and craft centre; and 
major open spaces; 1,400 residential villas and up to 1,900 residential 
apartments and townhouses. The site is being planned as a high-end 
environmentally sensitive project, specifically designed to reflect the natural

Sayyidah Rawan Al Said, NBO’s Deputy Chairperson said: “The loan was syndicated

turbulence currently being seen in the US sub-prime market, we achieved a 
healthy oversubscription and the Facility was scaled-back. The success of the

National Economy Ministry in cooperation with Ministry of Tourism and Royal Oman 
Police. The count of tourists between June 21, when the Khareef season began, 
and August 17 was an all-time high of 306,007, compared with 241,861 in the 
corresponding period of 2006. While the government is making all out efforts to 
woo more tourists to Salalah, known as the land of frankincense, private sector 
companies have set up shop in a major way at the Khareef Festival grounds which 
has become the beehive of all activities. Major corporate entities like Oman 
Air, Omantel, Nawras, BankDhofar, HSBC Bank, BankMuscat and other companies 
dealing with consumer goods have all upped their ante to cash in on the huge

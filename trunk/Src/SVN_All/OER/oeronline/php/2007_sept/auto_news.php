Mercedes-Benz has revealed the first details of its new super sedan, the C 63 
AMG, which features the V8 powerplant that enables the car to sprint from 0 to 
100 km/h in just 4.5 seconds. Underneath the hood, is a 6.3-litre engine that 
develops 457 hp and a maximum torque of 600 Nm, which provides maximum 
acceleration at any engine speed range. The high-performance eight-cylinder 
engine is partnered by the AMG Speedshift Plus 7G-Tronic transmission. Equipped 
with AMG gearshift paddles on the steering wheel and three driving modes, the 
seven-speed automatic transmission allows the driver to choose between the “S” 
(Sport), “C” (Comfort) or “M” (Manual) driving modes. Gear shifting in the 
manual mode is around 50 per cent faster than in the comfort setting.<br>

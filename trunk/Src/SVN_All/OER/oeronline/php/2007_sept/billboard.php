        In August, the Sohar branch of Bank Sohar started operations at Souq 
        Sohar. The monthly draw of the bank’s ‘Al Mumayaz’ saving scheme with 
        Lexus 350 as a prize was conducted on the occasion. “The sheer scale of 
        the economic development now under progress in Sohar makes it an ideal 
        time for Bank Sohar to make its debut in the city,” said Nani B. Javeri, 
        Chief Executive Officer of the bank. “The bank ventures into Sohar at a 
        time when the economic environment and the infrastructure for conducting 
        business both local and international are at its prime. The Sohar branch 
        will be staffed by Omani nationals with years of experience in banking 
        and with an avowed commitment to customer service,” added Jhaveri.<br>

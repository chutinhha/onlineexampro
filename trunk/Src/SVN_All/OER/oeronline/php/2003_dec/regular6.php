            us about your career…</b><br>
            Born and bred in the UK, I studied at Loughborough University in 
            1958 and graduated a few years later with a Bachelor of Arts degree 
            in Business Administration. Following my graduation, I joined the 
            Royal Air Force (RAF) on a five-year short service commission. While 
            serving with the RAF, I successfully achieved a HND in hotel 
            management. On leaving the RAF, I joined Mount Charlotte Investments 
            as a General Manager looking after their hotels developing my career 
            in the hospitality industry in the UK. In 1970, I decided that I 
            needed to broaden my horizons and travelled to the Middle East. 
            During the past 33 years I have spent working in the region, I have 
            been involved in catering and support services in most of the 
            countries in the Gulf. This career path gave me the opportunity to 
            join the international company Universal Sodexho. My employment with 
            them enabled me to move to Oman as General Manager of SOCAT LLC 
            where I have enjoyed working for the past three years. <br>
            <br>
            <b>What improvements to the economy have you noticed during your 
            time in Oman?</b><br>
            During my time in the Sultanate, the change that has impressed me 
            the most has been the way in which Omanis have been able to adapt 
            themselves to dramatic changes within the private sector. 
            Specifically, I have observed a transformation as increasingly more 
            nationals find job satisfaction within the contract services 
            industry. Typically, the universal perception of catering and 
            support services has not been as appealing as other occupations. I 
            feel that the dedication and self-motivation that I have witnessed 
            at first hand among my own staff in this profession has been 
            exemplary. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Which one skill is the most important to your catering staff?</b><br>
            Knowledge.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What challenges has SOCAT had to overcome in 2003?</b><br>
            All private companies within our industry are very aware of how 
            fiercely competitive the market has become over the past few years. 
            In addition, online bidding has had a particularly detrimental 
            effect on the whole industry by drastically squeezing margins. 
            Fortunately, the compensating factor for SOCAT LLC is our logistics 
            and purchasing management system which allows our company to 
            purchase at competitive rates through volume buying.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What hurdles lie ahead for the catering services industry?</b><br>
            The ever-increasing costs of commodities which includes the recent 
            increase in unified customs tariff across goods imported into the 
            GCC has substantially eaten into the profitability of companies 
            within our industry sector. Companies cannot afford to lose trade by 
            passing this additional expense on to their customers. Looking 
            ahead, this is the toughest challenge our industry faces.<br>
            Omanisation is another issue our industry is addressing. SOCAT LLC 
            is a member of OPAL, the industry forum whose membership is made up 
            of companies from all sectors of the petroleum industry in Oman. 
            Hopefully, we will realise the benefits of such membership and the 
            initiatives of OPAL will improve business practices throughout the 
            country, develop the competency of the Omani people and help to 
            resolve some of the challenges of Omanisation in our industry.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What role does Information Technology (IT) play in a catering 
            services company?</b><br>
            How did we ever manage to achieve business success in the past 
            without IT? SOCAT LLC harnesses IT in much the same way that any 
            other successful business do. Our IT management system has become an 
            essential tool which allows us to analyse data to aid our decision 
            making and financial planning; it is pivotal when it comes to 
            organising the logistical side of our operations; and it is at the 
            heart of making our communication<br>
            more efficient—a fact highlighted by the recently launch of our 
            Internet portal which explains to prospective clients that are 
            online what our company has to offer. <br>
            <br>
            <b>SOCAT LLC was recently awarded with the Global HACCP. What does 
            this achievement mean?</b><br>
            Our HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) System has been 
            developed along with our ISO 9001:2000 management system to give our 
            clients confidence in our services. HACCP ensures that the food 
            consumed by customers of SOCAT LLC is stored, prepared and served 
            hygienically to avoid contamination with pathogens (germs). Our 
            system ensures that at the designated critical control points, 
            checks are made to enable us to maintain the highest standard of 
            hygiene throughout the food preparation process<br>
            up to the serving point. The system prepared and used by our company 
            caters for the checking of goods supplied by local suppliers to 
            ensure that they are up to the standard required by SOCAT LLC as per 
            the ISO 9001:2000 procedural requirements too.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Do you enjoy cooking when you get the time? Who cooks most of 
            your meals?</b><br>
            Being as catering is my chosen profession, it should come as little 
            surprise that I have a passion for good food and, when time permits, 
            I enjoy cooking as well as all the delights of presenting a meal for 
            guests when the occasion arises. Other than that, my maid for 12 
            years (Jasmine) cooks a wide variety of various ethnic dishes.<br>
            <br>
            <b>What is your favourite dish?</b><br>
            You can’t beat a rack of lamb with mint jelly!<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tell us about your hobbies<br>
            </b>My hobbies include scuba diving in Oman, flying in the US and 
            sailing in the UK. One of my favourite diving sites in the Sultanate 
            is Mirbat. I also own a Cessna 172 light aircraft and have boats 
            moored in the UK close to my favourite sailing area: The English 
            Channel.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Where in Oman is the best place to get away and relax?</b><br>
            The beaches in Oman can sometimes be good hideaways from the 
            everyday hustle and bustle. I particularly enjoy Tiwi. Time 
            permitting; a trip to Salalah during the Khareef<br>
            Season is also a good place to get away and relax.</font></p>

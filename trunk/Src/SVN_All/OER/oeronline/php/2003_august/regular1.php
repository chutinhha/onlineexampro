            <img border="0" src="tunnel-Jan26.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="150">About 10 km from the Al Bustan Palace Hotel, overlooking the hills of Qantab, construction workers are weathering the sun and the rain to complete the Zubair Group of Companies' Barr Al Jissah Resort project on the coast southwest of Muscat in the Gulf of Oman.As part of the project, the Sultanate's first public access road tunnel is now ready. The credit for the tunnel,
            "a remarkable engineering feat," as T.V. Naganathan, the general manager of Larsen &amp; Toubro (Oman) LLC (L&amp;TO) puts it, goes to L&amp;TO, a joint venture between Larsen &amp; Toubro Limited, India (L&amp;T), and the Zubair Group-owned Muscat Trading Co.
            LLC.&nbsp;<br>
            "This 130-metre-long tunnel with a diameter of 6.16 metre has been completed within the boundaries of the Barr Al Jissah Resort," says Naganathan. Oman is engulfed mostly with hills, and the site of the Barr Al Jissah Resort project encompasses many hills surrounded by the sea.&nbsp;<br>
 The resort, to be managed by Shangri La,  consists of three hotels, and to maintain the scenic beauty of the site, it was decided to connect the two hotels by a tunnel, which would also add value to the unique recreational idea of the
            resort.<br>
            The tunnel is designed to carry utility service pipelines in the concrete service corridor, and will deliver hot and cold water and gas to the connecting hotels besides, obviously, being a one-way driveway for the resort's guests.<br>
            "The contract for the horse-shoe shaped tunnel with stainless steel bolting and shortcrete concreting within the Barr Al Jissah resort project was awarded to L&amp;TO in September 2002 based on the strength and expertise of its holding company, L&amp;T," says A. Ramakrishna, member of the board and director in-charge of L&amp;TO and president (operations) and deputy managing director of L&amp;T, who was in town for the signing of a RO3.5 million agreement with Muscat Municipality for the Al Khoud flyover and intersection which was awarded to L&amp;T.<br>
            The RO350,000 tunnel project was completed in a record time of five months, about 11 days ahead of schedule on April 1, 2003.
            "The tunnel project necessitated 4,000 manhours of work by 25 labourers working in three shifts," said Roger J. Nickells, senior resident engineer, WS Atkins International &amp; Co., under whose strict supervision the project was
            executed.<br>
            Carrion Alawi, the main contractor of the Barr Al Jissah Resort project, were
            "appointed after the successful completion of infrastructure works and the 2-km access road through the mountainous surroundings," said Simon Buttery, project director, Carillion Alawi (formerly Tarmac Alawi LLC).&nbsp;<br>
 Explaining in detail the making of the tunnel, a senior engineer with L&amp;TO said,
            "The tunnel consists of a portal (entrance) structure of 20 m on both ends, and has a finished profile of 6.65x6.16 m." The rock surrounding the area is limestone which, according to L&amp;TO officials, is a difficult rock to build tunnels in owing to its permeable and brittle nature.&nbsp;<br>
 The advancement of the tunnel was done from both the ends, and the tedious steps involved in the making of the tunnel were development and stabilisation of the portal, marking of profile and tunnel excavation with ground supports, rockbolting and shortcreting, and monitoring through sophisticated measuring instruments.<br>
            Carillion Alawi, which commenced work on the Package I development work of the Barr Al Jissah project in June 2002, is scheduled to complete this phase of the project by the end of this month. The scope of the work in this phase comprised construction/provision of enabling facilities to the multi-million-riyal hotel resort.&nbsp;<br>
 The site of the project was earlier accessible only through the sea before the road works were put in place, and now comprises sea mobilisation work, engineering and locker-building which is intended to become a permanent facility in the future, bulk earth works and road works, drainage and site service distribution, water and waste water system, utility buildings and provision of temporary works and services for future package contractors. The cost of this phase of the Barr Al Jissah Resort project is estimated to be RO4.2
            million.<br>
            <img border="0" src="tunnel-Jan261.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="150">Some of Carillion Alawi's previous high-profile projects include the RO147.1 million Royal Hospital, the RO35 million Mina Salalah Container Terminal, RO11 million expansion works of Oman Cement and the RO9.5 million Port Qaboos Development.<br>
            In fact, it was the same contractor that finished the Phase I of the Qantab-Barr Al Jissah Road project, valued at RO3.379 million. The scope of the work included the construction of a road approximately 4 km from the existing Muscat Qantab Road to the coast at Barr Al Jissah where the proposed resort was to come up and which was earlier accessible only through the sea.<br>
            The road runs through the rocky mountain terrain in Qantab and crosses several wadis where multicell concrete culverts and HDPE pipe culverts are constructed. Some sections of the road are supported on earth retaining structures made of concrete. This is road that is being used as the construction access of the resort project.</font></p>

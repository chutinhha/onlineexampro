            Coke's answer to Pepsi's popular Mountain Dew</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">
              <img border="0" src="QU-Jabal.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175" height="172">First, 
              the facts. Mountain Dew, Pepsi's citrus soft drink, enjoys immense 
              popularity among consumers in the Middle East and is believed to 
              hold more than one-third of the total carbonated beverages market 
              in the region. To counter this success enjoyed by Mountain Dew, 
              archrival Coca-Cola has launched Quwat Jabal, its very own citrus 
              aerated soft drink. <br>
              That, as would be palpable to even a marketing moron, is the 
              bedrock of the stage for another major brand war. Only, this time 
              round, it's happening first in Oman. &quot;Oman has the biggest citrus 
              segment in the entire region and that is why it was normal to 
              launch our new citrus product in it first, which only highlights 
              the importance of the Sultanate within our overall Middle East 
              strategy,&quot; asserts Adham Hussein, Regional Marketing Manager, 
              Coca-Cola Middle East.<br>
              &quot;The Coca-Cola Company develops local brands according to demands 
              and tastes of our local consumers. The introduction of Quwat Jabal 
              in Oman is an achievement on its own as it will be the first 
              market in the region to receive the new citrus flavour from 
              Coca-Cola,&quot; avers Hussein.<br>
              <img border="0" src="dew.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="152" height="210">The 
              tussle in the citrus drinks category, which forms 40 per cent 
              (Coke estimates) of the 52 per cent Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSDs) 
              chunk in the ready-to-drink beverages in Oman, is hardly new to 
              this region. &quot;The Middle East is an important region for 
              Coca-Cola, as it has a high per capita consumption for CSDs,&quot; adds 
              Hussein. That makes it important for Pepsi too, more so because of 
              the local acceptance that Mountain Dew enjoys. For the record, 
              literally translated, Quwat Jabal means 'strength of the 
              mountains', and that is exactly what Coke is banking on against 
              its formidable opponent.<br>
              Moreover, citrus flavour is an important segment as it is 
              extremely popular in Oman, and forms an important ingredient in 
              most local food. The flavour swipes most of urban Oman - Muscat, 
              Sohar and Salalah - and is, according to recent research, most 
              popular among Omani males, especially between the age-group 16 to 
              24. (Interestingly, more than 60 per cent of Oman's population 
              today is below 25.) <br>
              Add to this the fact that Mountain Dew is the undisputed king of 
              them all, gripping as it does over 90 per cent share of the total 
              citrus drink market, and it becomes clear why Coke wants a slice 
              of the citrus pie. With such stiff competition from a formidable 
              and well-established rival, it is an uphill task for Quwat Jabal.
              <br>
              To be sure, this isn't Coke's maiden attempt at toppling the Dew 
              from its perch as market leader. It has challenged the might of 
              Mountain Dew thrice in the past: in 1994, 1996 and 1997, but 
              without the desired results (see box on page 23). Since then, 
              Coca-Cola's share in the citrus drink market, which is relatively 
              small, has been decreasing consistently.<br>
              If one looks at the recent marketing coups in Oman, there's 
              definitely hope for Quwat Jabal. Bridgestone, for one, was in a 
              similar position like Dew with the largest market share in Oman 
              just a few years back. However, intense marketing campaigns by 
              Michelin and Yokohama attacked its leadership position in this 
              market. According to Coke officials, this is the most effective 
              attempt that the company is undertaking to establish itself in the 
              market and loosen the grip of the much-admired Mountain Dew in 
              Oman. <br>
              Besides spreading its tentacles far and wide in the cola market, 
              the Pepsi drink is capable of effective counter-promotions. In 
              such a difficult scenario, Coke has pinned its hope on strong 
              sales tactics with a media blitz, PoP (point of purchase) 
              merchandising and market activity. Or, in the words of its 
              marketing mandarins, the policy of Coke is to follow the rule of 
              thumb for such an intense exercise. Pepsi, on its part, after 
              initially commiting to respond to a mailed questionnaire, refused 
              to comment on the issue despite repeated requests. <br>
              <br>
              <b>The global war</b><br>
              With the Western markets being saturated to the core, the 
              soft-drink battleground has now turned toward new overseas 
              markets. While once the US, Australia, Japan, and Western Europe 
              were the dominant soft-drink markets, the growth has slowed down 
              dramatically, but they are still important markets for Coca-Cola 
              and Pepsi. However, Eastern Europe, Mexico, China, the Middle 
              East, and India have emerged as the new &quot;hot spots.&quot; <br>
              Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have bottling ventures in these places 
              and in other areas where they see growth potential. International 
              marketing can be very complex - many issues have to be resolved 
              before a company can even consider entering uncharted foreign 
              waters. This becomes evident as one begins to study the 
              international cola wars. <br>
              The cola war between Coca-Cola and Pepsi is still raging in the 
              US. However, the two soft-drink giants also recognise that 
              opportunities for growth in many of the mature markets have 
              slowed. Often, the company that gets into a foreign market first 
              usually dominates that country's market. <br>
              Coke patriarch Robert Woodruff realised this 50 years ago and 
              unleashed a brilliant ploy to make Coke the early bird in many of 
              the major foreign markets. At the height of World War II, Woodruff 
              proclaimed that, &quot;Wherever American boys were fighting, they'd be 
              able to get a Coke.&quot; By the time Pepsi tried to make its first 
              international pitch in the 1950s, Coke had already established its 
              brand name and an effective distribution network. In the 
              intervening 50 years, many new markets have emerged.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The local battle</b><br>
              The soft drinks market in the Sultanate is diverse and fiercely 
              competitive. Strong growth generated by fierce competition in the 
              three largest sectors of the market - carbonates, fruit/vegetable 
              juice and bottled water - is increasing the availability of 
              higher-quality products as well as a wider variety of locally-made 
              goods.<br>
              Carbonates is largely monopolised by the two multinational 
              companies PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company. PepsiCo is 
              represented in Oman by Oman Refreshment Company while The 
              Coca-Cola Company's local representative is Al Ahlia Gulf-Line 
              General Trading LLC.<br>
              On the other hand, fruit/vegetable juice and bottled water are 
              highly fragmented segments and witness the presence of players 
              from the Sultanate, Saudi Arabia and UAE.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The new challenger</b><br>
              Most new products when launched are filled with excitement, 
              popularly called the 'initial burst of energy' to push the brand. 
              Quwat Jabal, coming from the house of Coke, is no exception and 
              has been launched with all the air that needs to be noticed. The 
              new citrus drink's outdoor campaigns coincided last month with 
              this story going to Press. In fact, at the time of this story's 
              going into print, officials at the Coca-Cola Company were 
              preparing for the official announcement of the launch of the drink 
              on July 29. Interestingly, the company is not planning any 
              newspaper ads at the moment.<br>
              &quot;Media support for Coca-Cola launches usually comes after a few 
              weeks of the launch. This is to ensure availability of the 
              products across the market before announcing its launch, so that 
              all those who would like to refresh themselves have the 
              opportunity to do so,&quot; states Hussein. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Brand activation</b><br>
              The drink, launched in 300-ml glass bottles, 330-ml cans and 
              2.25-litre plastic bottles, has now been available in the 
              Sultanate for more than a month. &quot;The front-loaded media campaign 
              for Quwat Jabal Incorporates local TV and radio spots, and 
              roadshows whichh will target around 200,000 Omanis,&quot; says Philippe 
              A. Georgiou, public affairs and communications manager, Coca-Cola 
              Middle East. Even as you read this, eight Coke teams are 
              traversing the length and breadth of the country, distributing 
              free trial samples of the drink so as to induce a repurchase 
              later. The image-positioning of the drink is set in natural, 
              outdoor, local, energetic, confident and sporty scenery to appeal 
              to the adventurous Omanis. <br>
              The roadshows for the drink, which will feature the recently 
              retired Hamed Al Wahaibi, the Sultanate's celebrity rally driver 
              with whom Omains will be able to associate, will begin this month 
              and will go on for a couple of months. <br>
              &quot;When it came to the best way introducing Quwat Jabal In Oman, we 
              explored the possibility of using a brand ambassador who had to be 
              someone with a strong local identity that also goes beyond the 
              borders of Oman. Hamed Al Wahaibi is the best representative for 
              our brand as he has a very strong association with the local and 
              regional community through his achievements in the motor sport 
              arena,&quot; says David T. Helou, general manager of UAE and Oman, Al 
              Ahlia Gulf Line General Trading.<br>
              &quot;Wahaibi won the Middle East Rally Championship, just as we are 
              hoping Quwat Jabal will soon be the No. 1 citrus drink in Oman,&quot; 
              hopes Hussein. &quot;The fact that my sport is one that is full of 
              energy and excitement makes me blend well with Quwat Jabal,&quot; avers 
              Wahaibi.<br>
              Maintaining and retaining this acceleration is what will give 
              Quwat Jabal the edge it needs to beat Dew, the market leader in 
              the category. However, there are people who believe that, despite 
              giving the new citrus drink a local name and face, Coke may have 
              missed the bus Says Abhilash Patel, Marketing Manager, Pizza Hut, 
              which stocks Mountain Dew: &quot;As far as the strategy of 
              regionalising and hedging against the Anti-American sentiment is 
              concerned, the Coca-Cola Company is too late. This strategy may 
              have worked a year ago, but not now.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Emulate the enemy</b><br>
              To establish oneself in a new market, the safest strategy to 
              deploy is to follow the leader. Coke, being the marketing genius 
              that it is, knows that only too well. Its strategy of waging the 
              war behind enemy lines is a bet that makes it better prepared this 
              time, and it has certainly learnt its lessons well from the past.
              <br>
              With all the tools of marketing up its sleeves, the company has 
              done its homework well and has kept the overall product packaging 
              similar to Dew's - only a bit more vibrant, if one may say so. 
              That may have been the result of the studies it conducted, which 
              revealed that the Omanis preferred the packaging to portray 
              &quot;naturalness&quot;. Helou points out that &quot;any resemblance between 
              Quwat Jabal and Mountain Dew in terms of packaging is pure 
              coincidence.&quot;<br>
              Yet, even as far as the ingredients are concerned, Quwat Jabal has 
              all of those that go into the making of Mountain Dew. And, as Coke 
              would have the consumers believe, it is healthier than the 
              competition. &quot;Coca-Cola's motivation for launching Quwat Jabal is 
              to provide Omani consumers with a refreshing new citrus carbonated 
              soft drink to revitalise them as it contains real orange and lemon 
              juice to help them keep their natural energy level up,&quot; says 
              Hussein. <br>
              The keyword here being &quot;real,&quot; something that the company arrived 
              after extensive research of its proposed target audience, which 
              was found to be health-conscious. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Seeking higher ground</b><br>
              Despite being bona fide US products, Coke and Pepsi tend to 
              promote themselves as local drinks for local people in Oman 
              without the feeling of Americanisation that is often associated 
              with multinational products from the US. Research by Coke revealed 
              that young people in Oman are very nationalistic, with their role 
              models being masculine, fearless, strong personalities who hold 
              leadership positions. Besides, they are also close to nature - 
              they love the outdoors, whether by the mountains or the beaches.<br>
              Thus, it arrived at a product specially designed for the local 
              taste. The omnipresent lemon flavour and the endorsement by a 
              local celebrity are both bound to tug the emotional heartstrings 
              of the patriotic Omani. That is not to say that Mountain Dew does 
              not understand its consumers well - its advertising definitely has 
              high appeal. In fact, its punch line - &quot;strengthen your heart&quot; - 
              is something most Omains recall when they talk about the product. 
              Mountain Dew's communication is consistent with its brand image 
              and values. It is perceived as healthy, energetic, refreshing, 
              sporty, fun drink for the fearless Omani man with strong national 
              identity and heritage.<br>
              While some of Coke's earlier challenges to Mountain Dew lacked 
              these marketing strategies, this time Quwat Jabal seems to have 
              taken the cue and has tried to give itself a strong identity so 
              that Omanis can form a strong bond with it. Coke is hoping that a 
              local brand name coupled with a local mascot, instead of a Britney 
              Spears or a David Beckham, will help it cash in on this sentiment. 
              &quot;The proposition of Quwat Jabal is to provide sustained 
              refreshment and energy in a citrus flavour. The name of the brand, 
              the juice content and the association with a sport that requires 
              resilience, all contribute to delivering this proposition,&quot; says 
              Georgiou.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Partner support</b><br>
              &quot;McDonald's will support Coca-Cola and its local bottler in the 
              introduction of Quwat Jabal,&quot; says Ali Daud, franchisee for 
              McDonald's in Oman. &quot;At the beginning of August, all our 
              McDonald's outlets are expected to begin serving our customers 
              with this drink.&quot; <br>
              On the other hand, Pizza Hut, PepsiCo's global partner, serves 
              Mountain Dew through its outlets. Says Pizza Hut's Patel, 
              &quot;Mountain Dew is an established brand in the region, and I don't 
              see its sales getting impacted majorly by the launch of Quwat 
              Jabal in fast food outlets such as ours since we stock only Dew.&quot; 
              While Patel might have spoken like a true partner, the fact that 
              Pepsi is present in 24 fast food outlets (15 of Pizza Hut, nine of 
              KFC and three of Hardees) compared to Coke's 10 (five of 
              McDonald's, four of Subway and one of Chilly's) outlets is 
              something that Coke will have to contend with. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Undoing the Dew</b><br>
              Winning consumers is not an easy task. Even if the product is in 
              old garb, there has to be something new for its saleability. After 
              assuming all that Dew has, Quwat Jabal has tried to differentiate 
              itself from the rival drink. <br>
              &quot;Against the current key player within the citrus category, Quwat 
              Jabal is an excellent differentiated product with an exciting, 
              locally relevant marketing mix that will make it a success,&quot; avers

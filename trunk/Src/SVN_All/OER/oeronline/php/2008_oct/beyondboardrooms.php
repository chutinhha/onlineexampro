                <strong>Salma Al Hashmi is an excellent manager at home and office. 
                But for her home comes first, finds out Visvas Paul D Karra</strong><br>
                <br>
                <img src="board.jpg" hspace="8" vspace="6" align="left">It all 
                began as a dream. A dream spurred by her skills and ability to 
                organise parties for friends and family. A degree in international 
                business management gave her further impetus. As days rolled by 
                it became imperative that she could do it and that was when she 
                decided to give up a lucrative telecom job and become an entrepreneur. 
                Meet Salma Al Hashmi, the managing director of Envent, an event 
                management company. For Salma, the most defining moment was when 
                she put in her papers at her secular job and ventured into business. 
                This moment is treasured most in her mind. As an energetic woman 
                who believes in living life in the fast lane, Salma did not believe 
                in complacency or taking it easy as she always wanted to be ahead 
                of the times. Which is why she took up three challenging jobs 
                in three different sectors (hospitality, banking and telecom) 
                before becoming the master of her own career. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Strong fundamentals<br>
			</b>After studying an MBA in London some seven years back, Salma thought 
                it was a good idea to get into the hospitality industry and joined 
                the Intercontinental Hotel group in the UK. After all, Oman had 
                the luxurious Al Bustan Palace Hotel and she hoped that some day 
                she would get to work there.<br>
                <br>
                Sure enough, she managed to land herself in Al Bustan Palace Hotel. 
                But for Salma, things in the hotel industry were a bit slow for 
                her liking and she switched to banking. She worked for National 
                Bank of Oman and when opportunity presented itself, Salma grabbed 
                it and joined Nawras.<br>
                <br>
                Joining Nawras was the turning point for Salma as the telecom 
                company was in the process of setting up its operations in Oman. 
                The Nawras experience of putting a company together helped Salma 
                a lot during the course of time when she wanted to set up her 
                own office.<br>
                <br>
                <img src="boardsm.jpg" width="145" height="155" hspace="8" vspace="6" align="right">When we walk into 
                Salma’s office located in Al Khuwair next to the Muscat Expressway, 
                the lady is busy on the phone. And even as we talk to her, someone 
                is already waiting for her in the next meeting room. One of the 
                obvious and ubiquitous challenges for Salma is balancing between 
                work and family. Although it is a difficult juggle, if asked to 
                make a choice her family would come first. When she reaches home, 
                she mentally switches off everything that is related to her office 
                and dotes on her family. Her two adorable sons are lucky because 
                their mother loves to fuss over them as long as she is around. 
                She makes sure that they get undivided attention all the time 
                right until bedtime. Salma is undoubtedly lucky to get all the 
                support not only from her husband, who himself is a banker with 
                HSBC, but also from her inlaws and parents.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Independent nature</strong><br>
                Her independent nature finds itself manifested in the fact that 
                she wants to do everything around the house on her own, everything 
                except cooking!<br>
                <br>
                “I do everything that I have to do as a mother and wife except 
                cooking,” admits Salma sheepishly. For the cooking, she has a 
                domestic help, who whips up some of the most mouthwatering dishes 
                one can think of.<br>
                <br>
                Salma believes that as society modernises itself, imbibing all 
                the right values in her children by tempering them with the cultural 
                and traditional aspects is important. During her spare time, Salma 
                catches up on her reading when she is not taking a walk on the 
                Azaiba beach. </font></p>

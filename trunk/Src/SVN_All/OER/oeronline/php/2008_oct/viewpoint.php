        <img border="0" src="viewpoint.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="100" height="118">No problem, if you don’t know Puneet Bareja, CEO of Share Gurukul, an 
        intrepid entrepreneur who wisely converted an idea into a business 
        proposition of training and supplying online terminal operators for 
        stockbrokers as the Indian bourses had begun their steep climb three 
        years ago. In a short span, he built two companies – Bulls &amp; Bears and 
        Share Gurukul – and sold it to two big players. How was his journey? “It 
        was a roller-coaster ride. You need to be ruthless to survive. Big fish 
        are always on the prowl to eat smaller ones. Also, you need to be nice 
        to your colleagues to make it big in life,” said the early 40s Delhiite 
        while I visited his office, hardly a kilometer away from the historical 
        Red Fort in Delhi, recently. Simply put, you can’t yell at them even if 
        they transgress limits, according to Bareja.<br>
        <br>
        Bareja’s comments reverberated in my ears as colleague Priya Nair held 
        forth on the same lines while discussing on the issue of ‘man’ – or 
        woman – management subsequently. Leaders always face the problem: how 
        far can you afford to be nice to your colleagues at workplace? How 
        important is it to keep a smiling face even when colleagues tread on 
        your toes? Keep smiling? Dicey questions, no? Afraid to speak up your 
        mind will be detrimental is the new perceived wisdom. <br>
        <br>
        Don’t believe? Listen to Tim Hiltabiddle, author of Nice Guys Can Get 
        the Corner Office: “… have had numerous experiences in my career when my 
        desire to be ‘nice’ and please others hindered my ability to achieve 
        success in the business world, including times when my clients, 
        co-workers and vendors took advantage of my good nature. I have made 
        great strides over the years to get beyond this tendency and have 
        learned to be more assertive, stick up for myself, deal with conflict, 
        set good boundaries, and take more risks.”<br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="viewpoint1.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="5" width="188" height="279">Hiltabiddle, in the run up to his book, surveyed among CEOs and found 
        that the Nice Guy Syndrome (NGS) is a big problem in today’s workplace. 
        “61 per cent of people we surveyed said that they struggle with being 
        too nice at work, and that they feel it has a negative impact on their 
        success.” Top honchos at Procter &amp; Gamble, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 
        Dunkin’ etc. unequivocally supported the Hiltabiddle thesis.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Balancing Act</b><br>
        Leading entails a lot of balancing. One should neither be a dictator, 
        nor a doormat. After all, people are the real assets of any organisation. 
        The enterprise may boast of million dollar worth of machinery using 
        state-of-the-art technology; but these are useless, unless there is a 
        workforce – men and women – to run them. The products these machine and 
        men churn out may be mind-boggling. But in the absence of a sales and 
        marketing team, these great products and services remain in the 
        warehouses. A no win situation.<br>
        <br>
        Organisations need leaders and leaders require people – subordinates – 
        to execute the blueprint for success. A good chemistry between the 
        leader and the led is vital. That’s where the need for the balancing act 
        arises. Hiltabiddle does not mince words: “A balance is needed between 
        empathy and emotional intelligence on one hand and strength and 
        assertiveness on the other. Leaning too far in either direction will 
        inevitably lead to problems for you and others.”<br>
        <br>
        <b>The gender factor</b><br>
        In the light of the fact that a lot more women occupy senior managerial 
        positions these days, what’s Hiltabiddle take on them? Gender does not 
        alter the basics, argues the author. Women certainly face the NGS 
        challenge. In fact, the problem is more acute for them than men. Know 
        why? They are more compassionate, nice and empathetic. “… because of the 
        way they have been conditioned by society, women tend to be more 
        predisposed to be self-sacrificing and want to please others than men.” 
        Maternal instinct kicks in, says the author, in large doses. So, what is 
        the outcome? This makes it “extra difficult to say ‘no’ to a request or, 
        even worse, fire an employee.”<br>
        <br>
        Of course, in the bargain to succeed when women get tough, they are 
        labeled with the ‘b’ word. On the other hand, when men at the leadership 
        position take the same tough road to success, they get away with the tag 
        of a ‘tough and strong’ leader. When men at top try to be compassionate, 
        highly passive, he may be labelled ‘soft’. Succeeding in life is not 
        easy. To get going, you need to be tough in this competitive world. </font></p>

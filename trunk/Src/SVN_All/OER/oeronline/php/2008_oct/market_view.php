                    for the period from August 16 , 2008 to September 15, 2008 
                    wiping out billions of rials in market capitalisation. MSM 
                    index continued to head south losing all the gains in 2008 
                    and down 20.6 per cent in the same period to close below December 
                    31, 2007 closing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Global Liquidity crisis and waning risk appetite of foreign 
                    investors were the primary reasons for the sharp correction 
                    in the regional and emerging markets. Average daily turnover 
                    in the same period decreased by 13 per cent (month over month) 
                    to RO 9.6mn a significant decline compared to average daily 
                    turnover of approximately RO20mn in the first half of this 
                    year. The only sectoral index in black was the services sector 
                    while the other two sectoral bourses turned red, on a year 
                    to date basis. The fall can be attributed to foreigner institutional 
                    investors selling in the market. Foreign ownership decreased 
                    from 30.2 per cent in March, 2008 to 24.4 per cent in August 
                    2008. Though the share of foreign investors in the total market 
                    capitalisation seems small, adjusted for free float holdings, 
                    the stake would go up noticeably.</font><p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

                    <strong>GCC markets turn bearish</strong><br>
                    The GCC markets turned in bearish for the month ended September 
                    15, 2008 and a blood-bath was seen across the GCC bourses. 
                    The overall sentiments in the GCC markets were weak due to 
                    foreigners selling and dropping oil prices. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Doha Security Market was the worst performer and the DSM 
                    20 index plummeted 25.43 per cent pushing it on the number 
                    four position in terms of YTD performance. The industrial 
                    and the insurance indices were the top losers and declined 
                    33.16 per cent and 24.82 per cent respectively. <br>

                    Top executives in the UAE market have come under the scanner, 
                    this coupled with expectations of a correction in the real 
                    estate market impacted the stock market. The DFM and the ADSM 
                    dwindled by 19.40 per cent and 17.20 per cent respectively. 
                    While the real estate index was the common worst performer 
                    on both the exchanges, the banking counters were the other 
                    stocks that got a beating on the DFM and the industrial counters 
                    took up the space in the ADSM.<br>
                    <br>
                    The KSE took a hit of 15.43 per cent and all the major indices 
                    ended in the red. Due to the falling markets the investment 
                    companies took the worst hit and the investment index lost 
                    22.30 per cent from its month ago levels. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Tadawul All Share Index decreased by 11.40 per cent during 
                    the month. The investment and insurance indices declined 21.06 
                    per cent and 15.87 per cent respectively. The Bahrain stock 
                    market was the least affected by the GCC meltdown and the 
                    general index declined 9.40 per cent. The investment and the 
                    banking indices were among the worst performers losing 12.18 
                    per cent and 7.63 per cent

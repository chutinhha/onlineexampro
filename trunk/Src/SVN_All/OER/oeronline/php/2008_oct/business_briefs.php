                    The company would offer three packages for fixed line including 
                    free minutes to fixed lines only. Package-1 would be based 
                    on a rent of RO4.9 with 75 free minutes Package -2 would be 
                    based on a rent of RO7.9 with 300 free minutes, while Package-3

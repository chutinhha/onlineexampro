                    Player is one of the most successful international golfers 
                    of all time. Player has achieved the kind of worldwide acclaim 
                    reserved for only a handful of sporting greats. He is, quite 
                    simply, world class. Player is renowned as much for his dedication 
                    to the principles of excellence as he is for his golfing accomplishments. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Style statement</b><br>
                    A courageous style of play fired by a fiercely competitive 
                    nature, courteous demeanour and a penchant for wearing black 
                    earned him the sobriquet – The Black Knight. He is recognised 
                    worldwide as an uncompromising perfectionist who settles for 
                    nothing but the best. His impeccable set of values, stringent 
                    regimen of health and fitness, and insistence on quality, 
                    have earned him admiration the world over. He was fond of 
                    saying, “The harder you practice the luckier you get.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Player is remembered for 
                    being a member of the modern triumvirate. Player along with 
                    Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer dominated world golf during 
                    the 1960s and early 1970s earning them the title ‘The Modern 
                    Triumvirate’.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;Player, the son of a gold miner, turned professional in 1953 
                    and almost immediately set about dominating South African 
                    golf. When he travelled to England in 1955, he was told that 
                    he did not have what it took to become a s<strong><img src="golf1.jpg" width="184" height="269" hspace="8" vspace="6" align="right"></strong>uccessful golfer 
                    and advised to seek another career. That was just the sort 
                    of challenge which appealed to Player. He returned to Britain 
                    a year later to win the Dunlop Masters in Sunningdale. In 
                    the same year, he won the first of 13 South African Opens. 
                    His approach to golf and life in general mirrors Ben Hogan’s. 
                    He practised and prepared to the point of obsession. He followed 
                    an intense fitness regime. Perhaps to emphasise these qualities, 
                    he dressed in black and it became his trademark.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>On a roll</strong><br>
                    In 1959, he won his first Open, which was his first victory 
                    in the Majors. At the time, he was the youngest ever winner 
                    of that prestigious championship. By 1961, he topped the money 
                    list on the US Tour. In 1965, he beat Arnold Palmer to win 
                    the US Masters and therefore finally winning each of the Majors. 
                    He would go to record 10 Major victories in total. He won 
                    the Open three times, the US Open once, the US PGA twice and 
                    the Masters three times. He has also represented South Africa 
                    in no less than 16 World Cups.<br>
                    <br>
                    Up to the point of joining the Seniors Tour in 1985, Player 
                    recorded 21 victories on the US PGA Tour and had collected 
                    $1.8mn in prize money. He had already won more on the Seniors 
                    Tour and was quickly accumulating more victories.
                    Player is also an accomplished golf course designer. Besides 
                    golf, his other passion is race horses. He owns a stud farm 
                    outside Johannesburg on which he breeds top class horses.</font><p align="right" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">

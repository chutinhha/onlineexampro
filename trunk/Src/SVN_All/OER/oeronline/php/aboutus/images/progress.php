                        the Sultanate of Oman 
                        into a dynamic 
                         and 
                        progressive nation. United Media Services annual publication 
                        – Progress 2009-2010, is a celebration of the 39th 
                        Renaissance Day. Progress, which completes its 15th edition 
                        in 2009, has come to be recognised as the most authoritative 
                        account of the Sultanate’s socio-economic achievements, 
                        at home and abroad. Says HE Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah,

                        made in the different fields. I am sure this book will 
                        be an added value to the achievements made and will help 
                        continue our endeavours to turn His Majesty the Sultan’s 
                        vision into reality.”<br>
                        <br>
                        The latest edition stands out for its exhaustive coverage 
                        of various sectors like Oil and Gas, Banking and Finance, 
                        Capital Markets, Education and Healthcare, Insurance, 
                        Agriculture and Poultry, Retailing, Aviation, Information 
                        Technology, Real estate, Telecom, Manufacturing and Logistics, 
                        Power, Infrastructure, Tourism and Trade. Each of these 
                        sectors are covered in dedicated chapters highlighting 
                        the strides taken by the Sultanate in these areas. The 
                        articles bring readers up to speed with the latest developments, 
                        key financial indicators and the future roadmap for these 
                        sectors. As a picture is worth a thousand words, each 
                        of these sections are accompanied by breathtaking photographs.<br>
                        <br>
                        Apart from top draw articles, Progress also contains contributory 
                        pieces from a number of ministers from various ministries. 
                        HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, Minister of National Economy 
                        and Deputy Chairman of Financial Affairs and Energy Resources 
                        Council says, “Throughout the last few decades, the Sultanate 
                        has made impressive achievements in all walks of life.” 
                        HE Dr Ali bin Mohammed bin Moosa, Minister of Health says, 
                        “The Sultanate’s world-leading position in public healthcare, 
                        as affirmed by the WHO, is the outcome of the visionary 
                        approach of the Ministry of Health in its strategic prioritisation 
                        of primary healthcare, combined with its structured planning 
                        activities undertaken through a succession of Five Year 
                        Plans initiated in 1970.”<br>
                        <br>
                        Says HE Maqbool bin Ali Sultan , Minister of Commerce 
                        and Industry, “The size of foreign trade and direct foreign 
                        investments have witnessed massive developments during 
                        the blessed Renaissance.” HE Dr Rajiha bint Abdulamir 
                        bin Ali, Minister of Tourism avers, “Since 1995, tourism 
                        has seen a massive development in terms of laying down 
                        its regulatory and organisational framework or developing 
                        the tourist sites at the different locations all over 
                        the Sultanate.” Sheikh Mohammed bin Ali al Qatabi – Minister 
                        of Fisheries adds, “The integration among fishing and 
                        other constituents of the Omani economy reflect the economic 
                        growth witnessed by the Sultanate in the last few decades.” 
                        HE Dr Rawiyah bint Saud Al Busaidiyah, Minister of Higher 
                        education echoes the views, “The government has provided 
                        a sound regulatory framework to ensure that the education 
                        process is up to world class standards.” <br>
                        <br>

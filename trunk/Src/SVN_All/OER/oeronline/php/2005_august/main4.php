is a universal value. You can’t impose democracy; that is an oxymoron. You have 
to nurture it and support it, according to Madeleine Albright, former Secretary 
of State in the USA. Albright rose from the comparative obscurity as a daughter 
of Czech Jewishémigrés to become the first female secretary of state and thereby 
the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government. <br>
<br>
She will be addressing more than 2,000 business leaders at the international 
leadership summit, leaders in Dubai, November 28-29. OER is the exclusive media 
partner from Oman for this prestigious global event.<br>
<br>
Talking of democracy and Arab world, she says, “In promoting democratic 
institutions in Arab countries, we should bear in mind that sudden, traumatic 
change is neither necessary nor desirable. Our goal should be to encourage 
democratic evolution, not revolution. Arab countries will, of course, establish 
their own rules for democratic participation. Democratic development in the Arab 
world depends, as it does elsewhere, on internal debates about national 
identity, interests, values and purpose.”<br>
<br>
For eight years, during Bill Clinton's two presidential terms, Madeleine 
Albright was an active participant in the most dramatic events of recent times. 
She is a passionate advocate of civil and women's rights and has followed a 
zigzag path to a career that ultimately placed her in the upper stratosphere of 
diplomacy and policy-making in her adopted country. <br>
<br>
Since leaving office, Albright founded The Albright Group LLC, a global strategy 
firm and she serves on the board of directors of many institutions, including 
that of the New York Stock Exchange. She will appear at Leaders in Dubai 
alongside eight business and political headline names, including Mikhail 
Gorbachev, former leader of the Soviet Union, and former American President Bill 
Clinton (via video cast) will take part in the debate on leadership best 
practices. Also speaking at the event are:<br>
<br>
- Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the former Soviet Union and winner of 
the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize<br>
- Bill Clinton (via videocast), former President of the USA from 1993-2001<br>
- Dr.Mahathir bin Mohamad, former Prime Minister of Malaysia from 1981-2003<br>
- Daniel Pink, the author of Free Agent Nation, the Washington Post bestseller, 
who will suggest six aptitudes crucial to the survival of white-collar workers<br>
- Kenichi Ohmae, the former director of McKinsey Japan, who has earned global 
acclaim as ‘Mr. Strategy’<br>
- Arie de Geus, who was at the helm of Royal Dutch Shell for 40 years and has 
been described as “the global statesman” of business change<br>
- Spencer Johnson, the author of the bestsellers “Who Moved My Cheese” and “The 
One-Minute Manager” <br>
- Scott Bedbury, one of the world’s leading brand architect and the man 
responsible for Nike’s ‘Just Do It’ campaign <br>
<br>
Four of the distinguished speakers at Leaders in Dubai, Sydney and Europe have 
made Amazon.com's &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; by making to Amazon.com’s list of top 25 
authors who have sold the most books through Amazon.com during its 10 years of 
existence. The names include Spencer Johnson, Ken Blanchard, Stephen Covey and 
Marcus Buckingham. Successful, influential authors in their own right, they're 
also some of the most compelling presenters and experts in the area of business 
culture, leadership and personal and professional transformation.<br>

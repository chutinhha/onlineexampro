with local, regional and international banks. The amount will be used mainly to 
prepay existing debt facilities at Sohar Refinery Company (SRC) and ORC ahead of 
the merger of the two companies. The government has decided to merge SRC with 
ORC to create a world-class refining company. The merger will be implemented by 
the absorption of SRC by ORC, which will be renamed Oman Refineries and 
Petrochemicals Company (ORPC). Following the merger, ORPC will be owned 75 per 
cent by the government through the Ministry of Finance, and 25 per cent by Oman 
Oil Company. The move seeks to combine Oman’s two refineries – ORC in Mina Al 
Fahal (Muscat) and SRC in Sohar, which are connected by a 250-km pipeline.</font><br>

        unveiled its display apartments. Located within the fully integrated 
        residential community, the display apartments showcase all that The Wave 
        has to offer in terms of apartment living. The stylish one, two, and 
        three bedroom luxury apartments are set in buildings, which are 
        traditionally styled. The interiors of the apartments have been done up 
        by interior designer Mary Clephane. The apartments have been designed 
        with lots of glass, shaded with partitions and Macrabia (Omani 
        traditional shades) set around their balconies. Modern, spacious, light, 
        and practical, the apartments have been designed to be easy and fun to 
        live in, upholding a relaxed way of life that is enhanced by an open 
        living/ dining/ kitchen layout. Modern stylish kitchens, which are also 
        practical and hardwearing, have been fully integrated with high quality 
        electrical appliances to make life that much easier for the owners. The 
        one-bedroom apartment has a harbour feel, very light, sunny bright, 
        crisp cottons – it’s all about the beach and the sea. The two-bedroom 
        apartment is more contemporary with a deep red shiny kitchen, a black 
        4-poster bed and deep-red leather sofas all on a sand-coloured tiled 
        background. The three-bedroom apartment is more ‘family’ oriented with 
        bags of space inside and outside for the whole family.</font><br>

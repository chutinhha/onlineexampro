</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Rolls-Royce’ new Drophead Coupé<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars recently unveiled the new Phantom Drophead Coupé for the 
first time in the Middle East. With the addition of this car to its range, 
Rolls-Royce now offers three models, including the Phantom and Phantom Extended 
Wheelbase. <b>Axel Obermueller</b>, who is currently responsible for company 
sales in Europe and the Middle East, speaks to OER. Excerpts from the interview:<br>
<br>
<b>Where is the market for you? </b><br>
<img border="0" src="auto2.jpg" width="350" height="226" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">As you can see from 1996 till 2003, the market was pretty stable. Then with the 
introduction of Bentley and the Continental GT, this market was good enough; the 
same is the case with Maserati and the new Ferraris. Suddenly, this segment is 
expanding. We can capture the market segment by say 200,000 plus euros and we 
have a segment share of 33 per cent. Of course, if you look into our wheels 
segment, the cars have sold worth 300,000 plus euros. We already have a market 
share of 58 per cent. This is an achievement, specially as we started this brand 
in 2003. <br>
<br>
The average age of our buyers is already down 10 per cent. And with the new 
products that we are going to introduce, we expect to reduce the average age 
even further. This is very important when we want to look at the new clientele. 
We have traditional clients as well as the ultra high-income group with well 
over US$300,000 plus. In Europe, for instance, we have 23,000 customers and in 
the Middle East we have around 3,000, in the US, we have 35,000. Overall, we 
have approximately 85,000 and the number is growing. So, there is a huge 
customer base for expensive cars out there. We are expecting an increase in our 
customer base and as part of meeting the demand, we are considering options to 
expand our plant. We can either go in for a second line or even set up a double 
shift system. We are also expanding our dealer network. When we started in 2003, 
we had 68 dealers and now we have up to 81. When we ramp up production, we will 
increase the number of dealers a little bit more. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="auto3.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The new car is turning out to be very successful in Oman. The numbers are way 
ahead of what we originally planned. In fact, I can even add and say that as far 
as the convertible is concerned, we don’t have the availability till 2008. 
Whatever allocation we have given to our dealer, Al Jenaibi International 
Automobiles, for 2007 and the first half of 2008, have already been sold. When 
we looked at Oman two or three years ago, we looked at the market and said Oman 
is a motor market and it is a growing one. We introduced small numbers but we 
were able to sell more than what we thought we would be able to sell. And now 
the coupe and the convertible are being planned, we honestly see a lot of 
attention in Oman market. Oman is booming. There are more business people who 
are now getting into the high net worth category, so we see lot of potential for 
our vehicles in the Omani market. <br>
<br>
We have a strong growth in the UAE market. We came to Oman 11 months ago and the 
growth over target was 100 per cent. When we talk about Rolls-Royce cars, Omanis 
are willing to wait up to one year because they don’t need a car. They have 
enough cars with them and they wait up to one year. We have to deliver it on 
time and that is the challenge. <br>
<br>
<b>What has been your experience in the Middle East market?</b><br>
It is a challenging market because the customers are so demanding. On the one 
side, it is more easy to deal with them because it is easy to have access with 
them, which is easier than in Europe. But on the other side, they are very 
specific about what they would like to have, what kind of car, very clear ideas 
about special options, etc. They are very demanding. Middle East in general is a 
very interesting market and not because it has been booming for six or seven 
years and this is still going on. There are so many changes happening in this 
part of the world and it is exciting. <br>
<br>
<b>What is your expectation from the dealer?</b><br>
They are representing the brand. So, this is an important part I think, because 
they have only small number of cars compared to other car companies. So, it is 
very important that the relationship between the dealer and the customer is 
absolutely perfect. The dealer has to provide world-class service because this 
is what the customer is expecting and if the dealer were not providing this kind 
of service then it would hurt the brand.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>What is your forecast for 2008?</b><br>
Well, we are really looking forward to the launch of the coupe, which is going 
to add to the product portfolio. So, suddenly Rolls-Royce is going to be a 
three-model line up as against the one model line up earlier this year. So, we 
expect it will attract a lot of new customers. We also expect that there is lot 
of attention with the brand because sometimes you take a brand for granted. But 
when a new brand is added suddenly, it gives a lot of excitement. We expect lot 
more excitement, widening of our customer base. So, overall as I said, we are 
very excited about where we are really heading with Rolls-Royce. <br>
<br>
<b>How long does it take to make a car?<br>
</b>The actual assembly takes about 20 days. For the decision-making and order 
of the material it may take even eight to 10 months. There are parallel 
processes. So, overall for making a Phantom it takes a minimum of 360 hours. 
Around 40 hours in the woodshop and around 30 hours at other bays. <br>
<br>
<b>Can you tell me in terms of numbers, how many vehicles have you sold in Oman?</b><br>
One of the philosophies of Rolls-Royce is not to talk about individual figures 
for a single market and funnily enough we have got certain traditions as well. 
Some people might remember the times where we never used to talk about the 
horsepower of the car. We would say it is excellent. Globally, in a year we sell 
800 cars, so obviously we cannot sell 500 cars in Oman. The message I would like 
to convey is that Rolls-Royce is now exciting to more customers. What is 
important to stress is that Rolls-Royce too is really excited. Our dealer has a 
managerial resource full time dedicated only to Rolls-Royce. His objective is to 
work with the customer. We don’t go and sell Rolls-Royce cars. We have the 
commitment to be able to take the customers through the acquisition process.<br>
<br>
Advanced orders for the convertible are significant, and preparing our business 
for its arrival is vital to ensure the best possible service for our customers. 
As part of our business development, we recently opened a showroom through our 
partner Al Jenaibi International Automobiles at Al Qurum.

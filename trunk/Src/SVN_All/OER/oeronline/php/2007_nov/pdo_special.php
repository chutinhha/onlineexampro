<b>Abdul-Amir bin Abdul-Hussein al Ajmi, External Affairs and Communication 
Manager, PDO, talks about how the oil and gas major’s communication strategy is 
continuously evolving to meet the changing demands of connecting with external 
and internal communities in a no-holds barred chat with Akshay Bhatnagar<br>
</b><br>
<b>
<img border="0" src="pdo.jpg" width="250" height="237" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">What are your views on the current state of the “communications” industry in 
Oman?</b><br>
The industry is still developing. Oman does not yet have the sophistication of, 
say Dubai, let alone of the western industrialised world. But because the 
industry is developing, there are plenty of opportunities for new publishers, 
design and advertising companies and public-relations agencies. PDO does what it 
can to support such fledgling companies. And when dealing with established Omani 
design and PR agencies, we try to raise their standards.<br>
<br>
<b>What is PDO’s budget for communication?</b><br>
I could tell you what my department’s budget is, of course. But that would be 
terribly misleading, because it covers not only communications activities but 
also those related to social investment. Moreover, many communications 
activities – particularly those intended to keep our staff and contractors safe, 
well informed and motivated – are paid for from the budgets of other 
departments. Finally, as I hope your magazine’s readers will have noted, this 
has been an exceptional year for PDO. We have been running an unprecedented 
communications campaign – including print advertising and television commercials 
as well as the publication of a 246-page historical book – to let people know 
that 2007 represents the 40th year in a row that PDO has been exporting Omani 
crude oil on behalf of the nation.<br>
<br>
<b>Lord Leverhulme, founder of Unilever, once said: “Half the money on 
advertising I spend is wasted. The problem is, I don’t know which half.” Can the 
same be also said about PDO’s communication spend?</b><br>
No, I don’t think so. Unlike Unilever, which sells consumer goods, PDO has no 
products to sell. The company was established right from the start purely as a 
means for finding and producing the crude oil that its shareholders could then 
sell as is or refine into saleable products. Because we are not trying to 
persuade consumers to buy things from us, all our advertising is of a strictly 
corporate nature. It includes advertising to recruit employees or announce 
tenders, of course. But a good share of it is basically corporate image 
building, which in this particular year has concentrated on the longevity of our 
nation-building enterprise. <br>
<br>
<b>How do you measure your returns on investment in communication?<br>
</b>You’ve put your finger on a tricky subject, but we do the best we can. We 
collect data that can give some indication as to the effectiveness of our 
communications. In particular, we conduct biannual surveys amongst our key 
stakeholders – both internal and external – to gauge their “favourability” 
towards PDO. Increasing favourability can be interpreted as evidence of a job 
well done; decreasing favourability means we have to work harder – and perhaps 
more cleverly – in our communications. The surveys also give me an idea of how 
we can boost our reputation. They reveal, for example, which modes of 
communication are most likely to reach the target stakeholders or which subjects 
seem to elicit the most negative or positive responses about the company.<br>
<br>
I also get a good, qualitative idea for what key stakeholders think about PDO 
from the various face-to-face meetings that I personally have with them. I began 
this year with a plan to conduct a series of discussions with selected 
individuals in Government and in our partner companies, including contractors 
and shareholders. I also make a point to talk – and listen – to interior 
community leaders. In fact, my department organises two major engagement 
sessions every year with Government officials posted in interior areas and walis 
– one for the north and the other for the south of the country.<br>
<br>
<b>How is technology changing the communication landscape in your view? How 
easier or difficult has it made your task?<br>
</b>Without question, technology – particularly in IT and telecommunications – 
has transformed my work – as it has virtually all aspects of modern life. And, 
on balance, I will say that it is making it more challenging for me. Take the 
internet, for example. How do you deal “bloggers” who can upload slanderous 
accusations onto a webpage for everyone in the world to see? Well, you can’t 
really prevent them from uploading such things, but at least you can have your 
company’s website rather their blogs be listed in the top 10 results of a Google 
search. That way at least journalists and curious members of the public, both of 
whom rely on Google to get basic information about a company, will get your 
point of view first.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the challenges you face in developing and executing the 
communication plan to meet PDO’s overall business objectives? <br>
</b>Well, I just talked about the challenges posed by technology. But you have 
raised an interesting point: PDO’s fundamental business is not to communicate; 
it is to find and produce oil and gas in a safe and sustainable way for the 
benefit of its shareholders. My job is thus of a supporting nature, as far as 
the company is concerned. But it is vital nonetheless. The work that I and my 
departmental colleagues do secures from PDO’s stakeholders the company’s tacit 
license to operate.<br>
<br>
To communicate effectively with our stakeholders, we must first determine what 
issues are foremost in their minds, then we must implement plans to adequately 
address the issues and finally we must let our stakeholders know that we are 
taking steps to address the issues. Communication is as crucial as the first and 
the last steps.<br>
<br>
In answering your question I should also point out that last year, for the first 
time, we looked more than one year ahead in making our communication plan. We 
invited the company’s leaders, government officials and some external experts, 
and asked them how they saw the company’s business as well as its relations with 
the government, the media and the public in general in five years’ time. From 
those varied discussions, we culled out nine points that would have the greatest 
influence in shaping PDO’s business environment in 2011. We all agreed, for 
example, that the media–even local media–will become more critical. We then 
brainstormed as to how best to evolve the external affairs and communications 
department between now and the year 2011 so that it is well positioned to deal 
with these impending changes. Some of the communications initiatives that we’ve 
implemented this year came from the long-term strategy we formulated last year.<br>
<br>
<b>Generally, oil and gas companies are always under the magnifying glass. As a 
communication expert, how do you ensure that only the right kind of 
communication is passed on to the external community without suppressing 
information?<br>
</b>You are right to imply in your question that there is information that the 
public may want to know but that we simply cannot reveal. For one thing, some of 
the information may be commercially sensitive – oil and gas reserves, contract 
values and the like. I think most people would agree that any company – 
particularly a private-sector company – is entitled to keep that sort of 
information secret. But there is also information that may not be confidential 
per se but will reflect badly on the company, particularly if taken out of 
context. As a defender of the company’s reputation, I have to make sure that 
such information is always put in the proper context if it is inadvertently 
revealed to the public.<br>
<br>
Deciding what should and should not be said by PDO employees is indeed a tricky 
affair. To help me in this task, my department has recently introduced a 
disclosure protocol that has to be followed by PDO staff intending to make 
presentations at conferences. The protocol, for instance, stipulates that the 
Ministry of Oil &amp; Gas, which represents our majority shareholder, has to approve 
the content of such presentations. We also have a media protocol that clearly 
stipulates who in PDO can act as an official company spokesperson.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I must emphasise that the key thing for me is not the 
suppression but the provision of information: clamming up is not an option for 
us. That is why, for instance, we continually put new information on the 
company’s website, which we have recently redesigned.<br>
<br>
<b>Generally, we don’t get to see any negative coverage of PDO in the media – a 
rarity for any oil and gas company. Is it a result of smart PR or are 
publications scared of writing against the largest company with strong 
connections in the right places?</b><br>
I would like to think it is the former. In any case, self-censorship of 
publications – if any – really pertains only to the local media. We certainly 
have not been immune from negative coverage in the Wall Street Journal or The 
New York Times, for instance. Still, we have been taking deliberate steps to 
bring the members of the media over to our way of thinking – what you call 
“smart PR”.<br>
<br>
We have recently invited members of the media to learn about the complexities of 
the oil and gas business. Last year, we explained what enhanced oil recovery was 
all about; this year, we gave them a course on the basics of hydrocarbon 
exploration and production – including a field visit to Fahud, our largest oil 
field. We provide information about PDO to the invited journalists without any 
expectation that they will publish a complimentary article in return. In fact, 
we insist on them not writing anything for publication as a result of these 
courses. Our thinking is that if they better understand the nature of our 
business, then they will be able to put a story in the right context whenever 
PDO has some real news to be reported.<br>
<br>
This year I have made a personal commitment to meet with the chief editors of 
all national and regional publications covering the oil and gas industry. Like 
the courses for journalists, these meetings are not intended for us to impose an 
agenda on anyone. They are intended merely to establish relations of mutual 
understanding and, yes, trust. Ultimately, all I ask these chief editors to do 
is to give us a fair chance to correct the details of any stories that they may 
have picked up from the rumour grapevine before they are published.<br>
<br>
<b>How often are you required to do crisis management from the communication 
perspective? Is there any process in place to keep you, your team and relevant 
people geared up for the crisis management? </b><br>
Without question, we must be prepared for intense media scrutiny in the event of 
a crisis. And that means we must practice our processes. We normally have four 
major corporate crisis exercises every year in which we mobilise our press 
centre: a special room equipped with multiple telephone lines and a fax machine 
from which a trained team can handle the rapid-fire telephone calls we would get 
from journalists in the event of an emergency. We also arrange for our company 
directors to receive what we call “media training”: the exercising of the skills 
necessary to make a good impression to viewers when one conducts an on-camera 
interview in the midst of a crisis. Last year, for the first time, we expanded 
one of our crisis exercises to include Oman Liquefied Natural Gas and Qalhat 
Liquefied Natural Gas, which receive the bulk of the natural gas that PDO 
produces. And every two years, one of our crisis exercises is similarly expanded 
to include the Royal Oman Police and various other government authorities, 
enabling the national emergency response process to be tested.<br>
<br>
This year, you may recall, we had a real national emergency: Cyclone Gonu. That 
particular crisis tested the ingenuity of the press-centre team, because the 
team could not use the press-centre room. Instead, it had to make do with 
makeshift offices outside of PDO’s headquarter buildings and Thureya telephones.<br>
<br>
<b>PDO is credited with many firsts in the country. What are the new 
communication practices that you are introducing in Oman? </b><br>
Thank you for giving us credit for our pioneering ways. Let me give you a few 
examples of things that I have not mentioned so far and that, as far as I know, 
were first introduced into the country – and perhaps even the region – by PDO.<br>
<br>
“Live” video call-in webcasts in which the Managing Director or Deputy Managing 
Director answers telephone calls from anyone in the company – including staff 
based in the interior – for everyone in the company to see and hear on their 
desktop computers.<br>
<br>
An internal webpage, updated every month, in which a video message from the MD 
to all staff is streamed and answers to virtually any submitted questions are 
answered – by the MD himself.<br>
<br>
Training staff – even at lower job levels – in the arts of persuasion, so that 
they can act as unofficial company “ambassadors”, spreading the good word about 
PDO to friends, relatives etc.<br>
<br>
Annual media briefings at which national and international journalists can 
listen to the MD’s presentation on how PDO performed during the current year and 
its future plans, ask questions to him, and receive printed and digital copies 
of his entire presentation as well as supplement documents.<br>
<br>
Celebratory SMS “texting” messages on the occasion of National Day or Accession 
Day (as opposed to announcements of upcoming sales).<br>
<br>
<b>On the internal communication front, how do you reach out to 5,000 strong PDO 
family drawn from 50 nationalities?</b><br>
You’ve again put your finger on a very challenging area. In fact, this was an 
area highlighted during the long-term communications strategy workshop I 
mentioned earlier. One solution, which has proved to be very effective, I just 
listed: the live call-in video webcasts. My department also has the good fortune 
of publishing a newsletter – Al Fahal – that is popular within the company. 
Ironically, we’ve recently learned that sometimes the best way to have an impact 
on a wide variety of people is to narrow communications down by fine-tuning and 
targeting them to specific subgroups of people. But in any case there’s clearly 
a lot more that my colleagues and I can still do, not only to reach every staff 
member but also to make them take positive action on the basis of our 
communications. </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

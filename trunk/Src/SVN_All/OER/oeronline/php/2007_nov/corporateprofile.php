<b>AlArgan Towell Investment is evolving into a major real estate developer with 
a clutch of projects, the latest one being the RO400-million waterfront 
development. OER focuses on this fast growing company in an exclusive report<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="corporate.jpg" width="250" height="282" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">In 1973, WJ Towell &amp; Co. envisioned and developed Madinat Sultan Qaboos (MQS) – 
one of the finest addresses in Muscat. Exactly after 35 years later, the Group 
is again set to make a major contribution to Oman’s burgeoning real estate and 
tourism sector with its twin projects – luxury resort at Al-Kayiran and 
waterfront integrated development in the north of Muscat – at a combined 
estimated investment of around RO500 million.<br>
<br>
The projects are being implemented through a joint venture, AlArgan Towell 
Investment that was formed in 2003 in partnership with AlArgan International 
Real Estate Company, the Kuwait-based real estate development company with 
footprints in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and Lebanon. The joint venture 
had an initial mandate to develop middle-income real estate housing solutions in 
Oman. <br>
<br>
Its first project consisted development of 72 three-and-four bedrooms 
residential villas in Al-Hail, in vicinity to the Muscat City Centre. Priced in 
the affordable range of RO35,000 and above, the villas’ possession was given in 
2006. Currently, their market prices have almost doubled. Moving ahead, in 
pursuit of filling up the gap in the real estate market for middle-income 
segment, the company initiated another project – development of 100 townhouses 
at Al-Hail, located on Al-Barkar Street and close to the sports complex. The 
construction is in full swing and all units have been sold out. Like the 
previous project, the townhouses’ market prices have also appreciated 
significantly. The units, originally sold for RO38,000, are now valued at above 
RO65,000. </font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Giant strides<br>
</b>After making a confident beginning, AlArgan Towell Investment has broadened 
its attention by planning and developing projects on larger scales. The first 
example of its expansion plans is Qurm Gardens – a premium residential and 
commercial complex located in the heart of the city and next to Qurm Natural 
Park. Construction work is going on at the site, which encompasses 40 
residential townhouses, retail and office space to contribute to acute shortages 
currently witnessed in these products. <br>
<br>
“Inspired by the traditional architectural style of Oman, Qurm Gardens offer a 
total harmony between heritage and modernity to satisfy the needs of Omani 
citizens. The units are constructed in various typologies that shape the skyline 
of the neighborhood in a way reminiscent of a traditional Omani village,” said 
Hassan Al Nabhani, general manager of AlArgan Towell Investment. The project was 
adjudged the best architectural design in the CNBC Arabian Property Award 2007 
recently. <br>
<br>
“Apart from Muscat, we are looking at developing different kinds of reasonably 
priced housing infrastructure in Sohar and Salalah,” informed Al Nabhani. <br>
<br>
AlArgan Towell Investment have also been working diligently with the Ministry of 
Tourism, concerned government authorities, and impressive teams of international 
planners, architects, engineers, environmentalist, and operators to introduce 
large-scale integrated world-class developments in Oman. A water and beachfront 
project, just north of Muscat, at an estimated cost of RO400 million is 
currently planned. For the first time, the company will be targeting 
expatriates, besides Omanis. Spread over an area of 620,000 sq m, it will have 
tourism, residential, entertainment, leisure, commercial and retail facilities 
with the aim of founding a vibrant community for people to live, work, shop, 
rest and play. At least three hotels are also expected to come up there. The 
company is aiming for starting construction in the first quarter of 2008 after 
meeting the statutory requirements.</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
<font face="Verdana" size="1">At the core of this growth are values that enshrine developing Omani art and 
culture and preserving and caring for the environment ensuring sustainable 
development. The design is conceived such that minimal impact is there on the 
serene environment. Sea water is to be invited in land to create an inland 
marina with water front development that would accentuate and pronounce even 
more the natural beauty of the site. Negative environment impacts of extending 
breakwaters and land reclamation shall be brought down to the bare minimum. The 
facility will aim to work with government to spread awareness of the importance 
of preservation of the natural habitat and environment that Oman is endowed 
with. <br>
<br>
The inland marina with almost 100,000 sq m area will cater for around 150 berths 
and provide extended water frontage to the residents of the development. At the 
top end, it will have luxury water and beachfront villas. Then there are 
residential units like townhouses, small villas and apartments for local 
middle-income segment, the company’s original focus market. Office, shopping, a 
promenade with dining and recreational facilities to make living an enjoyable 
experience, are part of the project. Tourists who like to be in a setting with 
communities and relevant facilities around them would find a lively and active 
setting. Yet for those who seek to immerse in nature, in a quite, tranquil 
secluded ambience would find accommodation, spas, and amenities to serve them 
with a high degree of luxury and service.<br>
<br>
<b>Foray in hospitality</b><br>
“Al-Kayiran Resort is an exclusive, environmentally friendly resort in a 
heavenly crystal blue secluded natural bay, with a design that has witness a 
spectacular receiving from both the general public and leading architectural 
professionals in the recently held CityScape exhibition in Dubai. The design has 
been hailed for its subtlety, minimalist approach, attention to site detail, and 
inhibiting the site rather than imposing upon it providing a continuation of the 
natural features of site” Al Nabhani said.<br>
<br>
“The world class luxury hotel resort offering no more than 82 keys brings to 
Oman one of the most prominent luxury hotel operator in the world with awards 
and accolades that testify to level of excellence of their properties and 
service philosophy. The construction is expected to start by the first quarter 
of 2008. Most of the clearances are in place. It will be ready in two years time 
thereafter,” Al Nabhani added. <br>
<br>
The plan sounds fantastic but it will be interesting to see how this property 
shapes up as at least two other major players – Sama Dubai and Orascom – are 
also coming up with their own properties in the vicinity. With the thrust on 
developing tourism in Oman and the success of The Wave, and given the growing 
demand for affordable housing, AlArgan Towell Investment seems to be on the 
right track.</font></p>

<img border="0" src="gcc14.jpg" width="225" height="133" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"><font face="Verdana">Airbus has delivered its first finished A380 superjumbo jet to Singapore 
Airlines, 18 months behind schedule. The construction of the A380, able to carry 
up to 800 passengers, has been beset by persistent and costly delays. It has 
also been overshadowed by allegations of insider trading against managers at 
parent company EADS. Singapore Airlines took delivery of the double-decker plane 
at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse. Airbus has stated that it is on track to 
meet its target for A380 deliveries in 2008 and do not envisage further delays. 
To meet its revised production schedule, Airbus must hand over 13 completed 
planes in 2008 and four every month in 2009 and 2010. Delays to the flagship 
project have cost Airbus US$8.5 billion and analysts believe the planemaker must 
now sell 420 models to make a profit on it. It currently has 189 confirmed 
orders and tentative sales agreements in place.<br>

Global FDI nears $1,500bn record <br>
</b></font><font size="1"><font face="Verdana">“Global inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) are 
on track this year to surpass the record US$1,411 billion seen in 2000 despite 
the turmoil in financial markets, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 
said. The Geneva-based agency’s annual World Investment Report showed that FDI 
inflows amounted to US$1,306 billion in 2006 – the highest since 2000. UNCTAD’s 
secretary-general Supacha Panitchpakdi, however, said that financial instability 
and high energy prices made the forecasts uncertain.<br>
<br>
The US has regained its position as the favourite destination for foreign 
investors… but developing and former communist countries had their fastest 
growth in investment last year, driven by cross-border mergers and acquisitions. 
Investment flows into developing countries rose 21 per cent from 2005 to US$379 
billion in 2006.<br>
<br>
At US$36 billion last year, foreign direct investment in Africa was double its 
2004 level because of improved prospects for corporate profits and a more 
favourable business climate. But Africa’s share in global foreign direct 
investment dropped to 2.7 per cent from 3.1 per cent in 2005. The largest 
inflows to developing economies were to China, with US$69 billion. Among 
transition economies, the largest inflows were to the Russian Federation, with 
US$29 billion.</font><br>

Google health platform in 2008 <br>
</b></font><font size="1">
<img border="0" src="gcc15.jpg" width="200" height="129" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4"><font face="Verdana">Google plans to bring its immense data storage and 
organisation capacities to the field of medical care and patient records, 
Marissa Mayer, the company’s head of search, said at the Web 2.0 Summit. Telling 
her audience to “expect a lot of activity in the coming months,” Mayer said that 
the long-expected Google Health initiative will formally appear in early 2008.
<br>
<br>
“The health care industry generates a huge amount of information every year. 
It’s a natural core competency for us, to understand how to organise all that 
data,” she said. As in other areas of its business, Google faces a formidable 
competitor in the race to bring the resources of the Internet to personalised 
health care in the form of Microsoft. <br>
<br>
Earlier this year, Microsoft acquired Medstory, a startup specialising in search 
software optimised for finding health information. Microsoft has not publicly 
disclosed its plans for a health-related product, but is said to be working on 
an offering that combines software with an online component. <br>
<br>
Google has developed a prototype online platform for its health offering that 
incorporates personal medical records, health care-related search features, diet 
and exercise regimens, a localized “find a doctor” application, and other 
elements, Mayer confirmed. The company has shown the prototype to unspecified 
partners and is having both Google employees and “trusted testers” beta-test the 
system.</font><br>

<img border="0" src="gcc16.jpg" width="175" height="152" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4"><font face="Verdana">Greenpeace International has criticised Apple’s iPhone, saying it includes 
hazardous materials that other mobile phone makers have eliminated. Greenpeace 
has accused Apple of toxic chemicals in its products and post-sales electronics 
recycling in the past as well. Greenpeace claimed that an analysis done on a 
disassembled iPhone by an independent lab in the UK found toxic brominated 
compounds and hazardous PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in multiple components of the 
handsets. Bromine, a chemical used in fire-retardant compounds, was present in 
more than half the 18 samples taken while toxic phthalates made up 1.5 per cent 
of the ear bud cables’ PVC coating. <br>
<br>
“Apple is far from leading the way for a green electronics industry as 
competitors like Nokia already sell mobile phones free of PVC,” said Zeina 
Alhajj, Greenpeace toxics campaigner, in a press statement. The group also 
criticised Apple for not offering a global take-back recycling policy to match 
those of Nokia and Sony Ericsson. <br>
<br>
In its most recent ‘green’ ranking of major consumer electronics and computer 
companies, Nokia and Sony Ericsson topped the list last month at number one and 
number two respectively, with corresponding scores of 8.0 and 7.7 out of a 
possible 10.0. Motorola, with, 6.7, took ninth. Apple, meanwhile, held 12th 
rank, with a score of 5.3. Only one company, Panasonic, scored lower. The lab 
analysis of the iPhone can be found on the Greenpeace website. </font> </font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

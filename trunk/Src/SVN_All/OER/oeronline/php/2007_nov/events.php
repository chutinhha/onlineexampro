</font>
</b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Muscat has become the latest city to host 
‘The Night of the AdEaters’, the world-renowned international advertising 
festival<br>
</b><br>
<img border="0" src="ad5.jpg" width="250" height="170" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Oman 
was treated to ‘The Night of the AdEaters’, the fabulous worldwide 
‘advertainment’ show, dedicated to showcasing creative advertising from across 
the globe on a giant screen set in a crazy atmosphere! Since its origin in 
France in 1981, ‘The Night of the AdEaters’ has grown into a global phenomenon, 
with shows in more than 160 cities. Held at the Palm Gardens in the Muscat 
InterContinental Hotel on October 24-25, the show was presented by Nawras.<br>
<br>
Bank Sohar, Times of Oman and Al Shabiba were associate sponsors of the event, 
which was brought to Oman by Applause Events, The Event Specialists, a division 
of United Media Services LLC. The other partners included H!, FACES, Al Youm al 
Sabe, Oman Printers &amp; Stationers Ltd, Infoline, AXA Insurance, Oman Air, Samsung 
Electronics, Citizen Watches-Sarco LLC, Capital Stores, Business International 
Group, A’Saffa Poultry, Tanuf-National Mineral Water, Red Bull, Pizza Hut, Al 
Mudhish and Al Shatti Plaza.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="ad4.jpg" width="250" height="170" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="4">The 
two-day extravaganza was packed with corporate honchos, students, specially from 
Sultan Qaboos University, homemakers, professionals and people from all walks of 
life. Over 2000 AdEaters turned out for the sold-out shows on both the days. 
‘The Night of the AdEaters’ was a great opportunity to loosen up and relax in a 
fun-filled ambience. The audience soaked in the non-stop entertainment – a 
spectacular show reel of amazing advertisement commercials that left the crowd 
asking for more. Some advertisements were funny, few hilarious and the rest 
thought provoking. <br>
<br>
<b>Total entertainment </b><br>
<img border="0" src="ad2.jpg" width="250" height="170" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Besides 
the display of world-class advertisements, the crowd was enthralled with 
different forms of exciting entertainment. Shock’n’ Knock was an altogether 
different kind of an experience for the audience. The troupe had the gathering 
spell-bound with electrifying break dancing performances. The rhythmical Drum 
Circle, performed by Dubai-based group, was mesmerizing. With an assortment of 
64 drums, the Drum Circle turned out to be a an interactive magical, musical 
group experience that Muscateers will never forget and talk about for months to 
come. To make the evening more pleasurable, the crowd was provided with 
whistles, party poppers and drums. With a perfect weather and clear sky, serial 
lights illuminating rows of palm trees and refreshments kiosks around, it was a 
perfect ambience to unwind and enjoy.<br>
<br>
<b>Bouquets all round</b><br>
<img border="0" src="ad1.jpg" width="250" height="170" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="4">Narrating 
his experience Khalfan Al-Taley, Deputy General Manager and Head of Retail 
Banking, BankSohar said, “It was an amazing show. As it is the first time the 
show is being conducted in Oman, I thoroughly enjoyed the event. The commercials 
were world class. Shock ‘n’ Knock troupe performed extremely well. The Drum 
Circle, with their rhythmic percussion was a trance. I could see the oneness all 
over the Palm Gardens. The event was well organised and I am happy about the 
whole thing.”<br>
<br>
Usama Karim AL-Haremi, Manager - CC&amp;M, Oman Air said, “What a great experience 
it was. The show was fabulous. I attended the full show for two days. The 
excitement was all over. The SQU students came in batches and they encouraged 
the Shock ‘n’ Knock troupe. The troupe is very professional and all of them were 
Omanis. They have toured UK and Europe with their daredevil performance. The 
commercials were of international standards and we were lucky to see and enjoy 
the same. Why only an annual affair? I suggest we should organise the shows at 
least twice a year. Showcasing such a world class event goes to show that Oman 
has come of age. The Sultanate is booming and firing from all cylinders.”<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="ad3.jpg" width="250" height="170" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="4">Ajay 
Ganti, GM, SARCO said, “Overall it was a nice experience. The commercials were 
excellent. It was nice to see so many youngsters from SQU, taking part in big 
numbers. Otherwise, there will be the same set of corporate faces for all 
events. For the next event, we should add more variety like quiz competition, 
etc. I liked the show.”<br>
<br>
Hemant Pajankar, GM Business International Group said, “The show was a great 
success.”<br>
<br>
Ross Cormack, Nawras CEO, said, “Nawras was delighted to support AdEaters and 
most grateful to UMS for the opportunity to be part of another exhilarating 
‘first’ in the Sultanate of Oman. The innovative evenings were extremely well 
organised and a fantastic experience for all those who had the pleasure of 
attending. Nawras is known for being creative and for setting trends and 
AdEaters was the perfect entertainment event for this award winning mobile 
operator to proudly participate in. Both AdEaters and Nawras celebrate the 
promotion of creativity with the resulting combination considered a huge success 
by the audience on both evenings.”<br>
<br>
The Night of the AdEaters’ had its final show on October 25. Raffle draws were 
conducted, with fabulous prizes such as a 32” LCD TV, DVD Players, MP3 Players 
and Camcorders from Samsung, Citizen Eco-Drive watches, gift vouchers from 
Capital Store LLC and Pizza Hut.</font></p>

</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Transparency deficiency in GCC</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
<b>The GCC countries need to take action on their low global ranking according 
to Transparency International, writes Dr Jasim Husain Ali</b><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="closeup.jpg" width="153" height="278" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4">The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are not transparent enough by world 
standards. Except for Qatar, most GCC countries lost to other countries in the 
2007 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) published by Transparency International 
(TI). Certainly, the authorities must come up with certain remedies in order to 
reverse the poor global ranking.<br>
<br>
The CPI is measured on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher numbers indicating less 
corruption. According to the 2007 report, Denmark, Finland and New Zealand were 
collectively regarded as the most transparent economies in the world by virtue 
of scoring 9.4 out of the maximum 10 points index. Conversely, Myanmar and 
Somalia were viewed the least transparent, having scored only 1.4 points each.<br>
<br>
Established in 1993, Germany-based TI issues an annual report ranking countries 
on the basis of perceived corruption. The 2007 report ranked 180 countries and 
territories, some 14 more compared to the year earlier report. China, Hong Kong 
and Taiwan are included independently in the report. Some 159 and 146 economies 
were ranked in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The trend suggests that smaller 
economies or less open countries are increasingly finding value in getting CPI 
ranking. Undoubtedly, transparency or lack of it is one of the variables that 
investors use while evaluating investment choices in different countries.<br>
<br>
<b>Elaborate research<br>
</b>The index is compiled on the basis of several surveys and polls. Reviewed 
economies earn points based on perceptions expressed by business and academic 
professionals concerning ways of doing business in various countries. The 
respondents, which include local and expatriate residents, provide views about 
possible corruptive practices involving public officials with regards to winning 
business preferences such as contracts. In fact, the report cares about detailed 
matters such as payment of commissions or paid vacations and other offerings 
made to officials in order to win business deals or special favours.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="closeup2.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">Undoubtedly, CPI is not entirely objective, as respondents express their 
perceptions subjectively. However, the report relies on numerous studies 
conducted by internationally renowned establishments. These include the World 
Bank, Economist Intelligence Unit, Freedom House, World Economic Forum, Asian 
Development Bank and African Development Bank, to name a few. The 2007 report 
was based on findings of 14 surveys and expert assessments.<br>
<br>
A minimum of three studies is required for any nation to be included in the 
report. No country had all the 14 surveys. Indonesia allowed for 11 surveys, the 
highest in the latest report only to be followed by India with 10 surveys. On 
their part, GCC states boasted either four or five surveys. The UAE, Bahrain and 
Kuwait allowed for five surveys.<br>
<br>
<b>Qatar leads</b><br>
Qatar topped the GCC list having scored 6 on the 10-point scale and was placed 
32 in the overall list. In fact, Qatar had achieved the same points and ranking 
in 2006 report. However, it was UAE’s retreat that allowed Qatar to outperform 
fellow GCC member states. The UAE scored 5.7 points in 2007 report, down from 
6.2 points in 2006, slipping three places and moving down to rank 34 globally. 
It was, however, the second best amongst GCC and Arab states at large. <br>
<br>
Still, Bahrain plunged 10 positions to No. 46 after scoring 5 points in the 
latest report versus 5.7 points in 2006. Also, Oman continued its downward trend 
after losing similar points. The Sultanate was ranked No. 53 in 2007 report, 
down from No. 29 in 2005 report, when it was the best amongst among GCC states. 
Likewise, Kuwait lost 14 positions and moved down to 60th ranking. For its part, 
Saudi Arabia lost nine positions and thus ranked number 79 globally.<br>
<br>
The report grouped Bahrain and Oman amongst nations suffering from significant 
worsening of perceived corruption levels in 2007. Others include in the same 
category are Austria, Bhutan, Jordan, Laos, Macao, Malta, Mauritius, Papa New 
Guinea and Thailand. Conversely, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, 
Dominica, Italy, FYR Macedonia, Romania and Surinam made the most significant 
gains.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>Remedies </b><br>
TI argues that economies scoring below 7 out of 10 must take immediate actions 
to bring integrity in the dealings of public officials. “Low scores in the CPI 
indicate that public institutions are heavily compromised,” argues the report. 
Anyway, as in 2006 report, merely 22 nations achieved a score of at least seven 
points. The report concluded that the “top scores of wealthy countries and 
territories, largely in Europe, East Asia and North America, reflect their 
relatively clean public sectors, enabled by political stability, 
well-established conflict of interest and freedom of information regulations and 
a civil society free to exercise oversight.” As to the Middle East in general, 
the 2007 report said the results “make clear that corruption and lack of 
transparency still constitute a very important challenge for development of the 
region. “The GCC states are required to take concrete actions to fight 
corruptive practices at all levels. Amongst other measures, the authorities 
should encourage civil societies exercising oversight of malpractices of public 
entities and business dealings.” </font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

<b>Oman’s Best Brands is a product of one-year field research and follows the 
publication of Top Brands in Oman in 2005 and Success Stories of Omani 
Entrepreneurs in 2004 by Hasan Kamoonpuri. Excerpts<br>
</b>
<br>
<img border="0" src="oman.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="150" height="222">Over the last decade, more and more Omani brands have been able to beat global 
giants not only on the home turf but also in international markets thanks to a 
radical change in the level and nature of branding activities among Omani 
organisations across all product and service categories. <br>
<br>
‘Made in Oman’ brands have been evolving fast to make their presence felt in the 
international market. Brands like Amouage perfumes, Bahar and Sana detergents, 
Antara batteries, Raha mattresses, Minara cooking oil, Oman Cables, Nabil 
biscuits, Waq shoes, Tanuf and El Jabal El Akhdar mineral water, Suroor and 
Pofak chips, Sohar and A’Safwah milk, Nakhal juices, and Hotex water heaters, 
that a few years ago would have only retreated in the face of competition from 
international giants, have now been able to penetrate export markets and carve a 
out their own niche in the international stage. They are now able to meet the 
standards set by their international counterparts. <br>
<br>
Omani organisations realise that if they want to retain their share in the 
expanding home market and then penetrate export markets, they need to abandon 
some of the traditional practices of branding. One indicator of this willingness 
to change is the increased interest in new methods of branding. With CEOs and 
their marketers being directly involved in branding exercises, there is a 
growing desire and enthusiasm to align all organisational activities behind the 
brand. Entrepreneurs realise that brand popularity drives nearly two-thirds of 
customer purchases. <br>
<br>
The government too is playing an active role in promoting the branding concept 
through its Origin Oman Campaign on the one hand while at the same time 
encouraging excellence through the prestigious His Majesty’s Cup and Certificate 
for the Best Factories. Thanks to these initiatives, Omani brands today enjoy 
strong emotional appeal among customers not only in the Sultanate but also 
abroad.<br>

<b>What are the highlights of Oman’s Best Brands? </b><br>
Oman’s Best Brands begins with a 26-page introduction on key branding concepts. 
It then expands on these concepts and illustrates their successful application 
in the Omani market. A brand survey across 14 product categories with a list of 
Best 50 Brands is noteworthy. <br>
<br>
<b>Are companies in Oman becoming more brand conscious? </b><br>
A fast growing economy and a rising number of affluent consumers have pushed 
Oman into the league of most brand conscious countries. As the Sultanate’s 
market opens up, brand-building is becoming more critical for business success 
than ever before.<br>
<br>
<b>This year’s edition carries a brand survey. Did the survey throw up any 
surprises? </b><br>
Yes. The sector that came out as central to the brand survey was not from any 
consumer goods but deals with a service firm. Many home-grown brands have come 
up and some even edged out global giants.<br>
<br>
<b>Are there any particular brands that in your opinion are role models for 
others to emulate (in terms of branding success)?</b> <br>
Oman Mobile is the No.1 brand because at its core is great innovation, constant 
engagement of the youth, and an ability to bring warmth and passion to all its 
clients. Also brands such as Bahar, Amouage, Raha, Minara, Dana, LuLu, 
BankMuscat, Oman Air, Suroor and Sadolin are successful in creating emotional 
bonds with consumers by developing tailor-made solutions to meet their needs.

<img border="0" src="COVER-STORY5.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="173" height="250">It took me 10 years to convince my father (Maqbool Hameed al Saleh, Chairman, 
OHI Group of Companies) that we should move from a five-and-a-half day working 
week to a five-day week,” says Amaar Maqbool al Saleh, Executive Director, OHI 
Group of Companies. Having lived in England for over 10 years, Amaar was 
conditioned to a two-day weekend; he had also seen the efficiencies that a 
five-day week resulted in. Years of persuasion finally bore fruit in May this 
year when the group decided to go in for a five-day week. </font></p>
<p align="justify">

<font face="Verdana" size="1">
<br>
<img border="0" src="COVER-STORY1.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="173" height="250">Look closer and the anecdote reflects a few important trends. One, the younger 
generation is bringing in new sensibilities to family run businesses – from a 
five-day week to improved workflow, they are leaving their unmistakable imprints 
on almost every aspect of business. Second, most businesses are going through a 
transition as the younger generation takes on a bigger role. And finally, these 
leaders are not just playing a seminal role within their business but are also 
emerging as opinion makers of society at large. Cool and confident, articulate 
and ambitious, suave and savvy, the blue-blooded generation next has all the 
attributes to make it to the higher echelons of the corporate sector. <br>
<br>
<b>Change agents</b><br>
Going back to work processes, these new leaders are charting a new course in 
their respective businesses. A few examples here will be sufficient. A 
mathematics and computer services graduate from UK’s Richmond University, Hani 
Al Zubair, Member of the Board, the Zubair Corporation, felt that he was not 
utilising his educational and professional qualifications to the fullest as 
marketing manager at Hani Automotive in the mid 1990s. Hani had cut his teeth in 
the field of finance at Quaestus Investment Bank in Switzerland and later on at 
the Morgan Grenfell Bank (now part of Deutsche Bank) in the UK. He had further 
sharpened his finance skills as an investment analyst at Ominvest. Driven by 
this zeal, he set about the task of setting up an investment division within the 
head office. His efforts saw the division first grow into a separate department 
and then into Al Hilal Investments. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="COVER-STORY3.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="173" height="250">Hani had not only brought in an investment paradigm but also built up an 
additional revenue stream for the corporation. “The first generation builds a 
business while the second generation consolidates things to get optimum 
returns,” he says. Speaking about building a business, Nailesh K Khimji, 
director, Khimji Ramdas, was thrown into the deep pool right after he graduated 
from the American College of Le Rosey in Switzerland in 1994. He was asked to 
join Khimji Ramdas’ biscuit and cookies start-up in Dubai. He spent the next 
five years learning the ropes of manufacturing cookies and packaging material, 
and then building up the marketing strength of the business. In 2000, he took 
over as the CEO of the unit. The company in question is Strategic Foods of Dubai 
and Nailesh is credited with establishing the business from scratch to a leading 
postion across the globe. When Strategic Foods was sold to Britannia Industries 
of India (along with Al Sallan Food Industries) towards the end of 2006, it had 
a presence in 78 countries and stellar brands like Baker’s Pride and Nutro in 
its kitty. “We took these brands from nothing to around the world with the right 
product, design and packaging,” he says.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="COVER-STORY2.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="173" height="250">A western education and work experience abroad with multinationals gives 
generation next a first hand experience. Says Lujaina Mohsin Darwish, joint 
deputy managing director, MHD, “The new generation definitely brings fresh 
thinking into the business. They tend to look at things differently; may be it 
is the education or their exposure to the business world, which was not 
available earlier. The new generation uses this exposure to build up their own 
business models.” <br>
<br>
Not satisfied with playing a role within their family business, most of them are 
keen to take on a bigger role in the larger civil society – their presence and 
influence can be seen in political forums, quasi-government outfits and social 
welfare organisations. Having made their mark in business, they are keen to 
broaden their horizons and give back to society. Probably, deep down there is 
also a desire to move out of the family fold and prove their mettle on a bigger 
stage. Thus, Imad Kamal Sultan, director, W J<img border="0" src="COVER-STORY4.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="173" height="250"> Towell &amp; Co, is a board member of 
NBO and Director of the Omani India Joint Committee at Oman Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry (OCCI). He has been playing a seminal role in promoting business 
ties between the two countries. Lujaina was a member of the Majlis A’Shura and a 
member of its executive committee. She has been chosen by Forbes Arabia amongst 
the 50 most influential Arab women in 2004 (Rank: 42), 2006 (Rank: 13) and 2008 
(Rank:21). Nailesh is an active member of the Young Presidents Organisation 
Middle East. Natasha Nasib, Business Development Director, Snowhite, has 
recently been chosen as a member of OCCI’s Women’s Committee, “Since this 
appointment was by a Royal Decree, it shows that I can go outside the family 
business and make a mark,” says Natasha.<br>
<br>
<b>Challenges on the way </b><br>
The onus of having to prove themselves is something that the new generation 
faces even in their own businesses. The oft-levelled charge of occupying a 
position because of their lineage rather than their achievements is something 
that they are conscious about. “People who have never dealt with us will always 
say that we got to where we are because of who we are,”says Hani, “This is one 
reason why it is difficult for me to stand up in any forum and tell aspiring 
entrepreneurs, look at me and you can become like me.” Against this, he feels 
that people within the organisation have seen him grow through the ranks and has 
thus earned their respect. “Your colleagues and peers have seen you grow and 
they recognise your value systems and this in a way puts a stop to this issue at 
least within the business,” he adds. <br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="COVER-STORY6.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="173" height="250">The need to earn a position is also important from an efficiency point of view. 
As a newcomer to a business, one is prone to be dependent on subordinates and 
managers, who have spent more years in the company and know more about the 
business. If a family member starts heading a company from day one, he would be 
vulnerable to being manipulated by his managers and subordinates. Says Maqbool 
Hameed, Amaar’s father, “If you bring him in as a director from day one, he will 
burn himself out; one needs to put him in a place where he can grow up the 
ladder.” <br>
<br>
Realising this most family-owned companies insist on inducting the new 
generation through a gradual process. Imad worked as a trainee marketing 
executive at Spinney’s in Dubai in 1995 before being inducted into the company 
as Business Development Manager of Matrah Cold Stores (MCS) in 1995. He went on 
to become the retail marketing manager in 1999 and assistant general manager, 
MCS in 2001. Says Imad, “My father (Kamal Abdul Redha Sultan) told the manager 
at MCS not to treat me any differently from our the other employees.” Hani 
started at Zubair Automotive as a marketing clerk in 1992 going on to become the 
managing director of the investment and automotive divisions. <br>
<br>
As most family-owned businesses have been established by a preceding generation, 
the new generation is at times seen as lacking the same entrepreneurial drive as 
their former generation. Says Hussain Jawad, Chairman W J Towell, “As most of 
these youngsters are born with a golden spoon in their mouth, they lack the 
level of seriousness as the older generation.” While giving due credit to their 
fathers and forefathers, most generation next entrepreneurs are quick to refute 
the allegation of a lack of entrepreneurial spirit. Says Nailesh, “If large 
companies remain a significant factor, this means that they have been growing. 
Otherwise they would have become smaller or would have vanished.” There may be 
some merit in this argument as statistics do prove that only three per cent of 
family-owned businesses survive beyond the third generation internationally. If 
a Khimji Ramdas or a W J Towell is into the fifth generation, then they must 
surely be doing things right. <br>
<br>
While no one disputes the fact that doyens like Dr Mohammed Al-Zubair, Mohsin 
Haider Darwish and Maqbool Hameed al Saleh built up empires through their hard 
work and entrepreneurial zeal, generation next feels that they are bringing in a 
focused approach to businesses. “The first generation were workaholics, while 
the second generation wants to spend wealth, sleep more and spend time with 
family,” says Hani in jest. <br>
<br>
The new generation looks at business more from an investment point of view 
rather than an operational point of view. Says Imad, “It is easy to make money 
when things are going up, but for me it is important to make money when the 
economy is slowing down.” To be fair to the new generation, most family-owned 
companies have become bigger since they have got involved. For example, when 
Natasha joined Snowhite in 1994 there were 20 odd retail shops, this had grown 
to over 40 shops by 2008. Amaar has contributed to the OHI Group’s electronics 
business and helped its foray into radio with Hala and Hi FM. Generation next is 
also driven by a strong sense of legacy. Says Nailesh, “Every generation wants 
to develop a line of business which is associated with them, so building 
something new is almost a personal goal for all of us.” Others feel that it is 
just a matter of time before the new generation gets its due recognition. Says 
Ammar, “It will take another five to ten years for our contribution to be 
recognised.”<br>
<br>
<b>Co-existence </b><br>
Issues like the age difference between two generations can pose a stiff 
challenge at times. When Imad became a W J Towell board member in 2002 at the 
age of 30, the difference between him as the youngest board member and the next 
member was a yawning 17 years. “I had never dealt with them (his uncles) in 
business and it was difficult for them to accept me too, but as we went along 
our comfort levels increased,” reminisces Imad. In Zubair Corporation, there is 
a 15-year difference between the eldest member of the next generation and the 
youngest. This creates the challenge of aligning everyone’s priorities. <br>
<br>
“We know what is right in the long term and how to go about it, but we still 
need to agree on how to do things,” says Hani. A great sense of pride in the 
business and family ties plays an important part in resolving any issues that 
may crop up from time to time – family lunches to get-togethers provide a forum 
for pent up feelings to be resolved. The Zubairs and Salehs of OHI try to catch 
up with each other over lunch. “While our parents are in town, the family has 
lunch together four to five times a week. If someone has a grievance, things get 
sorted out,” says Hani. In the Khimji Ramdas Group, there are weekly review 
meetings and family gatherings regularly. These get togethers work as a soft 
induction for youngsters into the family mould. <br>
<br>
Such interaction also ensures that the succeeding generations grow up with the 
same value systems. Despite a difference in viewpoints, the new generation is as 
conscious about their legacy as the previous generation. “We will never take a 
decision that will undermine our name or image,” says Nailesh.<br>
<b><br>
Transition times</b><br>
Driven by this sense of legacy, the new generation is also working on 
restructuring the family businesses. Imad is working closely with his uncle 
Hussain Jawad on revising W J Towell’s family constitution, which was written 
way back in 1990. The revised version will take care of issues like the 
constitution of the board, shareholding patterns and rules of induction into the 
family business. The group is looking at bringing in rules for the sixth 
generation, like members having to gain two to three years of experience outside 
the family business before joining the group. Says Imad, “We are working on a 
restructuring of the group to bring in a process driven environment.” Khimji 
Ramdas went in for a restructuring of the organisation in August 2007. The group 
is working on a family constitution in consultation with UK’s BDO. The Zubairs 
too underwent a similar restructuring with family members moving to the board. 
The group is also putting in place a system for inducting the third generation.
<br>
<br>
Raised on the right value systems and driven by a strong sense of legacy, the 
new generation is sure to take family owned businesses to greater heights. Their 
share of voice and influence within their business and in the outside realm is 
here to grow.</font></p>

<b>Hussam Technology Company has been pushing the envelope with its cutting-edge 
technological solutions, says Mayank Singh<br>
</b><br>
Had it not been for slow data uploads, Hussam Technology Company would never 
have happened. Says Dr Firas al Abduwani, CEO Hussam Technologies, “While I was 
doing my doctorate at Delft University in Netherlands, I used to generate one 
gigabyte of data per day and I needed to share that data with my research 
collaborators in the US and Brazil. Uploading this data from the Netherlands to 
the US took 120 seconds to upload in 2002. If I tried to do the same in Oman it 
would take me four days to upload the same data.” The yawning gap between the 
ICT (information and communication technology) developments in the Netherlands 
(or UK) and Oman convinced Firas that there was a crying need to upgrade things 
in his country.<br>
<br>
<b>Starting off</b><br>
Abduwani forayed into business with a plan to establish a Wireless Internet 
Service Provider (WISP) in Sohar Industrial Area. AATCO (Ali and Abdul Karim 
Trading Company) was facing a communication bottleneck between its head office 
in Muscat and its factories in Sohar. The company had invested money in a 
state-of-the art ERP system. As the company’s sales team was stationed at Muscat 
and the production team was in Sohar, the servers at these places were supposed 
to mirror each other. Theoretically, once the sales team fed an order into the 
database the production team was supposed to start working on it. The system 
required a 256kilobit per second link between the two servers. But at that point 
Sohar only had a dial-up facility that offered speeds of 30 kilobits per second. 
This forced AATCO to fall back on a manual process &#8722; each of these departments 
in Sohar and Muscat made an incremental backup of the database everyday and sent 
it by courier to the other place. “So they had snail mail or mule mail when they 
had a state-of-the-art IT infrastructure,” says Abduwani.<br>
<br>
In 2004, the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA) gave an in-principle approval 
for a WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) in Sohar Industrial Area to 
cover the factories as the Royal Decree of 2002 (which liberalised technology 
related rules) had mentioned that there will be secondary players who could buy 
bandwidth from Omantel and resell it. The only bottleneck was that the 
regulations were not ready at that time and it was estimated that it would take 
three months for the rules to be in place. This window allowed Abduwani to go 
back to Netherlands to finish his PhD. Once back, he created a business plan and 
proposed it to a set of investors and Hussam Technology Company (HTC) was formed 
in 2005.<br>
<br>
He found that the regulations were still not in place and the TRA reckoned that 
it would take another three months for the regulations to be finalised. 
Desperate to move on, Abduwani got permission from the TRA to do a demonstration 
of his technology to factories in Sohar. The demo came at a price &#8722; the 5 
gigahertz spectrum, which was free in the US and Europe, carried a license in 
Oman and companies had to pay for using the spectrum. HTC paid the spectrum fee 
for three months and installed the requisite equipment at Sohar Industrial 
Estate.<br>
<br>
“We did the demo and shuttled the video as we were not allowed to transfer data 
and give individual packages to factories. We connected different CCTVs of 
various factories to the network, enabling people to shuttle videos on their 
laptop at speeds of up to 20 megabits. Thus we created a fast fabric that could 
create a bandwidth for all the factories,” says Abduwani. Finally, after six 
months of doing demos, HTC gave up the initiative as the grapevine was that the 
rules would take another two years to be finalised. This proved to be true as 
the regulations got ready only in August 2007.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="technology2.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="300" height="204"><b>MESH technology</b><br>
The effort though was not a complete waste as the generated domain expertise 
convinced Abduwani to upgrade HTC from an ISP to a system integrator as there 
were companies that required a private network to connect their different 
buildings. The company invested a large part of its paid up capital of RO100,000 
in a sister company that invested in US entities with such technological 
capabilities.<br>
<br>
HTC had actually created a MESH network in Sohar. There are three different 
architectures for wireless connectivity – one, point-to-point like a leased line 
with the two points connecting directly to each other; second, 
point-to-multipoint with one base station being accessed by multiple clients, a 
GSM network being a good example; and third, MESH wherein there are multiple 
base stations that are interconnected to each other and to the clients’ site. 
This does away with the need to pull cables.<br>
<br>
HTC exhibited the MESH network in various conferences attracting interest from 
companies like Intel, BTC, etc. One of the clients at that point was servicing 
the account of H H Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, and 
they were looking for similar specifications. HTC was asked to replicate the 
demo done at Sohar at the Palace. The demo was approved and the technology was 
deployed in one of the royal camps.<br>
<br>
<b>Taking wings</b><br>
<img border="0" src="technology3.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="285" height="196">Things started falling in place for HTC. Medco, an oil company which had a 
number of rigs in the Karim West concession area (of around 650 sq. km.) from 
PDO, wanted to interconnect these rigs. While Medco was contemplating the option 
of using V-Sats from Omantel to connect their rigs to the head office, HTC 
offered them a solution based on MeshDynamics’ mesh solution. Says Manoj, senior 
support engineer, Netcare systems (the company which was helping Medco find a 
solution), “A V-sat connection at 2mbps speeds was working out to RO10,000 per 
month. We started looking for a solution that was cost effective and wherein the 
data transfer would take less time. But could not find one till we found HTC and 
its Mesh solution.” The company won the deal in face of competition from Omantel 
and managed to deliver the solution. Five permanent towers with solar panels 
with wireless equipment and antenna were erected on the site. Two temporary 
masts were installed on one of the rigs so that every time a rig moved Medco 
just needed to reorient the antenna to the nearest tower and it automatically 
connected to the network.<br>
<br>
HTC went on to a complete wi-fi coverage for the University of Nizwa using a 
trapeze solution. “They had a dysfunctional WLAN network which was not fully 
optimised,” says Abduwani. The University wanted HTC to guarantee its 
performance and give them a solution that was manageable, scalable and secure. 
The company installed a trapeze network system which provides wi-fi coverage to 
students, both indoors and outdoors. This was the first distributed controller 
system deployed in the Sultanate. The University wanted to track where the 
system was being used so that it could improve its service and reduce abuse of 
the system. Says Turki al Yahmadi, network administrator and networking 
instructor, University of Nizwa, “It is reliable, fast and secure. Though it 
covers a larger area it is easy to deploy and monitor.”<br>
<br>
<b>Free Space Optics</b><br>
HTC is also the only company in Oman which is approved by the TRA to install 
Free Space Optics (FSO). FSO is a wireless telecom equipment which is not based 
on radio frequency but on free space optics or lasers. These laser divers of 
1850 and 1550 nano metre wave length are very good for short haul distances of 
up to 4 kilometres and they provide very high bandwidth of one gigabits of 
speed. The best part is that being based on light it dies not requires any 
spectrum licensing.<br>
When Nawras Telecom wanted to try out a new technology as an alternative to 
Harrup because of spectrum constraints, HTC offered them a ‘try and buy’ offer. 
As per the offer, HTC was given certain targets and if those were achieved, the 
technology was considered to be a purchased good. Nawras wanted to see how far 
the links went plus a one STM- 1 speed (155 megahertz speed). “We commissioned 
the system 10 days before Cyclone Gonu hit. Nawras wanted to see whether the 
system works in different weather conditions. They chose the summer season as 
they considered it to be the worst time but they got the entire range &#8722; extreme 
rain, a tropical storm and the dusty weather that followed,” says Abduwani. The 
link operated flawlessly throughout the storm.<br>
<br>
Post-Gonu, BankMuscat decided to upgrade the link between its disaster recovery 
centre at Wadi Kabir and its data centre at its head office (in CBD). The bank 
had connectivity between the two sites but post-Gonu it was keen on upgrading 
speeds. Omantel offered a fibre connectivity while HTC pitched in with a 
wireless connectivity. Since wireless distance between the two sites was smaller 
than the fibre route, it did not have to go through much active equipment. 
Finally, HTC won the bid and implemented Oman’s longest 1 Gbps wireless link. 
“The deal worked out to be 96 per cent cheaper than what was being offered by 
our competitors,” says Abduwani. Clearly, determination and cutting edge 
solutions have enabled HTC to withstand overwhelming odds to come out trumps.

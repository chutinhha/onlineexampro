				The Sultanate of Oman faces several challenges in the healthcare

				Oman’s Ministry of Health recently declared that it is currently 
				working on a number of significant healthcare projects at a 
				total cost of more than RO73mn in an effort to develop the 
				healthcare services for citizens in the Sultanate.<br>
				<br>
				There are at least three major hospital projects currently 
				underway – the RO50mn Psychiatric Hospital Project; a Heart 
				Disease Centre and Magnetic Resonance Unit in Salalah, costing 
				around RO18mn; and the third being the National Centre for 
				Genetic Health, worth around RO5mn. The health ministry also 
				said that in coordination with the private sector, it is working 
				to establish a number of projects related to health quality, 
				which amount to RO40mn.<br>
				<br>
				The ministry is also carrying out a number of other projects 
				related to health centres and other rehabilitation and expansion 
				projects as part of its seventh Five-year plan at a total cost 
				of more than RO60mn.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Growing demand</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
				<br>
				A report by Alpen Capital suggests that the overall GCC 
				healthcare service market is valued at a little over RO7bn and 
				is expected to grow to RO20-22bn by 2020 equivalent to a nine 
				per cent CAGR over the next 10 years. This means that more 
				healthcare services will be required on aggregate as well as per 
				capita. This is not only due to a growing population but also 
				because the Gulf baby boomers born during the region’s first oil 
				price boom will enter the aged category.<br>
				<br>
				The proverbial ‘an apple a day’ will no longer keep the doctor 
				away as there are other factors also that drive the demand for 
				healthcare services in the future. Communicable diseases such as 
				malaria and tuberculosis have been substantially controlled 
				through increased hygiene and higher availability of vaccines. 
				However, while there is a decline in communicable diseases, a 
				huge jump in lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular ailments 
				and diabetes related diseases has exposed the need to augment 
				the supply of hospital beds for the growing demand for medical 
				care.<br>
				<br>
				According to WHO reports, the number of diabetic patients in the 
				GCC is expected to increase 2.5 times the present number by 2030 
				with Kuwait and Oman leading the pack. Consumption of unbalanced 
				diets and a more sedentary lifestyle, thanks to urbanisation and 
				growing per capita income, are aggravating the prevalence of 
				lifestyle diseases. One can safely add that coronary problems 
				and obesity-related complications are also on the rise.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Private participation</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Despite the active public-private partnerships in the healthcare 
				of Oman, the industry is characterised by low private sector 
				penetration. A majority of the private healthcare providers are 
				polyclinics and there are only three private hospitals in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				Murat Soner Kucukkaya, hospital administrator, Muscat Private 
				Hospital (MPH) predicts that the private sector is going to be 
				the leading health services provider. His firm belief is based 
				upon increased public expenditure, combined with deliverable 
				high quality private health services.<br>
				<br>
				As hospitals like MPH continue to invest in modern technology 
				and cutting edge medical equipment to complement their already 
				established healthcare services, an ever increasing number of 
				patients trust and recommend the treatment received at private 
				hospitals. Kucukkaya, who came to MPH from Acibadem Healthcare 
				System, Istanbul, Turkey, previously held positions as hospital 
				director.<br>
				<br>
				Kucukkaya states that MPH, is a 72-bed general medical hospital, 
				established in 2000, and the first private facility in Oman 
				providing cardiac surgery services. Strategically located in 
				Baushar, the hospital provides out-patient and in-patient 
				facilities and has diagnostic and treatment capabilities with 
				state-of-the-art acute-care facilities; CCU, fully-equipped ER, 
				Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, MRI, and a 64-slice CT 
				delivering cardiac angiography, colonoscopy, lung and 
				neurological imaging.<br>
				<br>
				“Government hospitals historically have been associated with 
				anecdotal accounts regarding long waiting lists. The public are 
				no longer ready to wait in long queues when fast, affordable, 
				dynamic healthcare is available at the point of entry to the 
				hospital, and patients are looking in our direction and identify 
				with our vision,” Kucukkaya observes.<br>
				He further feels that if one had to look at this scenario from a 
				wider angle, then there is a lot of scope for greater 
				public-private participation. Governmental policy decision to 
				include private hospitals in the country into the list of 
				referral hospitals, which presently is limited to big government 
				hospitals in the capital area of Muscat, will facilitate greater 
				public choice and autonomy.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Investments in 
				infrastructure</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Almost 75 per cent of the total healthcare expenditure is being 
				incurred by the State but the private sector lags behind in 
				establishing hospital infrastructure. But, as the economies of 
				the region grew on the back of high oil prices and multi-billion 
				dollar investments go into various other sectors like real 
				estate, manufacturing etc, expatriate labour was added to the 
				local populace. Consequently, the market for healthcare services 
				increased which in turn brought out the necessity for more 
				hospital beds.<br>
				<br>
				Al Raffah Hospital was established by Dr Moopen’s (DM) Group in 
				Muscat around two years ago. The DM Group has recently rebranded 
				its healthcare vertical as ‘Aster’ to integrate the current 
				brands of hospitals, polyclinics, pharmacies and diagnostic 
				centres at 95 locations under one name. Aster interfaces with 
				existing and new customers through Aster Hospital, Aster Medical 
				Centre, Aster Pharmacy and Aster Diagnostic Centre.<br>
				<br>
				According to Seeniya Biju, senior manager, Al Raffah Hospital, 
				DM Healthcare is the first private sector organisation to be 
				recognised by government organisations, all major companies, 
				corporate and embassies in the country. In order to cater to the 
				growing demand for medical care, Aster has major expansion plans 
				in Oman, informs Biju, while also stating that the word Aster 
				means flower in Greek. True to its meaning, Aster is flowering 
				in Oman. After Al Raffah, Aster opened a super-speciality 50-bed 
				hospital in Sohar, which was inaugurated by Dr Azad Moopen, the 
				founder of DM Group.<br>
				<br>
				Biju states that the Vision 2015 of the DM Group involves 
				investments of $500mn all over the GCC region. Out of this, 
				$27mn will be invested in Oman to build three hospitals, 15 
				medical centres and 15 pharmacies.<br>
				<br>
				“The private hospitals and medical centres in Oman are in great 
				demand because of the long waiting periods at the government 
				hospitals in Oman. Otherwise, the public healthcare facilities 
				are world class in the Sultanate. Another reason is that there 
				is shortage of doctors and paramedical staff in the government 
				medical centres,” explains Dr Sanjay Dalal, chief manager, 
				activities and promotions of KIMS Oman Hospital (KOH) located in 
				Darsait while talking about the recent growth of private health 
				care facilities in the country.<br>
				<br>
				KOH, which opened in June 2009, is a milestone in the private 
				sector health care of Oman with its 50 beds and equipped with 
				excellence in healthcare delivery. KOH is the protégé of Kerala 
				Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), a prestigious 450-bed 
				multi super-speciality tertiary referral hospital from Kerala, 
				India. KIMS India is accredited by ACHSI (Australian Council on 
				Healthcare Standards International) NABH, ISO for its Quality 
				Healthcare Services. The KIMS Healthcare Group has medical 
				centres in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar.<br>
				<br>
				International affiliations or accreditations lend credibility 
				and respect, inspiring confidence among patients of all 
				nationalities. MPH is managed by the UME Group – an 
				international hospital management group with more than 28 years 
				experience in the Middle East and the UK – and is leading the 
				way by incorporating international accreditations in their 
				current business objectives. <br>
				<br>
				Infrastructure expansion has also been undertaken by polyclinics 
				as well. In the past five years, Badr Al Samaa Polyclinic has 
				opened branches outside Muscat in places like Barka, Nizwa, Sur, 
				Sohar etc. Similarly, Dubai-based Welcare Hospital and India’s 
				Apollo Hospital have also set up their affiliates in Muscat.<br>

				super speciality services, partly because of government 
				regulations and partly because of the lack of demand caused by 
				demographic reasons, which does not justify the investments.<br>
				<br>
				Some of the inpatient and outpatient services provided by 
				private hospitals include cardiology, orthopaedics, neurology, 
				general medicine, woman’s health, urology, paediatrics, general 
				surgery, dermatology, endocrinology, ENT, gastro-enterology 
				ophthalmology, anaesthsiology, family medicine, plastic and 
				cosmetic surgery and dentistry.<br>
				<br>
				Apart from that, other hospital services also include 24 hrs 
				emergency and trauma care, 24 hrs pharmacy, telemedicine, 
				corporate services, ambulance services and clinical 
				laboratories.<br>
				<br>
				Government regulations do not permit all private hospitals to 
				offer super-speciality surgery services like cardiac bypass and 
				critical services; chronic and potentially life-threatening 
				diseases like cancer for example. The exception is MPH which is 
				Oman’s first private hospital to start a cardiac surgery 
				programme for the correction of cardiac disorders.<br>
				This cuts both ways because while hospitals say they have less 
				demand for such critical services, most affluent citizens and 
				resident expatriates go abroad or to their home countries for 
				specialised treatments citing inadequate facilities in Oman.<br>
				<br>
				But some of the hospitals are apparently excelling in what they 
				do. Biju of Al Raffah says they were able to successfully 
				conduct a knee replacement surgery on a 73-year-old. Further, Al 
				Raffah offers consultations only by prior appointment in order 
				to differentiate itself from other polyclinics, says Biju but 
				that does not mean they will reject any walk-in patient if the 
				situation demands. Talking about the cost of treatment, Biju 
				adds that expatriates and even Omani residents should fully 
				utilise the services provided by the local hospitals instead of 
				hopping on a plane and flying to some other country. If one 
				takes into account the expenses incurred for air tickets and 
				stay, the costs would amount to the same.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Insurance is the key</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>

				<b>
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CC3300">
				<img border="2" src="images/sep_health2.jpg" hspace="9" style="border: 1px solid #808080; " vspace="12" align="right"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">KOH is one of the best private hospital in the country with its 
				own custom-built 50-bed hospital, claims Dalal when asked about 
				the services provided and cost of treatment. “We have all the 
				facilities that any hospital can boast of and people have now 
				come to know about the excellent treatment that we give to our 
				patients. We are doing all kinds of surgeries including neuro 
				and laproscopy in three state-of-the-art operation theatres,” 
				says Dalal.<br>
				<br>
				“Many companies are now giving health insurance to their 
				employees. Even then, most people are not confident about the 
				medical services here. Recent reports have indicated 20,000 
				Omanis travel to Bangkok annually for treatment. Therefore the 
				need of the hour is to strengthen your own hospital facilities 
				to attract patients,” Dalal points out.<br>
				<br>
				Differing from Biju, Dalal says the cost of treatment is going 
				up mainly because the profile of players involved in medical 
				care has changed drastically. Previously it was only the doctors 
				who used to decide the type of treatment but now the main 
				players are the insurance companies who are interfering with the 
				workings of hospitals and doctors. It has reached such a sad 
				state that a doctor has to take pre-approval for all kinds of 
				facilities to be provided to patients, right from admitting a 
				patient, the type of treatment and even the kinds of medicines. 
				How can doctors work under such circumstances? Therefore, the 
				cost of treatment has gone up, says Dalal, mincing no words.<br>
				<br>
				The most hurting factor is that while the West is trying to 
				reform healthcare and insurance systems, we are trying to get 
				into that same situation which they are trying to avoid, Dalal 
				adds. Hopefully, this scenario would change soon.<br>

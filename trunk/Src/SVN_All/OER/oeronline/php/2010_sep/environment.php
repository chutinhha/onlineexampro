				is the A progressive step towards a better tomorrow, Green 
				Technology is gradually gaining ground in the hospitality sector 
				of Oman. Already implemented in European countries, the idea is 
				catching up in this part of the world. Recently, Park Inn Muscat 
				was certified as having met the requirements of the Green Globe 
				Standard. First in Oman, and second in the Middle East region, 
				the hotel, a part of the Rezidor Group has earned the Green 
				Globe seal of approval which stands for the highest quality in 
				sustainable practices within travel, tourism and allied 
				industries across the globe. Recognised by travellers, Green 
				Globe is associated with companies who strive to upgrade their 
				immediate environment through energy saving, recycling and waste 
				minimisation. The four basic criteria for ensuring best 
				performance are sustainable management, corporate social 
				responsibility, conservation of cultural heritage and 
				environment. <br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Responsible business</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				Situated in the heart of the capital city of Muscat, Park Inn, 
				with its soothing facade and vibrant interior, attract travelers 
				from all over the world. It enjoys a good reputation amongst the 
				business community for its spacious meeting rooms and splendid 
				living quarters. There is also another reason for its popularity 
				-- its environmental performance. <br>
				<br>
				“This is what is called Responsible Business,” says Sushant 
				Pawar, chief engineer, Park Inn Hotel. He further explains, 
				“Every company has corporate social responsibility. We named it 
				Responsible Business. It is all about doing business while 
				taking responsibility for the welfare of the community. One way 
				of doing it is by striving to reduce the negative impact on 
				environment.” Pioneering the green cause, Pawar has initiated 
				effective green measures within the Park Inn premises, which has 
				helped Park Inn in clinching the award.<br>
				<br>
				One of them is monitoring the conditions of the vehicles of the 
				vendors every month whose products Park Inn purchases for 
				consumption. As for its water policy, it is the first hotel in 
				Oman to have installed faucet aerators in all its guest rooms, 
				public toilets, showers, taps, on which it is making around 12 
				per cent saving on overall water consumption. The safety of 
				drinking water is ensured by a regular monitoring done by the 
				municipality. Salt is now used for swimming pools <br>
				instead of chlorine, which is not always suitable for skin.<br>
				<br>
				To make it energy efficient, Park Inn has also replaced the 
				normal spotlights with LED lights, thereby reducing energy 
				consumption considerably. The building itself has eco-friendly 
				materials like the green ply. For waste management, the hotel 
				has initiated paper recycling through a local company. Going 
				beyond its immediate premises, Park Inn has involved itself in 
				beach cleaning. Planting saplings features among the green 
				initiatives in the coming months. In compliance with local 
				legislation and regulations, Park Inn is doing the needful for 
				the green cause.<br>
				<br>
				Out of 248 standards, it is mandatory for a company to achieve 
				51 per cent of these to be certified by Green Globe. Park inn 
				has gone beyond this limit and achieved 75 per cent of 
				compliance, which is the second highest in the region. Green 
				Globe is a US-based certification body which has accredited 
				auditors in every region who verify the documents online.It is a 
				third-party verification in line with ISO 19011 standards for 
				auditing sustainability management systems. <br>
				<br>
				To meet the specifications of the certification and fully 
				understand the extent of the job to be done, Park Inn management 
				had to strive to train its personnel in environmental concerns. 
				Mobilising fund was not difficult as it involved no major 
				investment, though changing the behavioural pattern of people 
				was time-consuming. <br>
				<br>
				To keep the good work going, it is important to assess the level 
				of customer satisfaction, which is often a pointer to the 
				hotel’s environmental performance. Park Inn takes the help of an 
				online process called Middealia, whereby a guest logs on into 
				the website as he checks out and gives his feedback on his stay 
				in the hotel. That acts as an alert, through which customer 
				dissatisfaction can be taken care of. In Europe where the green 
				awareness is at a higher level, a survey shows that customers 
				have preference for green hotels even at higher prices. In 
				Oman’s tourist initiatives, going green can obviously prove 
				beneficial for the hospitality sector.<br>
				<br>
				</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Collective 
				responsibility</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				<br>
				“Protecting the environment is a collective responsibility. 
				Other hotels in the city are also trying to get Green 
				Certification, though in Oman we need more awareness for the 
				Green cause,” says Pawar.<br>
				Francois Galoisy, the general manager of Park Inn, who has 
				supported the new measures, is hopeful of the new trend in Oman. 
				He says, “This certificate is going to help our tourism 
				initiatives. We would like others to follow the same step. 
				Oman’s scenic beauty is a definite crowd-puller. But on top of 
				that if our business is clean and our operations are 
				sustainable, it will tell the world that we are respectful of 
				our environment. Oman can surely become a responsible green 
				destination for travelers and tourists.”<br>

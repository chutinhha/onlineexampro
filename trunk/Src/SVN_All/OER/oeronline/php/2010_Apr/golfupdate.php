					GOLF lived upto its promise of being the biggest event in 
					Oman’s corporate calendar<br>
					</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<b>Virendra Agarwal, CEO of Moosa Abdul Rahman Hassan &amp; Co, 
					was the last man on stage to receive his award for the day! 
					And rightfully so. The announcement of the winner of the 
					coveted top prize in the 6th Edition of OER CEO GOLF was 
					kept for the very end of the prize distribution ceremony.<br>
					</b><br>
					Before the announcement of the Champion of the Day, Hayyan 
					Al Lawati, was declared the Most Promising Golfer-To-Be, and 
					was presented a Rolex wristwatch by Khimji’s Watches.<br>
					<br>
					Contacted later, Agarwal said, “I play golf only on the 
					green. And considering this debut of OER CEO GOLF on the 
					greens here at the amazing Muscat Hills Golf &amp; Country Club, 
					for me this win means much. We’ve had a great day, and a 
					wonderful evening, and I am sure all of us look forward to 
					being together again next year, with more people joining 
					in”.<br>
					<br>
					</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="1">
					<img border="0" src="images/Golf_New_Logo.jpg" width="100" height="247" vspace="4" hspace="9" align="right"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Great 
					start<br>
					</b>That was pretty much the general sentiment at the end of 
					a day that began for many as early as 6.30 am. Given the 
					inaugural tee off by HE Rumhi, Minister for oil and gas, was 
					scheduled for 8.30am, all the pros were keen to take 
					positions early and be ready to move on to the greens.<br>
					By 9.30, they were off. For them, the steadily rising 
					sharpness of the sun’s rays, just beginning to hint at the 
					onset of summer days in Muscat, were to be relished stroke 
					after stroke. As they made their way towards the end of 
					their respective score cards, points and positions occupied 
					lower positions compared to the thrill of playing on green, 
					the corporate bonhomie firing each one of them to do better 
					with every hole over the 18-hole championship course.<br>
					<br>
					Over lu</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">nch, some said 
					their game could have been better. Others were mindless of 
					the scores, more enthusiastic about exchanging notes of a 
					different kind with the many corporate honchos - now the 
					hallmark of OER CEO GOLF. Alongside, Muscat Hills had their 
					star trainers run newcomers to golf through a golf clinic. 
					Teeing off, putting and driving – there were lessons that 
					took nearly 200 participants through just practice, practice 
					and practice. At the end of the clinic, there were many 
					converts, and the raison d’etre for OER CEO GOLF gets a 
					fillip. Budding golfers will soon become pros.<br>
					<br>
					Before the evening celebrations, again, there was a spot of 
					fun for the pros and their spouses. For the first time in 
					Muscat, people got a taste of Water Golf. Put the ball on to 
					the green; missed? Fish out your ball if you wish! It was 
					fun of a different kind around a game that’s usually known 
					for its serious, businesslike garb.<br>
					<br>
					With golf clubs stored away for the day, it was time for 
					people to let themselves go. The evening entertainment and 
					awards ceremony venue was decked colourfully with most of 
					Oman best brands, all ardent supporters of OER CEO GOLF in 
					some way or another. And, as foot-thumping music filled the 
					ears, there were breaks for the eyes to feast on too. From a 
					wondrous performance in martial arts traditions from Kerala 
					in India, to whirling dancers from Dubai, Caramba(!), guests 
					wove their way between tables to friends ‘on the other side’ 
					and back to their own via the elaborate buffet and 
					refreshment centers. It was time to let one’s hair down. 
					Tomorrow’s a Friday!!<br>
					<br>
					The revelries went on till late before the curtain came down 
					on the 6th Edition of OER CEO GOLF, played for the first 
					time on greens at the Muscat Hills Golf &amp; Country Club. 
					Apart from the venue partner, a host of big brands also 
					supported the most glamorous networking opportunity of the 
					year.<br>
					<br>
					Nawras Business Solutions were official presenters of this 
					year’s OER CEO GOLF in association with National Bank of 
					Oman. Partnered by BMW, Rolex from Khimji’s Watches were 
					again the time keepers for the event. Other brands that 
					proudly participated as category partners included Times of 
					Oman and Al Shabiba (Publicity); Hi, Al Youm Al Sabe and 
					Faces (Media); Jet Airways (Travel); Capital Stores &amp; 
					Samsung from SARCO (Prizes); Al Turki Enterprises, Green 
					Olive Enterprises &amp; Matharoo Trading &amp; Contracting (Venue &amp; 
					Décor); OUA (Beverages); Signature Magazine (Luxury); 
					Buzzword (PR); Reach (Activation); AXA (Insurance); Infoline 
					(Call Centre); Oman Printing &amp; Stationery (Printing); 
					Aggreko (Energy); Al Sawadi (Hospitality), Cybex(Fitness), 
					AATCO, Al Marai, Tahini &amp; Muscat Sports.</font></p>

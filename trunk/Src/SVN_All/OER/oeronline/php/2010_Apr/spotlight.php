				your tyres. Here is a guide to help you make the correct choice</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
                <br>
                </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>When the time comes 
				to change your vehicles tyres, selecting just the right ones for 
				your vehicle is an important decision. Your safety, as well as 
				driving enjoyment over the next years and thousands of kilometre 
				will be determined by this decision. So, to make your decision 
				just a little bit easier, here is a guide to help you choose 
				just the right tyre to suit your car and driving style.<br>
				</b><br>
				<b>Deciding on a number<br>
				</b>When the time comes for you to change your tyres the very 
				first thing that you need to decide is how many tyres you really 
				need. Since tyres affect the performance of your vehicle, all 
				four tyres should be as identical as possible or handling 
				problems may arise. Because of this, the only time that you will 
				be required to change a single tyre is if your other tyres have 
				a lot of remaining tread depth and the one you need to replace 
				has been damaged by an accident, road hazard or a vandal. Even 
				then you should replace it with a tyre that exactly matches the 
				others. Select a replacement tyre of the same brand, size and 
				speed rating. <br>
				<br>
				In most cases you will need to change tyres because they have 
				worn out. In such situations, if two of your tyres have a lot of 
				remaining tread depth, but you need to replace the other two, 
				you should replace them with a pair of tyres that come as close 
				as possible to matching your existing tyres. While identical new 
				tyres are desirable, others of the same size and type can also 
				provide good results. Only consider selecting new tyres that are 
				from the same tyre category as your existing tyres. Also, new 
				tyres should be installed on the rear axle.<br>
				<br>
				If one pair of tyres have worn faster than the others, it is 
				advisable to ask your mechanic why this has occurred. Was it 
				caused by a lack of tyre rotation, out-of-spec wheel alignment 
				or loose mechanical parts? Once the problem has been found, it 
				can be corrected before it damages your new set. Keep in mind 
				that your ultimate goal is that all of your tyres always wear 
				out at the same time so they can be replaced as a set. If all of 
				your tyres are wearing out together, you have the greatest 
				flexibility in tyre selection. If you were happy with the 
				original tyres, simply replace them. If you want longer 
				treadwear, a smoother ride or more handling, there are probably 
				tyres that will help you accomplish that. A little bit of online 
				research will go a long way in helping you decide on just the 
				right tyre to suit your needs.<br>
				<br>

							<img border="0" src="images/RE11.gif" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="90" height="116" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Choosing 
				the size<br>
				</b>When you have finally decided on the tyre that you want 
				fitted to your vehicle, the next most important ting is choosing 
				the correct size. A tyre’s first requirement is that it must be 
				able to carry the weight of your vehicle. No matter how good a 
				tyre you select, if its capabilities are “overworked” just 
				carrying the load, it will have little reserve capacity to help 
				your vehicle respond quickly in an emergency. So when you are in 
				the selection process, make certain that your new tyre’s size is 
				designed to carry the weight of your vehicle! Don’t undersize.<br>
				<br>
				The other size consideration is overall tyre diameter. Since 
				many of the functions of today’s vehicles are highly 
				computerized, maintaining accurate speed data going into the 
				computer assures accurate instructions coming out. And an 
				important part of the speed equation is your tyre’s overall tyre 
				diameter. For cars and vans, staying within a three per cent 
				diameter change is desirable. Pick-ups and sport utility 
				vehicles (SUVs) are usually engineered to handle up to a 15 per 
				cent oversize tyre.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Analysing driving conditions<br>
				</b>The next important step is analysing the conditions that you 
				will be using the vehicle in be it sunshine, rain or snow, 
				though the latter is not something that we can consider here in 
				Oman but should prove useful if you plan on heading to a country 
				where it is relevant. This analysis should be taken a step 
				further when deciding on tyres for SUV’s, especially if you plan 
				on taking your vehicle off-road. <br>
				<br>
				If you live in an area where you face an extreme change in 
				weather it is advisable to have more than one set of tyres and 
				wheels (for example, summer tyres in summer and snow tyres in 
				winter). This also allows you to quite easily select tyres that 
				exactly meet your diverse needs. On the other hand if you decide 
				to use one set of tyres for every season, you may get good 
				performance under many conditions, but your vehicle’s 
				performance will be compromised when the conditions are at their 
				worst. <br>
				<br>
				When it comes to SUVs that you will be taking off road, the 
				important thing to do is to select your tyres so that they match 
				the typical off-road driving conditions you expect to encounter. 
				It is advisable to check with your local tyre dealership for the 
				best tyres to suit your conditions or even a little bit of 
				online research will go a long way in making the right choice.<br>
				<br>
				On the other hand, if you only drive around your neighborhood 
				almost any tyre will do. But if you drive your vehicle on 
				congested city streets and expressways during rush hour you will 
				be better served by more responsive tyres. If you drive 
				extensively on high ways and consistently travel long distances, 
				you will want quiet, smooth riding, long wearing tyres. Or if 
				you like to drive quickly on twisting roads or through the 
				mountains you will want good handling tyres. And if you drive on 
				the track or in autocross events, you will want the best 
				competition tyres available. So in conclusion, if your worst 
				driving conditions and your typical conditions are similar, one 
				set of tyres will be all you need. If you live at the edge of 
				the snowbelt and infrequently get snow you may want to select an 
				all-season tyre. If your SUV is used as the family’s station 
				wagon and driven on the road all of the time, overly aggressive 
				light truck tyres aren’t for you. <br>
				<br>
				If your worst driving condition occurs frequently and is 
				dissimilar to your typical driving condition, you may want to 
				consider selecting two sets of tyres for your vehicle. Each set 
				will be designed to master the specific conditions without 
				compromising your driving satisfaction at the extremes. While 
				purchasing two sets of tyres may appear expensive, the set 
				you’re not using won’t wear while you are using the other set, 
				and combined they’ll provide longer total wear than either set 
				could individually.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Balancing value to price<br>
				</b>And finally, the most important consideration that you will 
				have to make is deciding on a tyre that fits your budget. Buying 
				good tyres is never cheap and sometimes when yo</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">u 
				are selecting new tyres and find one that is perfect, although 
				more expensive than another tyre that appears to be a close 
				second, what can you do? The answer is quite simple – consider 
				evaluating your situation by comparing ‘how much per km’ each 
				tyre will cost. If you plan to drive your vehicle another 40,000 
				kms and are considering the ‘perfect’ tyres at 50 rials each, 
				and the other at 45 rials each; you may be surprised to find out 
				that the cost of the ‘perfect’ set costs just 1.25 baisas per km 
				while the close set costs 1.13 baisas per km. so the question 
				you will have to answer is “will saving the 20 rials today make 
				up for not having selected the perfect tyre’ that you will be 
				driving on for the next two years?</font><div align="center">

									<font face="Verdana" size="1">With summer 
									round the corner, it is advisable to be 
									pro-active and check the condition of your 
									tyres, lest it gets too late and you’re left 
									stranded on the road with a burst tyre. 
									Before we get down to the nitty gritties, 
									lets understand what the sidewall markings 
									on tyres denote.<br>
									Side wall markings on a tyre<br>
									<br>
									P215/65R15 89H<br>
									P: A tyre meant for Passenger Cars <br>
									215: Nominal width of tyre, in this case 
									215mm<br>
									65: Aspect ratio = 65% of 215 = 139.75mm is 
									the side wall height<br>
									R: Implies this is a radial tyre, 15: Rim

									89: Load Index, which corresponds to 580kg 
									is the load bearing capacity<br>
									H: Speed rating, corresponds to a max speed

									<br>
									<b>Tyre maintenance<br>
									</b>Any tyre, no matter how well 
									constructed, may fail in use as a result of 
									punctures, impact damage, improper inflation 
									or other conditions resulting from use. Tyre 
									failures may result in damage to the vehicle 
									or personal injury. To minimise the risk of 
									tyre failure, we strongly recommend the 
									following:<br>
									<br>
									Inflation pressure – Tyre pressure including 
									the spare, should be checked at least once a 
									month before driving, when the tyres are 
									cold. Maintaining the recommended tyre 
									pressure provides proper sidewall deflection 
									and safe operating temperatures for the 
									tyres. It is also very important to tyre 
									life, safety and vehicle handling. Under 
									inflation creates excessive heat; lower load 
									carrying capacity and can seriously reduce 
									tyre life. Irregular wear can also be caused 
									by under or over inflation. Use dust caps on 
									valves to maintain an airtight seal while 
									keeping dust and moisture out.<br>
									<br>
									Tyre rotation for passenger cars - The 
									purpose of rotating tyres is to achieve a 
									more uniform tyre wear for all tyres on a 
									vehicle. Before rotating tyres, determine 
									the cause of any unusual wear and correct 
									any mis-alignment, imbalance or other 
									mechanical problems. First rotation should 
									be done after the 5,000 to 7,500 km and 
									every subsequent rotation, after every 
									10,000 km. Do not mix radials and bias ply 
									tyres on the same axle. Temporary spare 
									tyres cannot be rotated as shown above. Do 
									not mix or rotate different speed rated 
									tyres.<br>
									<br>
									Wheel alignment and balancing – These are 
									very important considerations for deriving 
									safety and maximum mileage from your tyres, 
									Check how your tyres are wearing out at 
									least once a month. If your tyres are 
									wearing out unevenly, such as the inside 
									shoulder is wearing out faster than the rest 
									of the tread, your car may be out of 
									alignment. This condition not only reduces 
									the life of your tyre but also adversely 
									affects the handling characteristics of your 
									car, which could be dangerous. An imbalanced 
									tyre and rim assembly may also be a cause of 
									vibration at certain speeds. Prolonged use 
									of the tyres in such a condition can lead to 
									tyre damage.<br>
									<br>
									Tyre Replacement - There are Tread Wear 
									Indicators (TWI) on the sidewall of your 
									tyre. These indicators are at a depth of 
									1.6mm. When the tread of your tyre gets worn 
									out due to use and comes down to the level 
									of these indicators, it is an indication to 
									replace your tyre. When your tyre gets 
									damaged due to side wall cuts, tread cuts, 
									damaged beads etc, it is again time to 
									replace the tyre. When replacing your tyres, 
									it is best advised to stick to the 
									specifications as laid down by the car 
									manufacturer. Filling your tyres with 
									nitrogen would be a good idea as this will 
									keep your tyres cool and at the same time 
									keep the air pressure constant for months 
									together.<br>
									Feel free to drop into any of our Tyre 
									service centres, to have your tyres checked.</font></td>

				<br>
				The Jinzi Multifunction Electric Car Tyre Change Kit was 
				designed with three key factors in mind; simple, safe, easy to

				<br>
				<b>Tyre safety tips</b><br>
				Never fit used tyres and change your existing tyres if they are 
				very old. Cracks in the tread or in the sidewall rubber, 
				sometimes accompanied by deformation of the carcass, are a sure 
				sign of aging. Have your old tyres checked by a tyre specialist 
				so that you can be certain they are still suitable for further 
				use.<br>
				<br>
				Do not use tyres with a tread depth of less than 1.6mm. Apart 
				from being illegal, tyres with low levels of tread will slide 
				easily, suffer from extended braking distances and will be more 
				susceptible to rupturing. In wet conditions the vehicle will 
				aquaplane making braking and handling almost impossible.<br>
				<br>
				Make sure your air pressures are correct. Low air pressure 
				generates heat which can result in the rubber and cord 
				separating, which in turn leads to the cord becoming cut and 
				puncturing the tyre. Low pressure also results in excessive wear 
				on the edge of the tyre, shortening the tyre’s life. Excessive 
				pressure, meanwhile, results in unpredictable handling in 
				addition to which, if the tyre suffers an impact, it’s easily 
				ruptured and cut. If you brake hard, the tyre may skid, which 
				reduces tyre life as the centre of the tread becomes worn. Check 
				tyre inflation pressures at least twice a month. Always check 
				pressures when tyres are cool and maintain the pressure 
				recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.<br>
				<br>
				Don’t drive with damaged tyres. If you drive with materials such 
				as stone in the tread groove, or with a nail stuck in the tyre, 
				the tyre can become punctured or ruptured. You should change the 
				tyre immediately on discovering any damage to avoid any further 
				damage to the carcass.<br>
				Treat abnormal tyre wear immediately. To assure normal wear you 
				should check air pressures and alignment and rotate the tyres 
				regularly. In addition you should avoid bad driving habits such 
				as sudden acceleration, braking and cornering.<br>
				<br>
				Check the spare tyre. Make sure you regularly check the spare 
				tyre’s air pressure, existence/non existence of damage and the 
				depth of remaining groove regularly.<br>
				<br>
				Never mount radial tyres on the same axle as non-radial tyres or 
				radial tyres on the front axle when non-radial tyres are mounted 
				on the rear axle. These conditions are likely to cause vehicle 
				instability resulting in a sudden loss of control and serious 
				injury.<br>
				<br>
				Check regularly that wheel nuts are securely tightened.<br>
				<br>
				Never overload your tyres. The maximum load and inflation 
				pressure of the tyres are moulded into the sidewall. Also, 
				remember; the tyre is capable of carrying the maximum load only 
				if it is inflated to its maximum air pressure.<br>
				<br>
				Do not use detergents or chemicals containing petroleum products 
				for cleaning or polishing your tyres.<br>
				<br>
				Avoid prolonged use on bad surfaces.<br>
				<br>
				If you get a puncture, stop as soon as possible and change the 
				tyre. Besides the obvious safety considerations, continuing to 
				drive on an under-inflated tyre can cause structural 
				deterioration. Punctured tyres must always be removed from the 
				wheel to check for secondary damage<br>
				<br>
				If it is necessary and feasible to repair a tyre, it must be 
				carried out by a tyre specialist as soon as possible to avoid 
				any structural deterioration. All tyre repairs must be entrusted 
				to a tyre repair specialist .<br>

                    The year was 1962 and I was working in the army at that 
					time. There were few cars those days and so any vehicle that 
					went to Bait al Falaj, the army headquarters would bring 
					mail from there, urgent things would obviously come via 
					signal. The truck would leave very early and take two to 
					three hours to get to Bait al Falaj from Ghala (where our 
					regiment was posted) and the truck would invariably come 
					back just when we were about to close our offices.<br>
					<br>
					I remember once we had just closed our office and the truck 
					came with the day’s mail and other provisions. I had already 
					gone around 50 yards from the office and the commanding 
					officer Jim Sheridon shouted at me saying, sergeant come 
					back, the mail has come. I came back and reasoned with him 
					that since we had closed our office could we open the mail 
					the next day and he said no. I was very angry and upset, and 
					went to the truck moaning and groaning, but since it was an 
					order, I did what I was asked to do. It took about an hour 
					and a half to do the needful. When I finished Sheridon saw 
					anger writ all over my face, he put his arms around my 
					shoulder and said, “I saw that you were angry and not 
					willing to come back, but you came back because you were 
					ordered to. Listen to my fatherly advice Maqbool never leave 
					today’s work for tomorrow.” And from that day I have adopted 
					that policy. For example, I never leave office before 
					replying to all my mails and this has helped me immensely in 
					life. In a nutshell it helps one to gain time.<br>

                    <br>
                    Some years ago, I read an interesting book titled “<b>What 
					they don’t teach you at Harvard Business School</b>” by Mark 
					H McCormack. As the title was provocative and teasing, I 
					bought the book and read it thoroughly. After reading the 
					book, I came to the conclusion that it is better if it is 
					done our way that is the “Jawad Sultan” way of doing 
					business. It has a local flavour and also takes into account 
					our beliefs, tradition and ethos. When I say this, I do not 
					mean to sound pompous since, ours is a family business and 
					as they say “it is best if it is done our way.”<br>
					<br>
					The biggest influence in my life has been my father, Jawad A 
					Sultan who is also our group chairman. His influence on me 
					is very profound as I have watched him in action for over 25 
					years. “Avoid the riff raff and keep it simple” has always 
					been his success formula. <br>
					<br>
					Our group motto is to stay liquid at all times and also 
					embark on the projects only when we have the complete 
					resources for the new project or at least a major portion of 
					it, so that part requirements of cash can be met, as per the 
					need of the project. This is something against conventional 
					wisdom since most management gurus will advocate appropriate 
					leveraging for a given project. But, thankfully this has 
					worked for us.<br>

                    Best advice was an Arabic phrase which translates into: “Had 
					it lasted for others, it would not have reached you.” I was 
					complaining to my father when I was around 14 when we had to 
					move from one country to another regularly and he mentioned 
					it to remind me that change is inevitable and necessary part 
					of life. However, it also provides hope for the future. I 
					try to remind myself of it as a succinct mantra to ensure 
					that I keep my ego in check. It also serves another purpose 
					of ensuring that I keep a cordial relationship with everyone 
					since the balance of power changes constantly.<br>
					<br>
					I have been in several situations in my professional life 
					where I have become the boss of my colleagues or where one 
					of my colleagues is promoted to lead our team. In both 
					situations, because of the manner in which I have conducted 
					myself, I have been able to deal with the situation 
					professionally and with no resentment or awkwardness. <br>
					<br>
					It also stands true for companies where the status and 
					standing of companies can vary dramatically or suddenly, 
					giving you a chance to dislodge the incumbents from the top 
					positions to place your own organisation there or if you are 
					at the top to avoid slipping into complacency since the tide 
					could change.<br>

                    <br>
                    In the early stages of my life, the best advice I got in 
					life is from my parents. They impressed upon me that 
					education is the best tool to achieve personal goals and 
					hard work is the best way to fulfill my obligations towards 
					myself and society. This sounds basic but such advice is 
					crucial in many societies, especially rural societies.<br>
					<br>
					I tried my best to get a good education that my parents 
					talked about. I forged a career in telecommunications. I 
					broadened the meaning of “getting good education and working 
					hard”, and learned more through life and my career. I have 
					also embraced a principle of sharing knowledge or experience 
					with my colleagues at work or friends in society. This has 
					helped me to be seen as a generous and contributing 
					colleague – and somehow this helped me progress in my 
					career.<br>
					<br>
					I have always tried to lead by example. I worked hard, but 
					more importantly I learned from my colleagues and shared my 
					knowledge with them. I always tried to coach and mentor 
					junior employees with potential. This has given me enormous 
					job satisfaction, and it was seen by the senior management 
					as a very positive attribute. This helped me to further 
					develop myself as a leader and enhanced my own career and 
					hopefully the careers of some of my colleagues.</font><hr width="98%" size="1">

                    <br>
                    Throughout my life I have been inspired by my family, 
					friends, colleagues and competition. Learning is a never 
					ending process in one’s life and one can learn different 
					virtues from different people. For this reason, I have 
					embraced many role models and many mentors, both in my 
					career as well as in my personal life. All great advices 
					have not only been from older and wiser heads but also from 
					young and inspirational executives who have years of 
					experience and feel for the market. To me, books are another 
					important source of inspiration and insights on business 
					challenges and opportunities. I have also been immensely 
					benefited by attending executive management programmes. I do 
					believe that my principles and approaches to career and life 
					have been influenced to a great extent by many sound advices 
					which I have received from many sources. Some of these 
					principles that have guided me over the years and more so 
					during the crisis period are:<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr"> 
                    &nbsp;<br>
					Every crisis is an opportunity. Today’s challenge is 
					tomorrow’s opportunity and you always come out stronger out 
					of adverse situations. When you see an opportunity, take a 
					stand, take risks and assume full responsibility. <br>
					Asking for help is not a sign of weakness but rather the 
					action required to achieve a goal.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
					Always be prepared to take the big chance when it comes 
					along but before you act do your own due diligence 
					systematically and meticulously. Business decisions are all 
					about future results; it is certainly not about the past and 
					very little about today. To be successful, one must have a 
					feel for the markets (knowing when things are changing and 
					when public opinion is starting to change). I look at my 
					role in conversion of a single product mortgage financing 
					bank (Alliance Housing Bank) to a full fledged commercial 
					bank (Ahli Bank) in this context. A right step at the right 
					time.<br>
					Finally, never forget the “Big Picture” while taking 
					decisions, whether in career or in life.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                  	Accept responsibilities with courage</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    The two pieces of advice I most remember were given at the 
					beginning of my adult life and some years later as I climbed 
					the corporate ladder. As a young adult, my father’s advice 
					was: “Do not demand your rights, rather accept your 
					responsibilities with courage and purpose.” Heavy words for 
					a young person, but they did instill in me a sense of 
					service and a willingness to accept challenges not for 
					myself but for others. They were also wise words as, like 
					many young men at the start of adulthood, I was in need of 
					guidance on how to channel my passion for causes and 
					impatience to right the world’s wrongs. My father’s advice 
					helped me focus in my early life on learning and 
					understanding, thinking deeply about challenges, identifying 
					solutions and on how to persuade others to support me in 
					their implementation. I also learned the value of mistakes 
					and how essential it is to take responsibility for these, 
					too – and not to blame others!<br>
					<br>
					Years later I received timely advice from a Shell colleague 
					on the transition from management to leadership: “Management 
					is about resolving problems, leadership is about providing 
					others with the space and courage to resolve problems.” In 
					this transition the most difficult instinct to bring under 
					control was my appetite for identifying and championing 
					solutions to increasingly complex problems. I learned the 
					importance of corporate values, of listening with respect 
					and of supporting others find creative and effective 
					solutions in their areas of management responsibility. I 
					also learned that these solutions were invariably more 
					successful through ownership than any solution I might have 
					proposed on my own.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    The best advice I have had was in 1983 from an ex-military 
					friend of my father from Wales who, when asked if it would 
					be sensible for me to go to Oman for my first job, post-qualification.He 
					said: “Well I spent a number of years working as a doctor in 
					Saudi Arabia in the 1960s. It was a tad hot but generally a 
					helpful experience and Oman is close, and similar to Saudi 
					so I advise you to go.” Clearly he had never been to Oman 
					(it’s more than a “tad” hot) but I followed his advice and

					came from a friend who advised me to marry my wife, Samiya,

                    <br>
                    Keep an open mind. There are many sides to a story,’ I was 
					given this advice ages ago by Sister Mary Frances Delaney, 
					my O Levels English teacher. The advice was administered in 
					the context of an essay where I failed to recognise the 
					utterly biased viewpoint of the writer and jumped to a 
					narrow and premature conclusion. The expected ridicule from 
					my loving classmates ensured that her words left an 
					indelible mark on my memory! <br>
					<br>
					Trying always to keep an open mind has helped me both in my 
					personal and business life. It has taught me to be 
					inquisitive, analytical, reflective, and patient before 
					reaching conclusions. I however, still have to continue 
					reminding myself that even that particular conclusion is 
					subject to change should new facts and information emerge. 
					This is the hard part and I am not sure how well I 
					succeed... <br>
					<br>
					In other ways, the advice has helped me not to react to 
					seemingly shocking news or opinions. I try and wait to get 
					the full picture before freaking out – just kidding! Being a 
					bit of a globe-trotter, the advice has also helped enrich my 
					understanding and appreciation of the customs and cultures 
					of the societies I have had the privilege to live in.<br>
					<br>
					Finally, and very importantly, I feel the advice helps me 
					take my time before I make judgements about people 
					irrespective of the opinions of others. At work especially, 
					when I take on a new role, my approach is to keep an open 
					mind towards my new team and give them a fair chance to 
					succeed before making any drastic changes. This approach 
					flies in the face of some macho ‘shoot first ask questions 
					later’ management theories but, honestly, I would rather 
					listen to Sister Delaney!<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    The simple advice that has influenced my way of doing things 
					in my personal and professional life came from my mother. A 
					calm voice of reason to an angry little girl all set to do 
					battle on a now trivial, but then all-consuming issue. ‘What 
					if you were on the other side?’ she asked, making me trade 
					places and in so doing, understand a diametrically opposite 
					perspective. In my professional life, this has been 
					invaluable advice that I follow and pass on. All too often, 
					we are quick to cry foul over a client injustice, but feel 
					perfectly justified in doing the same to our suppliers. Love 
					a pat on the back ourselves but withhold expressing 
					appreciation. It is so easy to fire off an angry e-mail 
					decimating someone, unmindful of the irreversible 
					destruction our words can cause. Pausing to imagine I am the 
					recipient instead of the sender almost always makes me hit 
					the ‘delete’ key. It holds me back from ever using harsh 
					words with subordinates because I know just how crushed I 
					would feel were I at the receiving end. In day to day work, 
					trading places helps me streamline client presentations by 
					anticipating objections. In my personal life too, this 
					advice has taught me not to say things I wouldn’t like said 
					to me. It has helped my anger management, to the extent that 
					today not many even know I have a volatile temper! There 
					isn’t a moment in life when this simple advice isn’t 
					applicable. I recognise that even if I occasionally fail to 
					follow it.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    Firstly, in fact. I am brought up in very religious, 
					faithful and moderate family in Muttrah. My late mother was 
					very particular about being disciplined – she was always 
					ensuring that we pray on time, attend school regularly, help 
					people and be patient. My mother was always very specific. 
					She insisted that we spoke the truth and did not take 
					anything without permission even if we were starving or 
					desperate for help. Secondly, this disciplined upbringing 
					has helped me in my career. For instance, attending school 
					on time, helped me to value the importance of time 
					management in my career. Even now If I am late for an 
					appointment due to some reason, I always communicate it to 
					the respective party.<br>
					<br>
					Truthfulness has helped me to be transparent and to fulfill 
					my promises and to deliver. Not taking or doing anything 
					without permission has helped me to develop the habit of 
					taking prior approval or permission, consent or getting 
					things ratified from the authorised individual or corporate. 
					If one sits back and looks at management practices followed 
					by corporates i.e. companies article and memorandum of 
					association and corporate governance, one realises that 
					these are basic values of human life which one develops at 
					home first before introducing them in companies.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    Ahappy, well looked-after team is far more productive and 
					creative than an army of slaves – a fairly obvious insight 
					but one that is rarely implemented or given more than 
					lip-service. It was a seminar by the legendary Tom Peters 
					that I attended some years ago that opened my eyes to the 
					true meaning of his statement that the greatest possible 
					resource of any corporation (or person) is a human resource. 
					Nothing else counts, without people-power. Every 
					inspirational company in the world is marked by the 
					outstanding care and concern it lavishes on its human 
					capital. People in organisations like Apple, Google, 
					Infosys, Southwest Airlines are so obviously happy and 
					joyful that they cannot but be highly productive and 
					creative. Such companies are repaid for their people-care 
					many, many times over in the consequent success of their 
					businesses. However, it is clear that people or team 
					orientation has to be genuine, credible and go beyond 
					motherhood statements in corporate presentations. If a team 
					works well together and enjoys doing what it does, it is 
					clearly visible to customers. Exploited slaves, on the other 
					hand, just await an opportunity to escape, and cannot be 
					expected to deliver quality or commitment. Treating people 
					with care and courtesy pays off even in one’s personal life 
					– it’s a remarkably small world after all ! A prime example 
					of a people-caring organisation locally is Muscat Hills, 
					whose stated credo, framed on its walls, clearly lays down 
					that its people come first. Bravo!<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    The best dvice which I have ever got is from my father 
					Pathmudi Shashikanth Rao. He retired as regional sales 
					manager with Godrej &amp; Boyce Mfrg Co Ltd and continues to 
					have an active mind and involvement/influence in my 
					progress. His advice has been really very simple: “Do your 
					duty assigned to you to the best of your abilities, believe 
					in yourself, remain humble and trust in God…your efforts 
					will certainly be recognised or rewarded in due course”. 
					This simple tenet is heard so often from so many other 
					quarters as well, but frankly some or most people find it 
					quite difficult to put this in practice in their daily work 
					and life. I try my best to adopt this in my daily 
					interactions with my family, friends and 
					colleagues/sub-ordinates. It does not matter if I am 
					fallible and fail once or few times…what is important and 
					matters most is how I can get up the next day and try to 
					follow the principle that day, every day being a new day!<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    Ten years ago, I attended a conference where the speaker 
					concluded his session by asking the participants to reflect 
					on what is meant by the 19th century saying “less is more.” 
					From that day on wards, the phrase stayed with me and I 
					considered it as my own personal mantra. It was the notion 
					that through simplicity and clarity one can get more 
					accomplished in less time, with less effort, and with 
					infinite opportunities that captivated my attention. This 
					has assisted me tremendously in my career and I have tried 
					to execute the idea of this profound saying through our day 
					to day work at renna, where our main focus is on the little 
					things that matter the most to our customers.<br>
					<br>
					renna’s mission revolves around simplicity, 
					straightforwardness and transparency, enriching our 
					customers lives through ‘sharing the moment’. Offers such as 
					free credit, free customer care and early off peak hours 
					with no fine print, are all the little and simple promotions 
					that can go a long way to solidify customer satisfaction and 
					loyalty. Here less is definitely more.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    The best advice i ever got must be the guidance that I 
					received from my then regional boss, Mike Rake, who went on 
					to become the global chairman of KPMG International. Whilst 
					it relates to life in general, and I imagine has been 
					relevant since time began, it is particularly relevant in 
					today’s electronic modern age. It boils down to the old 
					adage: “Think before you act” and, to bring it up to date in 
					terms of modern technology: “Think before you press the send 
					button on the BlackBerry”.<br>
					<br>
					It is only too common in today’s world for people to expect 
					professional advice by “return email”. I think that it is 
					particularly important when one is under stress or is 
					inclined to react emotionally to a given set of 
					circumstances, then one must reflect as to whether one’s 
					initial impulse and gut reaction is the most appropriate 
					response. All too often the “reply” one would send following 
					the receipt of an email that causes an emotional reaction 
					proves to be very different in the event one “sleeps on it”. 
					I would suggest that in 90 per cent of the time, one would 
					heavily edit the initial response after a good night’s 
					sleep. I think that not only is this an excellent advice in 
					terms of one’s professional life, but in one’s personal life 
					too – particularly when you have two teenage children! <br>
					<br>
					So whilst this advice appropriately relates to the modern 
					world of BlackBerries, it has been applicable since the 
					beginning of time. Indeed the concept of “Seeking the facts 
					before providing insight” underpins one of KPMG’s Global 
					core values. I believe that following this advice has 
					enabled me to avoid many potentially embarrassing and costly 
					situations and, accordingly, I shall be forever grateful to 
					Mike Rake for his casual comment which I remember to this 
					day.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    Inspirations/advices are very important tools of success in 
					personal and professional life. Everyone has a mentor or 
					role model in their life, who motivates them to forge ahead 
					and attain success. A person very close to my heart, my 
					teacher, my guide to all situations, a personality I always 
					look upon at any junction of my life has been my father. He 
					has been the best advisor in my life. His words of wisdom 
					still linger in my heart and have left an impression in my 
					mind. <br>
					<br>
					The best piece of advice he gave me was “Never avoid a 
					problem; face it.” Avoiding problems only delays the pain 
					and agony but facing it at once helps you to work on it 
					faster and better. I advice my colleagues not to have 
					sleepless nights by carrying over problems or by trying to 
					avoid them. I have always focused on my dad’s mantra and his 
					words have helped me face challenges in all areas that I 
					have worked on. As the general manager of OUA, I have often 
					been confronted with issues, which need to be tackled with 
					professionalism. At such times, my father’s advice and his 
					mantra has worked miracles for me.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    Trust your instincts and trust your partners and team mates 
					– this was the advice that I got from my gurus. I have 
					always been instinctive in decision-making both in my career 
					and life. I have never wasted time in glancing back before 
					doing anything and have trusted my partners and my team and 
					that trust has always been justified. My boss at Kirloskar 
					Brothers told me once to test and question all assumptions. 
					I try to dig deep into what I am working on and try to 
					instil the same habit in my colleagues. This is very 
					important in the business environment of today where one 
					does come across a lot of half baked proposals. We follow 
					the practice of team meetings and debriefing so that the 
					entire team knows what is happening and where we are 
					heading. The responsibility and authority levels are clear 
					to all and generally decisions are not interfered with. This 
					has led to the feeling of ownership amongst everyone and 
					eventually we hope to transform this feeling into actual 
					stakeholding. A farewell memento given to me from my team at 
					Kirloskar Brothers reads – take a risk, take a chance, learn 
					to fly, learn to soar. This gave me the added strength to 
					take on certain risks in my career. My parents always told 
					me to give your best and keep working hard, results and 
					success will follow. I have always been known to be a very 
					diligent and hard worker even in the most trying 
					circumstances and more often than not it has paid dividends. 
					My wife tells me to be humble and give credit to the team. I 
					have been working on being humble and encouraging my team

                    The following verse from the Holy Quran was the most 
					influential element on how I conduct my affairs as a 
					manager. Those “who conduct their affairs by mutual 
					consultation (shura)” Quran, (42:38). Furthermore the book 
					of Michael H Hart that ranked the Prophet Muhammad, (peace 
					be upon him) as the most influential person in the history 
					of the world made me eager to know the reason of his choice.
					<br>
					<br>
					Active as a social reformer, diplomat, merchant, 
					philosopher, orator, legislator, and military leader, what 
					kind of leadership style did he use? Will it be still valid 
					today? Those were the questions in my mind that made me 
					embark on a jihad for knowledge on leadership. I then 
					decided to conduct a research on corporate culture and 
					leadership styles in Oman by investigating over 800 
					successful business executives on how they conduct their 
					businesses. To my surprise over 75 per cent of them use 
					leadership style by consultation (Shura). Shura is 
					essentially a parallel to the democratic principle of 
					management style, having analogous aspects and about the 
					same tendency and direction. It is based on three basic 
					precepts. First, that all persons in any given society are 
					equal in human and civil rights. Second, public issues are 
					best decided by the majority and therefore management by 
					consultation ensures inclusion of all concerned. And third, 
					that the three other principles of justice, equality and 
					human dignity, which constitute Islam’s moral core, and from 
					which all Islamic conceptions of human and civil rights is 
					derived, are best realised, in personal as well as public 
					life, under shura governance. This process guarantees 
					inclusion of all involved and reduces the risk of 
					opposition. However the process can be time consuming.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    Over the years I have benefited from a lot of great advice. 
					The best advice my parents ever gave me was to go to 
					college. Considering that I was not keen to pursue my 
					further education and I wanted to drop out, this was not the 
					easiest advice to follow. <br>
					<br>
					And the best career advice I ever received was from my 
					mentor H E Mohammad al Zubair in the summer of 1997. He 
					convinced me to pursue my career in the private sector at a 
					time when I was offered a full time and well paid 
					opportunity with one of the government organisations. I was 
					very unsure about dropping what many Omanis would consider 
					the opportunity of a lifetime and continue my career in the 
					private sector, especially with the majority of the advice I 
					received from family and friends was to take up the 
					government post! But I took the advice of His Excellency and 
					it was a decision I have never regretted. Making that 
					decision has given me the opportunity to meet and work with 
					great-minded people whom I owe so much for sharing their 
					experience and wise advice. <br>
					<br>
					The best business advice was also something my mentor taught 
					me – and that is to do one thing at a time and focus and 
					fight off the temptation to be distracted. This is by far 
					the best advice I have learned and has proven to be highly 
					successful in planning both personal and business 
					objectives, by knowing exactly where you want to go and 
					focusing on it.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                  	Create a solid foundation</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    You must create a solid foundation for the downside risk, at 
					the same time aim to achieve better than the best.” This 
					advice was from my financial management professor at the 
					University of San Diego. I later realised how profound this 
					advice was as I progressed in my career and got into the 
					‘real world’ after my academic education. Though this advice 
					was given in the context of investment and financial 
					management, its application is a must for all aspects of our 
					lives. In business, one must always look at the potential 
					risk of a venture, investment or a project with a far 
					greater scrutiny than looking at the reward. If the rest of 
					the things are taken care of then the reward will always 
					take care of itself.<br>
					<br>
					Investing in the stock markets requires a detailed analysis 
					of how the market can turnaround and head towards an 
					opposite direction and wipe out investors. In the world of 
					business and investments, any financial catastrophe can take 
					place and I do not need to support this with any examples 
					since we are living it right now. Investors with a strong 
					foundation always survive, reward oriented investors vanish. 
					In life, any tragedy can take place, a solid foundation 
					means that no matter what, you will get back on your feet 
					and continue your journey forward. Creating a solid downside 
					foundation is one part of the coin, the other part is aiming 
					to achieve better than the best as this is what will make 
					you have a purpose in life and move on.

                  	Distinguish between ambition and greed</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    The best advice I got when I was still very young was from 
					my father – a medical doctor – and not a businessman. He 
					used to tell me time and again, – “Acquire the ability of 
					distinguishing between ambition and greed,” whenever I would 
					insist on a particular toy or equipment or clothes and try 
					to copy my friend or a neighbour. He was very patient while 
					giving reasons – never stopping me from dreaming or in any 
					manner affecting my dream. He used to say, “ambition is what 
					is achievable with your means, balance is all greed.”<br>
					<br>
					Till I was 30, I never understood its relevance in life or I 
					rather thought my father was trying to give me a lecture as 
					his own personal economy had limitations. I learnt it the 
					hard way. The Indian Company viz Voltas (TATA Group) for 
					which I was working till 1977 before coming to Oman came out 
					with an instalment scheme for window air conditioners for 
					its employees. I thought “great – I can afford to pay the 
					instalment while I sleep in comfort.” Within three months my 
					wife started complaining that my salary finished by the 20th 
					of every month! I had not calculated, foolishly or due to 
					blindness created by my greed, that I had to pay electricity 
					bills to afford the comfort! I had to sell off the air 
					conditioner owing to the electricity bills. I had entered 
					greed zone! The border line between ‘ambition’ and crossing 
					into greed zone varies from person to person, family to 
					family, company to company and even country to country. The 
					advice has helped me immensely in my personal life, family 
					life and in leading the company. <br>
					<br>
					Every individual gets a message – if he or she is prepared 
					to listen to the inner voice or feeling or what some call 
					the sixth sense or the third eye – as and when one is 
					entering the greed zone. Applying this principle all-round, 
					our company has grown from a mere 14 people to 10,000 plus – 
					with unparalleled diversification in 33 years – always 
					improving our performance. According to me Oman is following 
					this principle in implementing its own ambitions for the 
					country without copying anyone or entering into greed zone.
					<br>
					<br>
					My father is 92 years old and still serving his patients 
					every day. He does not run the air conditioner I provided 
					for his bedroom in Delhi – we can afford it economically, 
					but he says he shall remain healthy without one! That gave 
					me another example, that ‘ambition and greed’ principle can 
					be applied outside of economic examples. ‘Health is wealth’ 
					and he never entered greed zone to destroy his health!<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    The best advice that I ever received was from my father, T K 
					Oommen, an accomplished sociologist, who told me during my 
					early days of schooling: “Feel free to choose what you want 
					to do in life, but excel at it. And for this, you must love 
					what you do.” He is himself a fine example of this, given 
					that he emerged from an extremely modest background to scale 
					enormous heights in his profession, so much so that not only 
					has he been awarded numerous times for excellence in the 
					field of social sciences, but also received one of the 
					highest honours from the government of India, the Padma 
					Bhushan in 2008 for his contribution in the field of 
					education. <br>
					<br>
					Even though I was unable to appreciate the full import of 
					his words at the time, today I truly believe that to have 
					obtained at a young age the distilled wisdom that only age 
					and experience can give you, was a truly wonderful gift. The 
					truth, though, is that I did not heed his advice initially, 
					as is illustrated by the fact that I chose to dabble in 
					various professions (journalism, advertising, entertainment, 
					etc.) before settling down in the automobile business (where 
					I have been only for a little over a decade). This piece of 
					advice has taught me to really differentiate between what 
					one loves to do as opposed to taking up what might be in 
					vogue or succumbing to peer pressure, more remuneration, and 
					so on. In my present role, my endeavour has been to place 
					the “right” people in the right job not just because of 
					their skill set, but to also understand what drives them and 
					how enthusiastic they are in doing that job, so that today I 
					believe we have a team that is mostly comprised of people 
					who love doing what they do.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    Advices are available for free but only valuable advice 
					makes a difference in life. I should refer to two very 
					important advices in received in my life. One is from my 
					father and the other is from my wife. My father, late 
					Kasiviswanathan, was a businessman and had several decades 
					of experience in a variety of businesses. I have 
					participated in his business and have had occasions to be 
					with him and learn from his experience. His outstanding 
					advice to me was – in business you should learn to control 
					the purchase price and expenses. If we can control and 
					reduce these two we can be successful in business as the 
					rest is not controllable by us. In today’s market scenario 
					it is the customer who controls the selling price. With 
					stiff competition around we will never get to enjoy a decent 
					margin and this situation is used by customers. Hence if we 
					need to succeed in business and keep our heads above water, 
					a control on purchase price and expenses is mandatory. This 
					will determine the success or fall of an enterprise. This 
					advice has come in handy and I have managed to increase 
					bottomline with this principle. My wife J Suganthi is a 
					social worker and she advices me to treat others as I would 
					like them to treat me. This is very valid. Sometimes before 
					I react or respond to a situation I imagine for a while on 
					the planned response as if the other person is responding to 
					me. Such a thought has helped me balance my actions and be a 
					successful person. I am a socially active person and this 
					advice has helped me win many well wishers in both my 
					professional and personal life. This allows me to empathise 
					in a situation and take an objective view of the 
					circumstance. If we respond without giving a thought to the 
					after effects, it could be sometimes suicidal. This 
					proactive thought helps avoid such conditions and creates 
					satisfying situations.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

					of the board and founder of the IBM company said. This was 
					the first of the five key principles given to me as a young 
					IBMer when I first joined IBM as a trainee in Princeton (NJ) 
					in 1969. Every IBMer has to know it by heart. At the 
					beginning I found the advice a little pompous but quickly 
					realised that it would be an important one in my life and 
					through which I would benchmark my own progress and my own 
					achievements, whether these would be in the professional or 
					personal domains. <br>
					<br>
					I have been an IBMer for over 40 years and although the 
					company has changed, our pursuit of excellence has not. In 
					my professional life, I have tried to share the value of 
					excellence at every level. When you give advice, you have to 
					live by your advice. And this is not always easy. <br>
					<br>
					This means sharing and coaching with the team an enthusiasm 
					to excel and pay attention to detail, from lowest to the 
					highest skilled employee in the company. Anyone who abides 
					by this advice will soon give it to others and its benefits 
					spread out to everyone. It is a culture which keeps me and 
					our team focussed on what, I believe, should be the pillar 
					of our business relationships i.e. develop a long term 
					partnership and loyalty with our customers. Pursuing 
					excellence sets clear goals which are simple to remember and 
					keeps you permanently alert at everything you do. However, 
					it would not be truthful to say that this advice is a simple 
					one to follow and achieve as it does require significant 
					patience and perseverance. <br>
					<br>
					On the personal front, I am a demanding person and always 
					enjoy a challenge. Pursuit of excellence has developed a 
					sense of quality which I seek when setting up personal 
					projects or sharing my views with my family. I have a 
					fantastic wife, three great kids and a bunch of nice friends 
					so I suppose following this advice must have helped me in my 
					personal life somewhat. GBM has been in Oman for 20 years 
					building up on this advice and applying its principles at 
					every opportunity. For example, our projects are submitted 
					to quality assurance reviews where each member of the team 
					has to comply to the highest solution design, resource plans 
					and deliverables possible before the project can start. We 
					found out long ago that projects driven by excellence are 
					the ones that are likely to succeed best. <br>
					<br>
					To belong to a worldwide IBM network helps as collaboration 
					on excellence keeps the good ideas coming. The bottom line 
					is whether it is at an international level or in Oman, we 
					must constantly improve the way we work and translate this 
					excellence into a tangible value to our customers. Education 
					plays a key role and so does our methodology. Every project 
					is an opportunity to share them with our clients and ensure 
					that excellence has a pervasive effect throughout. <br>
					<br>
					I found over time that pursuit of excellence is never an 
					easy advice to follow. It is a way of life. There are no 
					short cuts but doing something well is the most gratifying 
					feeling. Thanks for the advice Mr Watson!<br>

                    Ihave been blessed to be surrounded by people that offer 
					relative and valuable advice throughout my life. Whether 
					it’s in my childhood, school, college or during my career. I 
					can’t think of one single advice being the best. As all of 
					them in some way have made me the way I am today. However, 
					the most recent advice that I have received was from my 
					mentor. Allow me first to say that my view of an advice is a 
					message intended to make positive change to the recipient. 
					It has to be honest, relevant and timely. One can’t really 
					sum up the advice that I have received in a single line, 
					simply because it could be interpreted as being very 
					general. Nevertheless, this is what he told me “Understand 
					your motives and choose a career path that is aligned with 
					your motives.” He requested me to read a book titled Why Did 
					I Do That? by George New and David Cormack. I believe that 
					understanding your own motives is very important. Not 
					everyone is going to be a millionaire, neither a leader. 
					Some of us may choose to be social leaders. It all boils 
					down to what is it that keeps us interested. I have not 
					finished reading the book, but I am sure when I do that I 
					will have a better understanding of my personal motives and 
					that would play a role in my next career choice.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                  	Use money judiciously</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    Use money well, but do not waste it. Be frugal but not 
					stingy. Money is there to do good things,” this is a lesson 
					that my father has instilled in me. Time and time again and 
					in every way possible one should strive to save money. This 
					has helped me understand life more and respect money.<br>
					<br>
					Ever since I was a young boy wanting to buy childish toys, 
					that I called needs and necessities; this is what my father 
					kept repeating to me. Now I understand the meaning of it 
					all. Unlike our fathers and grandfathers, we have been 
					blessed to live life to the fullest with everything being 
					within our reach. This makes us take things for granted and 
					that is why the new generation does not value money. Since I 
					graduated from university, I have been tasked with a lot of 
					responsibilities in our family business, and I have learnt 
					that hard earned money is not easy to spend ruthlessly.<br>
					<br>
					One of the main tasks that I was handed over, was to make 
					our businesses run more efficiently, bringing down costs and 
					raising margins to make greater profits. In my personal 
					life, I have learnt to appreciate the good things in life 
					and to make greater good of money. Finally I would like to 
					add a piece of humble advice which I greatly believe in: 
					“Find work in something you love and it won’t feel like 
					work.”<br>

                    <br>
                    I am always grateful to receive advice from customers, 
					colleagues and family members, although I would hasten to 
					add, not all at once!<br>
					<br>
					Nawras has always encouraged feedback and that often leads 
					us to receiving advice from our customers which I assure you 
					we sincerely welcome. Within the Nawras family we are all 
					living the customer experience so that we can deliver the 
					products and pleasingly different services that our 
					customers really want. If customers feel that we could do 
					something in a better way, I am delighted to say they don’t 
					hesitate to tell us, giving us their advice either through 
					our people in a Nawras Store or by talking to our customer 
					champions or via the website. We care for customers which is 
					why we invite this dialogue and act on the valuable 
					information we receive.<br>
&nbsp;<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr"> 
                    In the past I have also been fortunate enough to receive 
					some fabulous advice from Sir Richard Branson when we worked 
					together in Hong Kong. The first question Branson would 
					always ask me when I was explaining our plans was “that 
					sounds great but what is the customer experience?” This 
					resonated with me and so now whenever I am sitting with our 
					Nawras family that’s my first question too! He also showed 
					me and everyone around him how much fun business really is 
					with his spontaneous excitement and again that’s something 
					we have tried to create in Nawras with our pleasingly 
					different open plan office environment where everyone can 
					join in the latest fun as well as tackle our challenges 
					together.<br>
					My father managed businesses over a long career and he used 
					to take me to his office on weekends right from the time I 
					could walk! He taught me about the power of leadership 
					through teamwork. He’s a great communicator and when I sat 
					among any gathering he was addressing I could see how he 
					inspired, entertained and energised his audience. Our Nawras 
					family can tell you that I have certainly tried to continue 
					this tradition with all hands and at Nawras family meetings.
					<br>
					<br>
					My wife Rose combines her role as a loving wife and mother 
					with being my closest supporter and critic as well as being 
					an informal Ambassadress for Nawras. Being a great customer 
					she helps me all the time with feedback on our Nawras 
					services both from herself and anyone else she may meet. She 
					has also provided invaluable help in resolving customer 
					concerns and has an enviable reputation for introducing new 
					customers.<br>

                    <br>
                    The best piece of advice that I ever got is to never give 
					up. I think one has to have patience in life, lots of it, 
					never cease to make adjustments where improvement is 
					possible but, above all, one should never give up one’s 
					chosen path and pursue it resiliently. I have seen many 
					people embarking on a new idea with the hope of making it 
					big with a snap of their hand. Experience has taught me that 
					it is hard work that is rewarded in the long run. So if I 
					was asked to give my best advice, then I would encourage 
					everyone never to give up and assure them that it is only 
					with a strong vision, unstoppable determination and sheer 
					hard work that each of us will be successful. It is 
					determination that has led me to realise my ambitions and I 
					hope that my statements here push all readers to pursue 
					their ambitions and give them the motivation, courage and 
					resilience to overcome any obstacles they may face along the 
					way.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

					<br>
					Work productively throughout the day Take care of important

					during the course of the day especially for lunch Put aside 
					an hour to return phone calls and e-mails Make a list at the 
					end of the day of the most urgent matters that need to be 
					attended the next day and leave it on your desk Let 
					everybody in the office know your schedule, so that everyone 
					knows when to book time Go home at a reasonable hour and try

                    The Best Advice that I ever got is – Share experiences! 
					Don’t give advice!’<br>
					<br>
					This is part of the training we must undergo whilst joining 
					a forum as a member of the EO (Entrepreneurs Organisation) 
					or YPO (Young Presidents Organisation). What it means is 
					that when someone approaches you with an issue or a 
					situation, don’t undermine the person by giving advice. i.e 
					avoid the sentence “I think you should…” Share your 
					experiences instead, good and bad both. i.e “I (or a person 
					I know) had a similar situation, and did (so and so) and the 
					result was (so and so)…”<br>
					<br>
					Hence the person can decide which direction he/she would 
					like to take all the while keeping their self esteem intact!
					<br>
					<br>
					This helps you to respect others and vice-versa…<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    One learns many lessons in life that go on to shape the 
					course that it takes. Some of these lessons are learnt from 
					the advice we get from our elders, friends and well-wishers. 
					The best advice I ever got was from my grandfather and it 
					has served me well throughout my life. Once he told me: 
					‘Build castles whenever and wherever you go abroad’. What my 
					grandfather actually meant by castle was not a building but 
					a friend. He always considered a good friend like a castle 
					which can help you and protect you when nothing or nobody 
					can.<br>
					<br>
					I recall an incident in 1991 when I travelled to Sweden with 
					a close friend. Soon after reaching there we got the bad 
					news that the mother of my friend was hospitalised. We 
					cancelled everything and wanted to fly back home. To our 
					horror there was no flight available till next day. Seeing 
					our plight, a friend in that country quickly chartered a 
					three-seater plane to make our immediate return possible. 
					Recalling my grandfather’s advice I became convinced forever 
					that a friend in need is a friend indeed. I got the chance 
					to meet that friend after a long time when he recently came 
					to Oman as part of the official delegation and felt the same 
					warmth. I have benefited from this piece of advice from my 
					grandfather and made friends wherever I have gone. I would 
					like others too to do the same. After all, as Oscar Wilde 
					once said, the best thing
					to do with good advice is to pass it on.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    “In Today’s World, To Stay where you are, you have to run” 
					by Alvin Toffler, is the best advice that I have got in 
					life. “Change” is the word that one must adapt too in this 
					fast moving world. No organisation or individual can sit on 
					their laurels and expect progress. You have to change and 
					move really fast with time, as every day you discover new 
					things being invented and being applied in your day-to-day 
					life. <br>
					<br>
					Thus both in your organisation and in your personal life, 
					seek changes and improvements that will make the 
					organisation more profitable and also bring about beneficial 
					changes in your own personal life. Inspire everyone in the 
					organisation, family and friends to stay up-dated on all 
					relevant matters and automatically you would be instrumental 
					in bringing about changes for yourself and others for the 
					betterment of people close to you. Preach the above message 
					whole-heartedly and lead your team by setting examples, 
					personally. Automatically your subordinates will follow as 
					they see benefits for themselves when they adapt to changes 
					that bring about self and organisational improvements. 
					Personally I have improved performance by making use of the 
					computer professionally, inspiring others to learn the very 
					best use of the same; making known to people the mistakes I 
					have made and the repercussions of the same, so that it is 
					not repeated by others; to make best use of my time in my 
					profession and spend quality time with my family; always 
					keep your ears and eyes open to implement even small changes 
					that improve operations and quality of life for the

                  	Take a measured approach</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    As a proud Turkish national I always used to demonstrate the 
					attributes of my countrymen in business with a fearless and 
					hot blooded approach to dealing with people that could 
					sometimes be expressed as reacting too quickly in a 
					short-tempered manner. I used to get very enthusiastic and 
					perhaps too excited about issues.<br>
					<br>
					So probably the best advice I ever got was from my boss when 
					I worked in the automotive business in Saudi Arabia. He was 
					a Malaysian, very experienced, and said that to be a better 
					manager and business leader I needed to make changes to my 
					attitude. What he meant was dont be confrontational and to 
					take a more measured approach in meetings. Even if I did not 
					agree – take my time to respond. Consider what was being 
					said and then come back with a calmer, more measured 
					approach to the issue and business challenge.<br>
					<br>
					At the heart of his advice was to make sure I did not just 
					react quickly – but took a more considered and proactive 
					approach to the way I did my job. A more softer, more 
					debating and inclusive approach to the way I worked. That is 
					an advice that has stayed with me throughout my time in 
					Saudi Arabia and since moving to Oman I continue to use the 
					advice he gave me every day. His advice – and I am still in 
					regular contact with him – steers the way I manage business 
					today and helps in ensuring I can get the best out of the 
					people I work with at all levels through the Zubair 
					Automotive organisation.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

					(mind). The work ball is like a rubber band, so everytime it 
					is thrown on the ground it bounces back. But the family, 
					health, friends and spirit are like glass balls. While 
					juggling them in life, if one misses any one of these they 
					fall down and there is a chance that they may either break 
					or get bruised. So while work is important it is equally 
					important to take care of your family, health, friends and 
					spirit. Work hard, but play hard too and occasionally take a 
					break from work. Actually, they are linked to each other, if 
					one looks after one’s family and health, it translates into 
					more energy at work. This is an overall work-life balance 
					that we all need to achieve. I am trying to emulate this in 
					my life, but it is not easy. If I see people working late at 
					night or over weekends in office, I tell them to go home and 
					spend time with their family and relax, because if they lose 
					their family, health or spirit then they cannot work 
					anymore.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    I can’t really say if this is the best advice that I ever 
					got, but it has certainly stuck with me. One of my very 
					first bosses told me that “If you had to choose between 
					being “rich”, “good looking” or “lucky”… choose “lucky” 
					every time; and then he followed with the comment “and the 
					more practice you get the luckier you become”. <br>
					<br>
					I offer this advice because I truly believe that we all need 
					a little luck behind us to get a window of opportunity; and 
					then we can greatly leverage that little piece of luck by 
					being educated in our field of work to be able to know what 
					to do when the opportunity actually presents itself. I would 
					offer that it is necessary to learn the basics and continue 
					to grow your knowledge from that foundation. As your 
					knowledge increases your chance for ‘luck’ will also 
					increase. <br>
					<br>
					In the business world one needs to be practiced and prepared 
					to position oneself to make the most of every possibility 
					that comes thereafter to the benefit of each party. In my 
					view, this means to be prepared for any potential outcome by 
					being completely up-to-speed on the issue at hand. If one is 
					as informed as possible, this knowledge can be used to find 
					a win-win position for each party. It is complete nonsense 
					to think that a one sided agreement is any form of agreement 
					at all. We all have the ability to make our own breaks and 
					this can be accomplished by being prepared. One can be 
					prepared through experience gained from “practice”.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                  	Never go for short term gain</font></b><br>
                    <br>
                    Never go for the short term gain, rather always try to see 
					the total picture to appreciate the long term benefit and if 
					you can’t afford to do something, wait until you can afford 
					it. Never accept second best. My parents always taught me 
					the value of good quality and the fact that the cheapest is 
					not always the best. They also taught me patience which was 
					reinforced when I worked in Japan and had to sit through 
					many interminably long meetings seeking to bring together a 
					consensus agreement to a knotty issue or a costly business 
					solution. I suppose my whole career after I left law has 
					been in luxury goods. Until today, I still remember the 
					first merchandise director I ever encountered when I became 
					a management trainee in Liberty of London, Mrs Pennington. 
					To a boy straight out of law studies and practising in 
					articles, she was a frightening, powerful, hugely 
					knowledgeable woman who I respected for her amazing take on 
					things. It was she who told me never to accept second best, 
					even if it meant having to wait longer.<br>
					<br>
					I therefore cannot mention one person but have to recognise 
					all those who have influenced me throughout my career 
					spanning 30 years to date. The message however was always 
					the same: Wait for the best to come. It will always prove to 
					be the better option in the long run, and ultimately even 
					cheaper. In business, I have pursued this philosophy by not 
					allowing expansion to run out of hand and not over 
					stretching the business and cash flow. It would be very easy 
					for example with Amouage now becoming widely recognised 
					internationally to reduce the price and to pursue much 
					higher volumes by selling to a lower tier of retail 
					operators. <br>
					<br>
					Price is often the only barrier to increasing sales in for 
					example the USA – a potentially huge market. If I reduced 
					the retail price by 50 per cent I could immediately win huge 
					increases in sales volume and we would become aligned with 
					the so-called “masstige” products like Chanel or Dior 
					fragrances. We would increase our turnover dramatically. The 
					volume increase would easily cope with the loss of margin 
					and the business would probably be profitable as long as the 
					volume held up. The problems are however that I would have 
					to increase my capacity at the factory significantly and 
					bring in more people to cope with the demand. Things would 
					be great you might think. For the first two years, we would 
					be making good sales. Cashflow would be under strain as we 
					would have to buy so many more raw materials but we could 
					probably cope. Staff would increase to double our current 
					complement and we would be hailed for employing more local 
					employees. By five years, we would see the brand elsewhere 
					in all other markets begin to suffer as the customers who 
					are our current loyal consumers and who believe they are 
					buying something truly special and unique in Amouage, a true 
					niche brand, would be sick of seeing it everywhere and worn 
					by everyone.<br>
					<br>
					In ten years, unless we could maintain the volumes by 
					spending huge sums on global advertising campaigns, we would 
					probably have quit the market entirely as our band would 
					have declined to such a great extent and it would no longer 
					be possible to rescue it and take it back up to the top end. 
					One thing I have learnt is that it is very easy to take a 
					brand downmarket and to chase the dollar but in the long 
					term, it will destroy a luxury niche brand, never able to 
					climb back up to its previous positioning.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    The best advice I ever got is from Robin Sharma and my wife. 
					Robin Sharma’s advice is professional while that from my 
					wife is personal. Robin Sharma says, Your organisation and 
					you are most vulnerable when you are most successful. 
					Success actually breeds complacency, inefficiency and worst 
					of all “arrogance”. So what should one do?<br>
					<br>
					“The more successful your organisation and you become, the 
					more humble and devoted to your customers you need to be. 
					The more committed to efficiency and relentless improvement 
					you need to be.” I try to the best of my ability in my 
					corporate life to follow this and make sure that complacency 
					and arrogance has no place in my life. In our company, we 
					concentrate all the time on the customer’s needs and see how 
					to fulfill his requirements in the best possible way. My 
					wife says that as we get more and more electronically 
					connected, we become less and less connected emotionally. 
					Everyone wants to be connected emotionally whether he or she 
					expresses it or not. So what should one do. To listen to 
					someone intently is the best way to honour the person and to 
					develop a deep and lasting human connection. This should be 
					done with a positive mind set, high self respect, internal 
					peace and a strong spiritual connection. When your family 
					life is happy you will perform better at work. There is no 
					point in being successful but sad. As my wife says, ‘Life is 
					a celebration. So enjoy every part of it.’<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    The best advice that I ever got is to keep a ‘Daily Action 
					List,’ ready always and this has helped me both in my 
					personal and professional life. I got this sound advice from 
					my brother, Dr Mohamed Bin Musa al Yousef and I have been 
					following it since the last six years.<br>
					<br>
					“Action List” precisely refers to the “Things To Do”. Once 
					the Action List is ready, the same can be updated every 
					second day and can be reviewed periodically, say on a weekly 
					basis. Also for any new thing which I remember, I make it a 
					point to immediately enter it in my mobile phone or to call 
					my personal assistant to include it in the “Action List”. 
					This practice has helped me immensely in not forgetting 
					anything, segregating ‘short term’ and ‘long term’ goals, 
					not stressing the brain, being more focused, completing 
					tasks within a fiven time schedule, and increasing 
					productivity.<br>
					<br>
					As soon as I joined OIFC in February 2009, I set this 
					practice amongst the management team and I review their 
					Action Lists on a weekly basis. Initially, there were 
					complaints because people were not used to this practice but 
					over the last one year, everyone has realised that this 
					practice makes life much easier because of its benefits and 
					it helps every one to be more focused, to prioritise things 
					and be more target oriented.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

					the board of Britannia Industries as an executive director

					place as if you are the owner”. A simple few words but much

                    The best advice I got in life was from my late beloved

                    Trying to point out one piece of advice that has influenced 
					me significantly is difficult as I have been very lucky to 
					meet inspiring people throughout my life. However, some 
					advice shapes personalities and attitudes and so in that 
					context one of the best pieces of advice I got was in the 
					early part of my career from a colleague and mentor. What he 
					told me was that people should not spend all their time 
					thinking about the future and how to get there but instead 
					they should put most of their efforts in doing the best with 
					tasks at hand as what they do now is what they will be 
					judged on. <br>
					<br>
					I think anyone following this advice has a higher chance of 
					success. Someone who is patient and understands that it is 
					more important to do the best they can with the challenges 
					and responsibilities they face at work shows both 
					professionalism and reliability – two very important traits 
					for any successful leader. I therefore believe following 
					this advice has helped me progress in my career. <br>
					<br>
					I think the opposite of this is that those who are always 
					thinking of the future and are too busy planning rather than 
					trying to focus on the work at hand and so proving through 
					their performance find that sooner or later their career is 
					not where they would like it to be. Of course having said 
					all this one must still have some sort of career plan in 
					mind.<br>

                    The best advice that I have ever got is – Do what’s right 
					not what’s easier. While faced with a choice one is tempted 
					to go in for the latter option, but it is essential that we 
					resist the temptation and choose the right path. Success is 
					to be measured not so much by the position that one has 
					reached in life as by the obstacles he/ she has overcome 
					while trying to succeed. Saying that something is not 
					possible is the beginning of failure.

                    <br>
                    It’s not always easy to remember all the advices one has 
					received in one’s life time and then pick up the best. From 
					the moment one becomes aware of his surroundings he starts 
					getting advices on what he has to do and more importantly 
					what he has not to do. The list of negative advices 
					outnumbers the positive ones. I am tempted to remember the 
					most obvious advice given by all parents to their young one 
					of my time, i.e., ‘work hard, do your duties and the fruits 
					of your efforts will follow’.<br>
					<br>
					Nevertheless, the most important advice that I got was from 
					my father. His advice was: never ever consult palmists or 
					fortune tellers; instead take well-informed decisions and be 
					responsible for your actions. Fortune tellers sap the 
					decision-making ability of a person. The man then starts 
					walking with crutches... a thing he does not need. He lives 
					a miserable life of dependence. It’s not that all my 
					decisions have scored a bull’s eye. However, in my every 
					success and failure I see my own decision-making ability 
					being tested and for me, this is what matters. Consequently, 
					I never seek a fall guy. And what about a successful 
					decision? To be proved right is a very satisfying moment, 
					it’s sheer happiness. My father’s advice has strengthened my 
					decision-making ability and for this I will always be 
					indebted to him.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    There is nothing called as one best idea since I believe 
					there can be no one fit for any given problem or issue. 
					However, I greatly regard the words and pontifications of 
					Ram Charan, the celebrated Harvard Business School 
					professor. He says that in challenging times it is important 
					to demonstrate personal integrity, to maintain personal 
					credibility and to resist temptations to cut corners while 
					carrying out unpleasant tasks like downsizing. These have 
					been highly inspirational for me to continue my 
					responsibilities on a day-to-day basis. Speak the truth more 
					often. Gather information — from customers, from your 
					customer-facing employees and from sources outside the firm. 
					Another aspect I would like to borrow from Charan is 
					management intensity. This can be defined as deep immersion 
					in the business’s operational details and the day-to-day 
					competitive climate the business is facing, along with 
					hands-on involvement and follow-through. Times have been 
					challenging for most of us and we too are no exception.<br>
					<br>
					Given the general flux the biggest challenge is to get your 
					numbers correct when you don’t know how your accounting 
					period is going to end. Most of us are already talking about 
					recovery and some of the banks and large companies have 
					shown encouraging year-end results for 2009. But, for most 
					of us it has been quite daunting. At Jawad Sultan Group we 
					constantly believe in creating new avenues and assets so 
					that these bear fruits in times to come.

                    <br>
                    Whilst almost everyone knows of Dr Stephen Covey’s “Seven 
					Habits of Highly Effective People,” very few are aware of 
					his “The 8th Habit – From Effectiveness to Greatness”. It 
					was a spiritual journey going through the book and I was 
					deeply influenced by its thought process. The leadership 
					challenge he talks of is firstly about finding your own 
					voice and then inspiring others to find their voice and to 
					achieve organisational greatness in the process. This is 
					done through focus and execution. Focus embodies the 
					modelling and pathfinding roles, whilst execution relates to 
					the aligning and empowering roles. Pathfinding involves 
					creating with others a common vision about your priorities 
					and the values by which you will achieve your priorities. 
					Execution relates to aligning goals and enabling systems for 
					results. Releasing passion and talent, clearing the way 
					before them and then getting out of the way – that’s 
					empowerment. In short, the way to achieve greatness in life 
					is to help others achieve greatness. It is such a noble and 
					profound idea that I have been consciously working on it 
					relentlessly in the last five-odd years. I feel it has 
					helped me, my team-members and the organisation, I work for 
					quite significantly and even in personal life and with 
					friends. It is a journey without an end but one which is 
					satisfying and rewarding.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    I was looking back to the past years in my life and in my 
					career and tried to find a single answer to this question 
					and honestly it was not too easy. This is mainly because 
					there were many people who have influenced me in one way or 
					other in different phases of my life and I have tried to 
					follow many of the good tips that were convincing to me to 
					see if it works for me. This would include CEOs of companies 
					I worked or admired, few sports personalities, professional 
					trainers, parents, and my wife and select few colleagues.<br>
					<br>
					If I were to select one I would go for Jack Canfield. I had 
					an opportunity to attend a one day seminar conducted by him 
					in Oman and have been closely following his, “The success 
					principles” since then. These principles are simple to 
					follow but highly powerful and really practical. I have been 
					using this book and similar books as a personal reference 
					guide for the last seven years and would be happy to say 
					that I have benefited from this in my personal life and also 
					at my work. His principles on goal setting, building strong 
					core team, reject rejections, taking 100 per cent 
					responsibility, taking actions, ask–ask-ask are the ones 
					that have really helped me. <br>
					<br>
					The journey still continues and I feel that I am still 
					learning new things and adopting what is good for me.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    After finishing my education at Sultan Qaboos University, I 
					started my career in the university itself. I wanted to make 
					my mark as a successful career woman and I plunged 
					wholeheartedly into the job. Those were still early days for 
					me and I realised that as a women I would have to work extra 
					hard to prove myself in this male oriented world.<br>
					<br>
					It was during these days that my father sat down with me to 
					advise me about the best way to build my future. He told me 
					to widen my horizon and look at every possible opportunity 
					which came my way. He asked me to leave no stone unturned in 
					my quest for success. If we equate each stone as an 
					opportunity then we can take a good look at it, turning it 
					over and over to determine whether it is worth keeping, 
					discarding or filing for the future. His advice was that if 
					I let an opportunity slip past me someone else would find 
					it, pick it up and succeed.<br>
					<br>
					This advice has stayed with me all my life. I have learnt to 
					focus on my objectives, making sure that no aspect is 
					neglected or left half way through. This has enabled me to 
					move ahead as a businesswoman who has not only attained 
					success herself but has also supported other women to 
					achieve recognition in life.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    They say there are two categories of fools – Those who give 
					advice and those who don’t take it. Having been in the 
					second category many times the one advice I have valued most 
					was given by my boss in India and his advice was, “As a 
					leader, whenever you depend on internal motivation, your 
					cognitive faculties would narrow down in a manner whereby 
					you will not be able to see the things which are apparent to 
					the world. Therefore never ignore inputs from people around 
					you before taking significant decisions.”<br>
					<br>
					It took me a little while to realise the full value of what 
					was said to me. An analogy of this syndrome can be made with 
					the experience one goes through when you are not in the 
					driver’s seat in a car and you suddenly observe and discover 
					structures which were always there on the road that you 
					travelled frequently but had completely missed your 
					attention when occupying the driver’s seat. This happens 
					because in the driver’s seat your focus is on the 
					destination and on the road ahead.<br>
					<br>
					In my professional career, I have used this advice to 
					prevent missing out on the apparent signals when taking 
					decisions. Most importantly, I am extra careful when I feel 
					passionately driven by a goal and am leading a team to 
					fulfill the vision.<br>

                    <br>
                    The best advice I ever got in life is from my father who 
					always says, “I would want you to be well educated rather 
					than being well qualified as knowledge acquisition even if 
					it is through experience or exposure and any source would 
					ensure a definitive growth for any individual both 
					personally and professionally.” This advice has helped in 
					inculcating a greed for learning giving me a distinct 
					advantage in my career growth. I have always been prone to 
					asking questions like “why?, how?, what? etc.” and have 
					never succumbed to presumptions, inhibitions and 
					reservations. Though I was not an academic person I 
					continued to learn from the experiences and learning of 
					knowledgeable people and the environment around me. On the 
					personal front this advice has made me a more satisfied soul 
					imparting a sense of satisfaction. I have been using this as 
					a key management tool by creating a knowledge pool within 
					the organisation so that we keep on ideating and create a 
					universe which is beyond the competitive space. We have 
					always tried to fight the opportunity rather than 
					competition and have succeeded. We always try and grow to 
					our level of incompetency so that our learning quotient is 
					subject to pressures for continuous growth.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    The best advice that I have ever got was ‘Stoop to conquer’. 
					This was not exactly an advice to me but was told to me in 
					the context of how a successful industrialist advised his 
					snotty CEO who came from the public sector. I found this was 
					particularly relevant to me as I had also joined the private 
					sector as a CEO of an investment bank at a young age of 40 
					from a public sector bank, State Bank of India (SBI). The 
					public sector generally makes its executives rigid and 
					arrogant as these organisations operate like semi-government 
					departments. In my case, I had all the circumstances to make 
					me a ‘swollen head’ as I had risen very rapidly in an 
					institution that had enormous competition for promotions and 
					right postings as pyramid becomes narrower as you move up 
					the ladder. I was different from my peers even in the bank 
					as I followed a marketing approach in pursuing my 
					professional career though my employer was not very 
					marketing savvy at that point in time. <br>
					<br>
					I used this advice to my fullest advantage in my 
					professional and personal life. At times, circumstances 
					demand that you have to give-in to the demands of your 
					clients, employees, spouse or children that seem 
					unreasonable but it helps to get much larger gratification 
					in future. With this advice I always keep winning the war at 
					the end even if it requires losing a few battles.

                    <br>
                    The best advice that I ever got is from my guru and mentor 
					Sri Mylai Guruji Sundararam Swamigal, a philosopher par 
					excellence. “Be bold in what you stand for and humility and 
					simplicity in success”, though this appears simple had a 
					profound impact on the way I looked at life around me. The 
					advice changed my outlook towards my personal and 
					professional responsibilities.<br>
					<br>
					Being bold in what one stands for, calls for the highest 
					level of integrity in every walk of life; passion for 
					success against all odds; and total accountability. Humility 
					and simplicity in success, calls for keeping the feet firmly 
					on the ground; success shared; and responsibility towards 
					the eco system. These instilled integrity, passion, shared 
					vision, commitment to CSR while not doing much ado about 
					one’s achievements. I found perfect synergy with Bahwans, 
					who are an embodiment of outstanding performance, commitment 
					to social cause while being absolutely noble and simple.<br>
					<br>
					The performance of Bahwan Cybertek (BCT) is a true 
					reflection of our journey. BCT is among the largest software 
					houses from the region with a workforce of more than 1,200 
					and solutions delivered across four continents and 20 
					countries.<br>
					<br>
					BCT has been recognised by the Dubai government, Oracle, Red 
					Herring, Nasscom for innovation and Deloitte for the third 
					consecutive time. <br>
					<br>
					Passion for success, belief that today’s business’s need to 
					create to lead, led us to innovate for our stakeholders and 
					to focus on creating value for them and the community at 
					large.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    OER has chosen a very interesting and innovative topic for a 
					business magazine! The best advice that I ever got was from 
					my father, which is “What cannot be cured must be endured”. 
					This phrase has a much deeper meaning than what is read 
					first. It basically conveys the following:<br>
					<br>
					Every problem need not have a solution.<br>
					<br>
					Every problem has to be confronted and not run away from.<br>
					<br>
					When you do endure a problem, you will ultimately come out 
					with a solution.<br>
					<br>
					Having been involved in the ‘turnaround of sick companies’ 
					several times in my career, I have come across such 
					situations quite often and have benefited immensely from the 
					above advice. Some people, especially at senior levels hate 
					facing problems that seemingly looks intractable and often 
					pull up their subordinates for coming up with problems 
					rather than solutions. This advice has however taught me to 
					face problems and avoid brushing under the carpet of 
					problems that appear difficult to tackle and consequently 
					enabled me to overcome them. Even in my personal life, it 
					has developed in me a lot of tolerance and helped in 
					strengthening relationships.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

                    <br>
                    Istarted my career as a scientist working in the field of 
					expanding knowledge in materials science. In science it is 
					easy to get carried away with new theories or fancy 
					calculations. The advice here was to analyse all information 
					from different angles and only use it if you had verified 
					its correctness using a number of totally different methods.<br>
					<br>
					This advice has helped me in not taking any information at 
					face value. It forces you to really know what you are doing 
					and at the same time gives you peace of mind with respect to 
					the decisions that you take.<br>
					<br>
					This advice is most usable when there is a high degree of 
					uncertainty. I have used it in estimating cost, risk 
					assessments, oil field development decisions and I use it on 
					a daily basis for anything that has a high cost or can give 
					a significant positive opportunity.<p align="justify" style="margin:3px 10px; " dir="ltr">

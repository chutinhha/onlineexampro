				The joint military exercises and cooperation with the broader 
				anti-piracy movements in the region are a clear indication of 
				the Sultanate’s commitment and ability to deal with this 
				regional security concern<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				Today the southern port city of Salalah is a safe, bustling 
				metropolis where you can conduct modern business and, on a day 
				off, wander through traditional souqs or enjoy miles of pristine 
				beaches. However, this pleasant present belies a romantic 
				history: hundreds of years ago, Salalah was a shelter for 
				pirates and brigands, then an increasingly important stop on the 
				‘incense road,’ an ancient trade route.<br>
				<br>
				Those in the shipping business might be forgiven for taking a 
				dim view of tour guides who promote Oman’s romantic pirate past. 
				And Oman, which might have thought it had left its pirate days 
				behind, has recently learned the hard way that it is not immune 
				to this problem.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DARING PIRATES<br>
				</b>Things began to heat up this June 2009, when the cargo ship 
				MV Charelle was hijacked just 12 kilometres from Oman’s 
				territorial waters. It was held for more than five months off 
				the coast of Somalia before it was released for an undisclosed 
				ransom on December 3. It seems that the pirates that have long 
				bedevilled the western Gulf of Aden – the body of water between 
				Somalia and Yemen – are fishing further afield. Attacks have 
				been reported as far east as Sur, just less than 200 kms from 
				Muscat, at the entrance of the Strait of Hormuz.<br>
				<br>
				This was not the first modern pirate menace near Omani waters, 
				but it was the first successful one. In December 2008, three 
				small skiffs fired rockets at a US cruise ship with more than 
				1,000 people on board. The ship was able to accelerate out of 
				the pirate’s range and arrived safely in Salalah the next 
				morning.<br>
				<br>
				<b>MARITIME SECURITY<br>
				</b>Oman’s stability, prosperity, and developed transport hubs 
				have made it an attractive location for foreign investment over 
				the last few years. With characteristic prudence, the Sultanate 
				has been investing in diversification away from a 
				hydrocarbon-based economy – a strategy which has resulted in 
				solid transport networks, industrial development, and a 
				much-lauded tourism infrastructure.<br>
				<br>
				Further, Oman maintains good relations with its neighbours, both 
				fellow GCC countries and the potentially more troublesome Yemen 
				and Iran. But any investor interested in setting up a business 
				in Oman, especially one involving sea freighting, will be 
				looking to the steps the Sultanate is taking to ensure maritime 
				security. Back in June, the MV Charelle’s distress signal was 
				missed by the Portuguese naval forces dispatched for anti-piracy 
				duties in the area. The Omani authorities responded immediately, 
				but the vessel was already in pirate hands.<br>
				<br>
				Since then, the Sultanate has been working to build capacity to 
				ensure that the security forces can respond as effectively as 
				possible to threats of this nature. The Sultanate has increased 
				cooperation with the EU Naval Force, which has been conducting a 
				military operation, code-named ‘Operation Atalanta’, to combat 
				piracy in the region since December 2008.<br>
				<br>
				<b>PARTNERSHIPS<br>
				</b>Oman has provided berthing and medical facilities for the 
				force, which is made up of ships provided by EU member states, 
				NATO, and a US-led coalition. It appears to have benefited from 
				having a regional partner: the last successful hijacking in the 
				EU Naval Force’s patrolled waters took place in July 2009. <br>
				In light of the security crackdown, pirates are moving further 
				east, where they continue to pose a threat to Oman’s shipping 
				lanes. In recognition of this shift, Oman’s navy and India’s air 
				force agreed to engage in a series of war games designed to 
				improve the forces’ ability to combat ‘sea terrorism’ this 
				October.<br>
				<br>
				“The environment is changing rapidly in terms of terrorism and 
				piracy,” the Indian Air Force (IAF) vice-chief Air Marshal PK 
				Barbosa said in a statement to the l0cal press when the joint 
				exercises were announced. “If the swathe (of piracy) widens, air 
				forces may be called upon to help the navies of different 
				countries already patrolling the Gulf of Aden. If directed to do 
				so, we are prepared,” he said.<br>
				<br>
				The joint exercises concluded in early December, and proved 
				their efficacy within days: on December 7, the IAF dispatched a 
				helicopter in response to a distress call from a Norwegian 
				tanker in the Gulf of Aden. The pirates fled when the IAF fired 
				warning shots. On December 20, a similar mission dispatched a 
				skiff that had been pursuing the Cayman Island-flagged MV 
				Sodlering Ace.<br>
				<br>
				<b>ARAB NAVAL FORCE<br>
				</b>The GCC agreed in October 2009 to establish an Arab Naval 
				Force, tasked with keeping the Red Sea, the Arabian Gulf, and 
				the Gulf of Aden free of pirates. It aims to cooperate with 
				other international anti-piracy efforts, especially the EU Naval 
				Force, by establishing a joint command for one year, hopefully 
				with no need for extension.<br>
				<br>
				Oman took the bilateral relations one-step further by planning 
				joint rescue and relief operations with Iran, which is eager to 
				keep the Strait of Hormuz clear. Nearly a third of the world’s 
				oil – and a very far from insignificant portion of Iran’s export 
				revenue – passes through the Strait. Oman’s ability to maintain 
				close security ties to its unpredictable eastern neighbour is a 
				valuable asset in the quest for regional stability. Despite the 
				strides made by Oman and its international partners, it is 
				difficult to guarantee military protection for the estimated 
				20,000 commercial ships that pass through the Gulf of Aden and 
				Oman’s territorial waters every year. To that end, Oman has 
				encouraged ships to beef up their anti-pirate defences, using 
				techniques like barbed wire, water cannons, <br>
				and flares.<br>
				<br>
				Sonar defences – extremely loud bullhorns that can incapacitate 
				pursuers – are another popular deterrent, and have been 
				installed on many cruise ships. In a more 21st-century move, the 
				Sultanate has aided the EU Naval Force in the development of an 
				internet-based communication system that alerts ships to threats 
				in their area. Ships can also register to travel in convoys with 
				military escort.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">
				<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
				In early December, armed pirates were reported to have attempted 
				to board the merchant ship BBC Togo, but found it hard going 
				when they discovered the stairwells of the ship were cordoned 
				off with barbed wire. The pirates fled to a nearby fishing dhow, 
				just a hundred miles off the coast of Oman, where they were 
				captured on December 2, 2009, by the Dutch navy. Within days, 
				reports of another failed attack emerged, this time on a Greek 
				ship in the Arabian Sea southeast of Oman.<br>
				<br>
				Oman’s anti-piracy measures are increasingly effective, but it 
				is easy to see that the problem is significant. Much of Oman’s 
				success as a trading hub for the region – particularly in 
				transhipment – has been based on its strategic position. It is 
				understandable – not to mention reassuring for investors – that 
				the government has taken such a proactive stance on piracy.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

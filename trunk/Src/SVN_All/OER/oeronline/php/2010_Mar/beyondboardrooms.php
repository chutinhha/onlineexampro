					The Computer Stationery Industry Group is moving from one 
					success to another as it continues to maintain its 
					leadership position in delivering quality printing products 
					to its clients, writes Visvas Paul D Karra after an 
					interview with R Prabakaran, General Manager, Computer 
					Stationery Industry</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<br>
					<b>When OER caught up with R Prabakaran, general manager, 
					Computer Stationery Industry, which owns the prestigious 
					commercial printing press – Oman Printers &amp; Stationers Co 
					(OPS), he was more keen to talk about the achievements of 
					his group rather than himself.<br>
					</b><br>
					</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#C00000">
                    <img border="0" src="images/BEYONDBOARDROOMS.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" vspace="5" style="border: 4px solid #C0C0C0; " width="200" height="358"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">And 
					he has many things to talk about which are more satisfying 
					to him more than anything else. To begin with, Prabakaran is 
					excited about the award-winning streak of OPS, the flagship 
					brand of the group. OPS won the Dubai Print Award for the 
					third year in succession. <br>
					<br>
					OPS also received the “Magazines Aspiration Award” in 
					recognition of best print and binding qualities for a 
					lifestyle magazine printed by them. Prabakaran says that it 
					was a mammoth task competing with many new participants from 
					well established printing giants across continents adding 
					that confidence of the customers is the main inspiration 
					behind such achievements.<br>
					<br>
					But the biggest reason to cheer about is the upcoming silver 
					jubilee anniversary of the group in July. On this occasion, 
					the company is planning on launching a series of new 
					initiatives all designed to give their customers a new 
					experience in quality printing that is unmatched by any in 
					the industry. The company exports more than 40 per cent of 
					its diverse products like business forms, pin mailers and 
					cheques for banks, security documents etc. The list of 
					clients includes ministries, banks, exchange houses and 
					various public and private establishments.<br>
					<br>
					Prabakaran who is a Fellow of Chartered Accountants of 
					India, has vast experience in varied fields and in many 
					continents including Africa and India. He joined Computer 
					Stationery Industry in 1996 as finance manager. Later he was 
					promoted as the Group’s general manager by the shareholders 
					of the company based on his performance.<br>
					<br>
					A completely down-to-earth personality, Prabakaran believes 
					in encouraging ideas at every level of operations. His motto 
					to encourage ideation comes from his perspective to care for 
					employees. Perhaps, OPS is one of the few printing companies 
					in Oman that has five per cent of its staff who are 
					physically challenged. The group also has achieved more than 
					35 per cent Omanisation, exceeding the mandatory 
					regulations. In a competitive market the goal is also to 
					earn good returns for investors, whose support is paramount 
					in all developments. <br>
					<br>
					OPS, being the only ISO certified professional printing 
					house in Oman, continues to invest in latest technologies to 
					bring in the best printing and finishing solutions for every 
					customer needs. <br>
					<br>
					Recently OPS installed the first of its kind instant digital 
					printing machine, which can serve the needs of the entire 
					business community. The new machine can meet everyone’s 
					urgent, limited and personalised print requirements to print 
					catalogues, brochures, invitation cards, menus and even 
					annual reports within a very short time, which cannot be 
					undertaken in conventional printing. With such milestones, 
					Prabakaran is looking forward to many more achievements in 
					future.<br>

				Consultants (HMR) have a number of firsts to their credit – in 
				2004-05, when the Sohar Industrial area took off in a big way, 
				HMR provided environment consultancy services to around 80 per 
				cent of the companies. When integrated tourism complexes like 
				The Wave and Sama Dubai started their projects it was one of the 
				first consultants to be taken on board. Says Sanjeev Kulkarni, 
				group general manager, “We caught various waves in the Sulta</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">nate’s 
				development and each of these has taken us to a higher level in 
				terms of our skill sets and associates.”<br>
				<br>
				<b>Looking back <br>
				</b>HMR is a multidisciplinary engineering firm, with a proven 
				track record of excellence in its practice. Established in 1994, 
				it is an ISO 9001: 2000 certified firm. Its strong credentials 
				has made it a preferred service provider with the World Bank; 
				International Finance Corporation; UNEP (ROWA) and other leading 
				national and international corporations and banks. With over a 
				decade of experience in the GCC and MENA region its focuses on 
				client needs and their unique requirements. “We believe in 
				sharing our knowledge with our clients to develop innovative 
				cost solutions that address our client’s needs,” says Suresh 
				Kumar, group corporate manager.<br>
				<br>
				HMR has developed an enviable reputation for providing service 
				tailored specifically to meet client’s needs, establishing its 
				place as the region’s premium environmental and engineering 
				consultancy firm. Its strengths include a multidisciplinary 
				consulting including a range of in-house technical specialists; 
				a flexible and responsive approach to clients changing 
				circumstances or priorities; an in-depth awareness of the needs 
				of its clients; entrepreneurial business dedicated to providing 
				innovative solutions and excellent corporate support in IT.<br>
				<br>
				Its approach is to maintain a full range of in-house expertise; 
				HMR provides a wide range of benefits to its clients through its 
				commitment to knowledge of the environmental conditions across 
				the region, its understanding of environmental regulatory 
				framework in place and state of the art environmental monitoring 
				equipment.<br>
				<br>
				The service HMR provides is comprehensive and unique. Operating 
				to international quality standards, with extensive experience in 
				regional and global issues, HMR delivers tailored environmental 
				solutions for every environmental issue. Key sectors in which 
				HMR works includes – exploration, production for oil and gas and 
				mining, refining and downstream petrochemicals, light and heavy 
				industries, infrastructure and utilities, tourism and waterfront 
				developments, energy and power, ports and harbours. Says 
				Kulkarni, “Till 2003-04 most of our business was from Petroleum 
				Development Oman (PDO), but since then we have diversified into 
				various other verticles. We are thankful to PDO for their 
				support during our initial days”.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Due diligence<br>
				</b>Industrial, commercial and regional</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
				developments invariably require some form of environmental 
				impact assessment (EIA) study proposed project. A first step in 
				this process throughout the Middle East and North Africa is to 
				undertake an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study.<br>
				HMR has extensive experience in conducting preliminary 
				environmental feasibility studies and in undertaking full scale 
				EIAs in all sectors. Says Kulkarni, “We have successfully 
				negotiated per-mits for challenging situations such as coastal 
				set back, conservation sites, archaeological sites, project 
				early works, contaminated site remediation, marine dredging, 
				land reclamation etc.” HMR has done such studies for a number of 
				clients like Sohar Refinery, Dhofar Power, Oman India Fertiliser 
				Company (OMIFCO), PDO etc. <br>
				<br>
				Typically, clients and governments engage HMR’s specialised 
				services in environmental monitoring and auditing right from the 
				initial EIA and permitting phases through the construction and 
				commissioning phases and seek continued support during the 
				operational phase until fit-for-purposes environmental, health 
				safety systems are put in place. HMR pioneered groundwater 
				remediation at a historic leaking underground storage tank site 
				in Oman having successfully negotiated clean up levels and 
				treatment methodology with the Ministry of Environment and 
				Climate Affairs. Says Kumar, “We had worked with the Ministry of 
				Environment to develop an IT system to build maintain and manage 
				the database for solid waste, hazardous waste and groudwater 
				pollution, on latest technologies.” “HMR is sensitive to its 
				responsibility to the community and continues to promote social 
				entrepreneurship and sustainability. This ethos is embedded in 
				all aspects of our operational and commercial activities,” adds 
				Kulkarni.<br>

				Environment. It also developed a unique application for the 
				Ministry of Housing for Krookie printing. There was a remarkable 
				improvement in efficiency and accuracy for delivering Krookie to

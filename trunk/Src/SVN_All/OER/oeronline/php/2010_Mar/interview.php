				<font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Bahar has been voted as the No 
				1 Greatest Brand in Oman. Your first reactions on this honour?<br>
				</b>It is a matter of pride, that despite being in a category 
				with products from multinational companies, a local Omani brand 
				has been able to get this singular honour. What is more 
				significant is the fact that it is the people of Oman who have 
				chosen us as the greatest brand. <br>
				<br>
				<b>The business environment has been challenging in the last 
				year. How has your business been during this period?<br>
				</b>Businesswise we have seen an improvement due to various 
				factors – during the first half of the last year we had an 
				advantageous material cost. We grew well in our export markets, 
				our product extensions and new packaging gave us enhanced shelf 
				appeal. We have upgraded our product quality and are giving 
				added value to our customers. <br>
				<b><br>
				One would assume that Bahar does not spend as much on 
				advertising and marketing as some of its competitors, despite 
				this you have been recognised as a leader across categories. How 
				do you explain this? <br>
				</b>In various shops in the interiors Bahar’s activities 
				continues to be quite intense. We do not have the same 
				propensity to spend as our multinational counterparts, but where 
				it is relevant we do invest in brand promotion. We design 
				activities to promote our products in relevant markets and have 
				devised cost effective solutions for doing these. We have 
				regular roadshows and promotions, which attracts new customers. 
				All this strengthens our brand loyalty.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				<b>There is a perception that in a category like detergents 
				there is little brand loyalty. Do you agree with this? <br>
				</b>Bahar as a brand has been in existence for the last 27 years 
				and we have our own set of loyal customers who have been 
				extremely supportive of us. Omanis take innate pride in 
				supporting their own products and they are smart enough to know 
				as to which products give them good quality at a reasonable 
				price. Bahar is around five per cent cheaper than detergents 
				from other multinational companies. In addition a national 
				product provides employment for locals and people are aware of 
				this. We were the first detergent company in the Sultanate to 
				get an ISO 9001 certification, and have kept up with customer 
				expectations with technological upgradations. Our reach is much 
				better than other brands as we are present in 98 per cent of 
				retail shops in the Sultanate either directly or through our 
				dealers. <br>
				<b><br>
				Have brand extensions helped Bahar to gain more customer 
				mindspace? <br>
				</b>We have 15 product extensions, which cover the entire 
				cleaning and hygiene needs of a family. So most of our customers 
				tend to use a number of our products. We build upon this by 
				giving added benefits like free samples etc. <br>
				<b><br>
				How would you describe the average Bahar customer?<br>
				</b>The average Bahar customer belongs to the medium to high 
				income household for whom functionality, convenience and 
				affordability is critical. We attach a lot of importance to the 
				ethnic range, for example we use Bukhoor, a popular perfume in 
				our products. </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

            courageous detour from the usual flamboyant US blueprint is a 
            welcome change not least because the car has an attractive price.

            <img border="0" src="pg54.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" height="158">Disregarding 
            the geographical history behind the making of the Epica, what 
            becomes more practically apparent about the new four-door mid-size 
            sedan after a road test is that its styling is impressive, its 
            handling is consistently good, and its all-round performance from a 
            modest 2.0 litre-engine is mostly satisfying. Above all, its price 
            tag - which starts from RO4,395 - is great value. <br>
            OER test drove the middle-of-the-range LS (AW) model which can be 
            yours for around RO5,400. The top-of-the-range LT model gains an 
            airbag for the front passenger, 16-inch alloy wheels, traction 
            control, dual zone air conditioning, 8-way power front seats, speed 
            sensitive power steering, a 5-disc CD player, front fog lamps, and 
            mounted radio controls on the steering wheel. It is priced around 
            RO6,700. <br>
            The Epica's immediate rivals in the local market are the Hyundai 
            Sonata, Kia Magentis and Madza6. It is also pegged somewhere between 
            the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Corolla although it does not stray 
            too far away (in terms of price and engine capacity) from the Opel 
            Omega (see OER August review), GM's German-built sedan managed by 
            Saab, which competes against the Nissan Maxima and Peugeot 607.

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Outdoors</b><br>
            The Epica has quite a calm and composed persona with classic yet 
            simple elegance. It features fine luxury touches usually applied to 
            more expensive cars. A dramatic arching roofline and burly bonnet 
            along with dynamic jewel-like headlamps that are distinctively 
            narrow and sleek. A monochrome appearance and flared fenders give 
            the car a bold, sporty feel. Entry to the Epica is by keyless remote 
            that also has a button to open the boot. The LS model has 15-inch 
            alloy wheels. The LT model has power-folding remote outside mirrors.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Indoors</b><br>
            Once inside the Epica, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the level 
            of quality workmanship and how attractive the design of the 
            upholstery and fittings are. Again, it's just enough to make you 
            think this good-looking sedan is a cut above some of its rivals in 
            this segment of the market. There are some very thoughtful touches. 
            For instance, there are loads of storage compartments for occupants 
            to stow knick-knacks and there is a button to automatically open the 
            boot which is conveniently located on the driver's door adjacent to 
            his/her power adjustable seat.<br>
            The climate control is worth a special mention. Air from the unit is 
            very efficiently dispensed from ducts - the top-of-the-range model 
            has automatic A/C with an outside temperature display. <br>
            Inside, there's generous space for front and rear occupants. 
            Notably, rear seat passengers have more than adequate headroom and 
            legroom.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Safety</b><br>
            Standard safety features include a driver's airbags. The 
            top-of-the-range LT model is fitted with an air bag for driver and 
            passenger. Reinforced side-impact beams as well as integrated front 
            and rear crumple zones also reinsure impact safety. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Performance</b><br>
            Choose between a four-speed automatic or 5-speed manual. Under the 
            bonnet is a powerful yet smooth 16-valve DOHC D-TEC in-line 
            six-cylinder engine which pumps out 129 hp at 5,400 rpm. It offers 
            180 Nm of torque at 4,200 rpm. The engine is quiet, even at high 
            speeds while tyre drone on most surfaces is not particularly 
            noticeable. No data on its fuel efficiency was presented so the jury 
            is still out on whether it gobbles fuel or not.<br>
            The power steering does not misbehave. Handling is exceptional and 
            one of the car's best attributes. Chevrolet explains that ride 
            control is entrusted to a four-wheel independent suspension made up 
            of double wishbones up front and a five-link rear set-up. MacPherson 
            struts, anti-roll bars and gas-charged shocks provide the handling 
            control without detracting from ride quality. ABS and TCS are only 
            available in the LT model where you also get treated to 
            speed-sensitive power steering.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>The finishing line</b><br>
            All in all, the Epica provides good looks, a spirited performance, 
            and some great features; all at a very attractive price. The Epica 
            joins Chevrolet's new 2004 entry-level vehicle, the Aveo, which will 
            aim to carve a major slice of the small car market. <br>

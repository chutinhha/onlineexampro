				Inderjeet Singh, Senior Manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 
				holds a Ph.D in energy efficiency in buildings from the Indian 
				Institute of technology Delhi, and has been working in the area 
				of GHG emission reduction, carbon foot-printing and emissions 
				trading right in India. Currently, he has been associated with 
				various capacity building programmes related to promotion of 
				renewable energy technologies, efficient building design and GHG 
				emission reduction in the oil and gas sector. Dr Singh talks to 
				Sunil Fernandes on a range of subjects from renewable energy to 
				water foot print<br>
				<br>
				</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>You are part of the 
				sustainability team at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). What does 
				being part of the sustainability team imply?<br>
				</b>Being part of the sustainability team implies a complete 
				range of activities. It could involve consultancy services in 
				lowering carbon footprint, water footprint, carbon capture and 
				storage, energy aspects, including renewable etc. <br>
				<br>
				<b>How is water foot print different from carbon footprint?<br>
				</b>Carbon footprint is a global issue, while water footprint 
				might not be so. Consider an example of advisory services to a 
				beverage company or a brewery company; water footprint would be 
				a local subject here, if the consumption by these industries 
				adversely affects the local community. This is because water may 
				be scarce in that locality, and this affects the life of the 
				people in and around the locality where the industry is 
				situated. <br>
				<br>
				You talked of water footprint. The oil and gas industry too has 
				a lot of water to be disposed off. <br>
				<br>
				Typically, this is the other side of the coin. As explained 
				before what we are talking of here is the water scarcity problem 
				that affects the local population. In the instance of the oil 
				and gas industry it is safely disposing of the water. Also, 
				water foot print could include contamination of water. There are 
				some pollution control boards in India that have now opted for 
				consent to operate on the grounds that there will be zero 
				discharge of water. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Could you elaborate on the clean development mechanism (CDM)?<br>
				</b>To give you an example, in the Middle East, power is 
				generated through the use of natural gas. In India a lot of 
				power is generated with the use of coal. According to the clean 
				development mechanism, if you are taking-up any opportunities 
				which reduces the emission of green-house gases and it is not 
				viable on a stand-alone basis, then such projects will be 
				registered as candidates for CDM. What then happens is that the 
				emission reduction achieved through these initiatives becomes a 
				tradable commodity in the international market. <br>
				<br>
				<b>What is the potential for renewable across the globe and in 
				the Middle East?<br>
				</b>Germany is the country that is leader in the field of wind 
				power generation. Countries like India do not have wind for the 
				entire year and the potential is in select places. In India 
				eight states were identified, with the state of Tamil Nadu 
				having the maximum wind power generation. With the level of 
				incentives and tax holidays, these projects are competitive. 
				Also, there are no fuel costs with wind energy and there is 
				always an advantage if you have CDM. In countries like Oman, 
				there is a huge potential for Solar energy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				<b>PwC has recently been awarded the first Carbon Capture and 
				Storage project by ONGC, India. Can you give more details?<br>
				</b>Recently, PwC has been awarded with the first Carbon Capture 
				and Storage (CCS) project by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of 
				India. Work on Clean Development Mechanism advisory will 
				commence once CCS is adopted as a CDM activity. CCS has its own 
				set of issues. Presently, what CCS involves is capturing carbon 
				dioxide from the atmosphere and then sealing it. Technology 
				providers are giving assurances that the carbon dioxide pumped 
				into the ground will stay there for several hundred years. The 
				issue is that there is no certainty and no guarantee that there 
				would be no carbon dioxide leakages. Tests have been done and it 
				is seen that there has been no leakage for the last 10 years. 
				The fact remains that there has to be a political decision to 
				allow CCS to be one of the plausible mechanisms to reduce green 
				house gas emissions. I can assure you that once this happens, 
				the Middle East and North Africa region can see substantial 
				reduction in green house gas emissions, by pumping a lot of 
				carbon dioxide into the ground. <br>
				<br>
				<b>When choosing a location for CCS, as in the case of ONGC, 
				what are the factors involved?<br>
				</b>ONGC’s CCS project is located at Ankleshwar and geology 
				plays an important role while selecting a location.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Are these CCS projects viable?<br>
				</b>I do not think it is a question of viability; the pertinent 
				point is first getting the approvals in place. There has to be a 
				legislation and then investments, benefits and other aspects can 
				well be worked out.

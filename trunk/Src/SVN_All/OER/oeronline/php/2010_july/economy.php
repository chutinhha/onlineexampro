					<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">With feasibility studies

					Oman begins to reap benefits from the railways</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>

					</b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					<b>When the US’s great eastern and western rail networks 
					were linked in 1869, the final spike was cast out of gold to 
					symbolise the wealth, which the transcontinental railroad 
					would generate for the young country. In Russia, Tsar<br>
					</b><br>
					Alexander I commissioned the Trans-Siberian railway to link 
					supplies of raw materials in the east with manufacturing 
					centres in the west, generating enough income to fund an 
					empire, which stretched across eleven time zones. The lesson 
					of history, it seems, is that train networks are vital 
					ingredients in a country’s economic development. Investing 
					in this particular mode of infrastructure lays the rails, so 
					to speak, for volumes of commerce which auto, sea, and air 
					networks would have trouble supporting. Having a rail 
					network is, therefore, a mark of a truly advanced economic 
					powerhouse.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Pan-GCC network<br>
					</b>This point has not been lost on the GCC member 
					countries. After years of planning, a decision was reached 
					in 2004 to develop a pan-GCC rail network. The current 
					proposal, unveiled in 2009, calls for a line, which will 
					stretch, some 2000km from Kuwait’s border with Iraq down to 
					Salalah in the southern tip of Oman. Arabian Business 
					reported early this year that tenders for the estimated 
					$25bn network will be announced in the first quarter of 
					2010, with construction beginning by 2013 and the first 
					commercial use as early as 2017. Trains are to run at up to 
					180 km/h.<br>
					<br>
					This project will link to a series of rail developments 
					already underway within the GCC. Saudi Arabia is far and 
					away the furthest ahead in the game, with over 1000km of 
					track already operational and two massive projects underway: 
					the North South Rail, an exclusively freight line linking 
					Riyadh to the north of the country, and the East-West rail, 
					also known as the Landbridge, which will link Jeddah to 
					Riyadh and upgrade the existing track onwards to Dammam.<br>
					<br>
					The UAE has also spearheaded rail development with the 
					opening of the region’s first metro, in Dubai, and with the 
					Union Railway, which will link nascent networks throughout 
					the seven Emirates.<br>
					<br>
					Qatar has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Deutsche 
					Bahn, the German state railway company, for a $25bn 
					integrated system of metro, tram, and intercity trains, 
					including a 40km causeway linking Bahrain. Only in Kuwait 
					have plans faltered somewhat. While the country is eager to 
					connect to the pan-GCC network, momentum to develop a metro 
					within Kuwait has dropped off significantly after a study in 
					2008 concluded the project would likely be a loss-maker.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Industrial links</b><br>
					Oman, for its part, has signalled its commitment to the 
					vision of a thoroughly rail-connected GCC with plans for a 
					northern rail network linking the industrial cities and 
					ports of Sohar, Barka, and Khatmat Malahah in the Batinah 
					region. The Sultanate appointed consultants to carry out a 
					feasibility study in April 2008 for a 200km line from Sohar 
					to Barka, but growing enthusiasm for rail projects has led 
					to a rapid widening in scope for the project. Authorities 
					have been exploring the feasibility of adding a branch line 
					in the Dhahirah region, and expanding into the capital.<br>
					<br>
					This is the most complicated part of the project, as a 
					detailed study of traffic patterns – as they exist, and as 
					they are likely to develop – is needed to assess whether the 
					rail network should continue into the city on the ground 
					level or underground. At the moment, thanks to prudent 
					planning, Muscat does not suffer the legendary traffic seen 
					in many of the rapidly-growing capitals throughout the Gulf. 
					In cities like Doha, heavy industrial vehicles must slog 
					directly through the city centre in some cases, clogging 
					traffic arteries. In the fast-developing emirate of Ras Al 
					Khaimah, a lack of public transport means taxis must 
					sometimes be booked well in advance. The National 
					Engineering Office has partnered with Systra Consulting, a 
					French rail firm, to produce an exhaustive feasibility study 
					weighing the costs and benefits of the system.<br>
					<br>
					They may well come up with surprising results. Given the 
					momentum building behind railway development in the rest of 
					the Gulf, many see Oman’s participation as a foregone 
					conclusion. But while a connection with the pan-GCC network 
					is a good idea, and the proposed Batinah line will do much 
					to ease congestion in the crucial industrial area, it is far 
					from certain that Oman needs a country-wide rail network in 
					the immediate future.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Support Structure</b><br>
					Existing transport infrastructure in Oman is fundamentally 
					different from that of its neighbours. Oman’s relatively 
					large territory – the second biggest in the GCC, after Saudi 
					Arabia – is already criss-crossed with a large road network. 
					Major paved highways link the cities and an efficient and 
					popular bus system is in place, both within the capital and 
					between cities.<br>
					<br>
					Furthermore, the government has injected significant capital 
					into air transport options. The government’s airport 
					operator, Oman Airports Management, plans to award a dozen 
					contracts this year and next to upgrade facilities in Muscat 
					and Salalah, and build four additional airports along the 
					coast and in the country’s heartland. Additional capacity 
					should bring down the admittedly high cost of airfreight.</font></p>
				<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"> 
					<font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
					This is not to say that a rail network would not benefit 
					Oman. In the words of Hussain Al Nowais, chairman of the 
					UAE’s Union Railway Company, “Rail is safer, faster, cleaner 
					and a more economical mode of transportation.” In 
					particular, Oman’s ports would benefit hugely from the kind 
					of rapid, high-volume, low-cost transport a good rail 
					network could provide.<br>
					<br>
					But this long-term competitive advantage in industry will 
					come with a hefty price tag. Oman’s geography poses 
					challenges that many of its more rail-oriented GCC 
					neighbours do not have to face. Unlike sandy Saudi Arabia, 
					much of Oman – especially its most economically active 
					regions – is rocky and crossed by rivers, requiring bridges 
					and tunnels. Part of what made Muscat such a historically 
					strong city is the fact that it is surrounded by mountains, 
					which will provide as much trouble to rail engineers as they 
					once provided to prospective invaders.<br>
					<br>
					Much depends on what value Oman decides to put on the 
					development of industry as opposed to other popular sectors 
					like tourism. Tourist traffic, which is often seasonal or 
					hard to predict, is actually more effectively served by 
					automobiles and airplanes than fixed-line trains.<br>
					<br>
					At this point, it is a question of when, not if, Oman will 
					see fit to make a significant investment into rail project 
					development. The economic benefits, especially to industry, 
					are undeniable. But in keeping with Oman’s reputation for 
					cautious development, large-scale investment in rail may be 
					something to expect in the longer term rather than the 
					shorter.

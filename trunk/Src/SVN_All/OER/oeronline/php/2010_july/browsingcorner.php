					<br>
					<br>
					Malcolm Gladwell’s new book, What the Dog Saw presents 
					nineteen brilliantly researched and provocative essays that 
					exhibit the curiosity his readers love, each with a graceful 
					narrative that leads to a thought-provoking analysis. The 
					explorations here delve into subjects as varied as why some 
					people choke while others panic; how changes meant to make a 
					situation safer — like childproof lids on medicine — don’t 
					help because people often compensate with more reckless 
					behaviour; and the idea that genius is inextricably tied up 
					with precocity. <br>
					<br>
					“You don’t start at the top if you want to find the story. 
					You start in the middle, because it’s the people in the 
					middle who do the actual work in the world,” writes Gladwell 
					in the preface to What the Dog Saw. In each piece, he offers 
					a glimpse into the minds of a startling array of fascinating 
					characters. “We want to know what it feels like to be a 
					doctor,” he insists, rather than what doctors do every day, 
					because “Curiosity about the interior life of other people’s 
					day-to-day work is one of the most fundamental of human 
					impulses.” Like no other writer today, Gladwell satisfies 
					this impulse brilliantly, energising and challenging his 
					readers. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Structured approach </b><br>
					What the Dog Saw is organised thematically into three 
					categories: part one contains stories about what Gladwell 
					calls “minor geniuses,” people like Ron Popeil, the pitchman 
					who by himself conceived, created, and sold the Showtime 
					rotisserie oven to millions on TV, breaking every rule of 
					the modern economy. <br>
					<br>
					Part two demonstrates theories, or ways of organising 
					experience. For example, “Million-Dollar Murray” explores 
					the problem of homelessness — how to solve it, and whether 
					solving it for the most extreme and costly cases makes sense 
					as policy. In this particular piece, Gladwell looks at a 
					controversial programme that gives the chronic homeless the 
					keys to their own apartments and access to special services 
					while keeping less extreme cases on the street to manage on 
					their own.<br>
					<br>
					In part three, Gladwell examines the predictions we make 
					about people. “How do we know whether someone is bad, or 
					smart, or capable of doing something really well?” he asks. 
					He writes about how educators evaluate young teachers, how 
					the FBI profiles criminals, how job interviewers form snap 
					judgments. He is candid in his skepticism about these 
					methods but fascinated by the various attempts to measure 
					talent or personality. <br>
					<br>
					Malcolm Gladwell selected the essays in What the Dog Saw 
					himself, choosing the stories and ideas that have continued 
					to fascinate and provoke readers long after their 
					publication in The New Yorker. The book is an invaluable 
					gift for his existing fans, and the ideal introduction for 
					new readers. <br>
					<br>
					The common theme that runs through all Gladwell’s pieces is 
					his desire to show us the world through the eyes of others – 
					even if the other happens to be a dog. Inevitably this 
					becomes the world as Gladwell sees it through the eyes of 
					others, but his cast of characters is strong enough to 
					withstand the filter. This is what Gladwell does best: he 
					takes an idea, recasts it as a human story, and works it 
					through to its conclusion, taking a strip off conventional 
					wisdoms as he goes. Even when the patterns he identifies are 
					spurious or the conclusions flawed, the arguments he raises 
					are clear, provocative and important. It’s as if he is 
					saying, read this, then go and think for yourself. His 
					pieces, he says, are meant to be “adventures”. </font></p>                </td>

				<font face="Verdana" size="1">An exciting new era for world 
				beating American car brands is now underway in Oman with the 
				launch of Dhofar Automotive – an innovative new joint venture 
				from the Zubair and Shanfari companies. Before the joint venture 
				both Zubair Automotive Group and Shanfari Automotive distributed 
				and sold Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge throughout the Sultanate but 
				now customers will have a far simpler interaction through one 
				Dhofar Automotive outlet in Oman’s main population centres. The 
				newly formed automotive powerhouse is creating a single company 
				for the sale and distribution of the popular Chrysler, Jeep and 
				Dodge (CJD) brands of cars and SUVs from showrooms across the 
				Sultanate.<br>
				<br>
				Customer service and satisfaction is at the very heart of the 
				new company with management committed to ensuring trouble free 
				motoring combined with a low cost of ownership for new and 
				existing Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge vehicles that has seen record 
				breaking sales in the Sultanate in the last three years.<br>
				<br>
				Service is the key<br>
				Speaking at the launch of the new company, Zubair Automotive 
				Group chairman Hani Al Zubair, who will be chairman of the new 
				joint venture company, said: “We are very proud to announce this 
				new joint venture that introduces an exciting new era for 
				Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge customers and our commitment to offer 
				them trouble free motoring delivered through the best prices and 
				levels of services, better maintenance and repair that will give 
				them a lower cost of ownership.” <br>
				<br>
				The new Dhofar Automotive Board of Directors will comprise Hani 
				Al Zubair as chairman, Dr. Adil Said Al Shanfari as vice 
				chairman, board members Husam Al Zubair and Sachin Bawa and 
				managing director Serdar Toktamis. Chris Edwards will become 
				general manager of the newly created company. He currently 
				manages the Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands on behalf of 
				Shanfari Automotive. The new company will also include the RAM 
				and Mopar brands within its portfolio.<br>
				<br>
				Dr. Shanfari, vice-chairman of the Shanfari Group of Companies 
				added: “Today’s announcement is a major step forward for the 
				automotive business here in Oman and our joint venture has been 
				developed based on putting the interests of the customer first 
				and foremost in our thinking. Our customers will now benefit 
				from highly competitive maintenance prices for their vehicles 
				and we are making a significant investment in tools, equipment 
				and training of our technicians to help deliver trouble free 
				motoring in the future.”<br>
				<br>
				The investment that is being committed by Dhofar Automotive also 
				includes the development and construction of a state of the art 
				showroom, sales and servicing (3S) facility in Wattayah as the 
				company’s flagship operation. The company has also identified 
				another location in Muscat that will have a servicing and parts 
				facility with the option to develop a showroom as well to 
				provide another convenient location for customers in the capital 
				area. The new company has the full support and backing of 
				Chrysler Group Middle East and North Africa. Its managing 
				director Jack Rodencal says, “We have enjoyed a long and hugely 
				successful partnership with these leading Omani business houses. 
				The creation of this new integrated business is a development we 
				fully endorse as a logical progression that reflects the way 
				that our three brands of Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge have become 
				one business in recent years.” </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px" dir="ltr">

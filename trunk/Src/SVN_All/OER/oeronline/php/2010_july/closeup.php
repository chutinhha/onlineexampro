                    <font face="Verdana" size="1">The Combined gross national 
					product (GDP) of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is projected 
					to cross the trillion dollars level in 2010. This marks only 
					the second time that the monetary value of economic 
					activities of the GCC has crossed the trillion-dollar level, 
					and helps putting its GDP within an exclusive club of 
					nations. <br>
					<br>
					A report by the International Monetary Agency projects 
					nominal GDP of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman 
					and Bahrain amounting to $1.021trn in 2010 and increasing 
					further to $1.118trn in 2011. According to the same report, 
					GDP of GCC countries amounted to $1.076trn in 2008, but 
					dropped to $869bn in 2009 reflecting changes in oil prices. 
					Right or wrong, the oil sector is uniquely significant to 
					GCC economies by virtue of comprising nearly three quarters 
					of each of treasury revenues and exports as well as one 
					third of the GDP. Hence, oil prices leave their imprints 
					clearly on the fortunes of regional economies.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Oil economies <br>
					</b>More specifically, nominal GDP of Saudi Arabia alone 
					dropped by more than 20 per cent in 2009 to $375 billion due 
					to unfavourable conditions in oil market. Needless to say, 
					Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest exporter of oil, and 
					thus changes in oil prices no matter how small affect the 
					country’s level of income and spending and thereby value of 
					economic activity.<br>
					<br>
					To much of their credit, Saudi authorities openly admitted 
					plunge of GDP while releasing closing accounts of fiscal 
					year 2009. In reality, Saudi Arabia’s economy accounts for a 
					hefty 40 per cent of GDP of GCC, and thus has a material 
					effect on value of regional economies. According to World 
					Bank statistics, Saudi Arabia’s GDP ranks number 23 
					worldwide, ahead of numerous European countries including 
					Norway, Austria and Finland.<br>
					<br>
					Changing GDP value reflects improving conditions of GCC 
					economies, in turn caused by firm oil prices in the 
					international market. The petroleum sector is uniquely vital 
					in GCC economies by virtue of accounting for more than two 
					thirds of treasury income and three quarters of exports. In 
					retrospect, oil prices reached a record $147 per barrel in 
					July 2008 only to hover around $40 per barrel in the first 
					quarter of 2009. Sharp drop in oil prices occurred as a 
					reaction to the global financial crisis, which amongst 
					others caused confidence problems.<br>
					<br>
					However, firm oil prices have since increased and remained 
					strong as a sign of improving global economic prospects 
					thanks to G-20 initiatives. Measures undertaken by G-20 
					include pumping money into local economies in order to 
					generate demand and help raising oil prices.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Qatar leads<br>
					</b>IMF projects GCC economies growing by 4.9 per cent in 
					2010 and rising to 5.2 per cent in 2011. Still, GCC 
					economies grow merely by 0.8 per cent in 2009 on the back of 
					turmoil in oil markets. This was particularly true in the 
					first quarter of 2009 reflecting reactions to the global 
					financial crisis.<br>
					Surprisingly, the IMF mainly attributes improved economic 
					prospects in GCC economies to the outstanding growth level 
					of Qatari economy. The Qatari GDP is projected to grow by 
					18.5 per cent in 2010 and 14.3 per cent in 2011. 
					Undoubtedly, this is an exceptional achievement, reminiscent 
					to performance of few economies like those of China and 
					India.<br>
					<br>
					Amongst other things, the extraordinary development of 
					Qatari economy is testimony of the sustained expansion of 
					gas sector. In fact, Qatar continues to consolidate its 
					position as the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas 
					(LNG). Latest available statistics put output at 54 million 
					tonnes, up from 38 million tonnes a year only three years 
					ago. Yet, nonstop efforts are being exerted to reach the 
					goal of producing 77 million tonnes a year of LNG by 2012.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Abundant resources<br>
					</b>Together, GCC economies comprise around 1.5 per cent of 
					total GDP in the world. In effect, this means value of GDP 
					of some 15 countries is independently more than that of 
					GCC’s GDP. These countries include the US, Japan, China, 
					Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Brazil and India. At more 
					than $14trn, American GDP is undisputedly the largest in the 
					world. As such, value of GCC economies combined accounts for 
					merely seven per cent that of the US.<br>
					<br>
					Yet, notwithstanding the limited size of GCC’s GDP in 
					relation to other global economies, GCC states are 
					particularly noted for controlling substantial oil and gas 
					statistics. Together, GCC countries account for 23 per cent 
					of global oil production. Saudi Arabia is both the largest 
					producer and exporter of oil in the world. <br>
					<br>
					Still, GCC states account for 41 per cent of proven oil 
					reserves in the world. Again, Saudi Arabia alone accounts 
					for 21 per cent of proven oil reserves. At the same time, 
					GCC countries hold for 23 per cent of proven gas reserves in 
					the world. Qatar ranks number three in the world amongst 
					countries with largest gas reserves after Russia and Iran. 
					As in the case of Saudi Arabia in oil, Qatar is the largest 
					exporter of gas in the world. Clearly, GCC states are 
					offering significant resources to the world notably oil and 
					gas, in turn essential for sustaining modern day living. 
					Airplanes, vehicles and a significant number of machineries 
					operate on petroleum products.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Economic diversification<br>
					</b>Still, GCC authorities are required to use oil proceeds 
					to diversify their economies away from the petroleum sector 
					such as industrial development and thus addressing another 
					challenge, namely creating employment opportunities for 
					locals. GCC countries are noted for relatively high 
					population growth rates, around 34 per cent altogether, 
					which translates into entrants of new job seekers in big 
					numbers.<br>
					<br>
					In turn, economic diversification should help GCC economies 
					shield themselves in times of turbulences in oil markets, 
					which occur every now and then, and cannot be ruled out in 
					the future. As mentioned earlier, oil prices reached as high 
					as $147 per barrel in July 2008 yet dropped sharply on the 
					back of the global financial crisis, which caused 
					uncertainties in directions of economies worldwide. </font></p>                </td>

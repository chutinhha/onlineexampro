                <img border="0" src="economy.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="125" height="148">For the Muscat Securities Market (MSM), 2008 was very much a 
                year of two halves. In the first six months of the year, high 
                economic growth and soaring oil prices helped drive impressive 
                capital market growth. In the second half, however, renewed 
                worries about the health of the global economy and a dramatic 
                fall in oil saw many gains reversed as the MSM caught the cold 
                affecting all the region’s bourses. By the end of the year, 
                however, signs of recovery were emerging, thanks in part to 
                assertive government action. <br>
                <br>
                The first half of 2008 saw a continuation of the robust 
                performance of the previous year. Ritesh Jesrani, head of 
                research at Al Madina Financial &amp; Investment Services told OBG 
                that key growth drivers included, “a significant increase in 
                investor participation – both local and foreign – improving 
                company fundamentals, and a vibrant economy backed by high oil 
                prices”.<br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="eco.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="456">While the emergence of the global credit crunch in the third 
                quarter of 2007 had led to the cooling of stock exchanges in 
                North America and Europe, the GCC member states had seemed 
                relatively immune from the ill effects. Indeed, with oil prices 
                surging (partly as a result of speculative pressure) and Gulf 
                sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) acquiring stakes in several major 
                Western financial institutions, the region was widely regarded 
                as benefitting from the crunch. <br>
                <br>
                While Oman did not participate in the move to snap up bargain US 
                and European assets, OBG was told that investors were in some 
                cases purchasing Omani shares as a hedge against declining 
                Western investments. Furthermore, the new enthusiasm that larger 
                Gulf countries developed for purchasing stocks abroad led to 
                many of their citizens putting money into the MSM. By the end of 
                2007, foreigners owned 27.3 per cent of shares listed on the 
                exchange. Meanwhile, the strong growth of the domestic economy 
                had its own natural effect of boosting stocks.<br>
                <br>
                <b>The flip side <br>
                </b>However, the second half saw the MSM hit by two interlinked 
                factors; the worsening of the global economic outlook as the 
                credit crunch spread, and a sharp drop in oil prices (from a 
                high of nearly $150 per barrel in July to around $45 at the end 
                of the year).According to Jesrani, the same foreign investors 
                who had helped boost the exchange in 2007 and the first half of 
                2008 were often the first to get cold feet. “Overseas 
                institutional investors, impacted in some way or the other by 
                the US subprime crisis, were the first to react by withdrawing 
                their holdings in several emerging and frontier equity markets,” 
                he told OBG. “The MSM was no exception to this trend with a 
                reported RO284.5mn ($739.7mn) in net selling by foreigners in 
                just five months from June-October 2008,” he said. Many domestic 
                investors, fearing that Oman’s economy would be hit by the drop 
                in oil (which remains the Sultanate’s major export), also sold 
                off.<br>
                <br>
                “That combination of both foreign and local investors 
                withdrawing their money from the MSM landed a double blow to the 
                local equity markets,” Jesrani said. “This massive selling 
                resulted in an erosion on the exchange of close to RO4.67bn 
                ($12.1bn) from May 2008 till end October 2008.” Indeed, the 
                market lost around 50 per cent of its value from its June 11 
                high.According to Hamid Hamirani, senior vice president of 
                Vision Investment Services, investors have been drawn away from 
                the stock market to bank deposits. According to Hamirani, the 
                drying up of lending to Omani banks from foreign institutions 
                “was partially offset by local banks offering attractive deposit 
                rates to lure local investors.”<br>
                <br>
                “The offer of fixed and certain income was too tempting for 
                investors to resist resulting in a switch from uncertain equity 
                returns to certain fixed deposit income,” he told OBG. While the 
                logic behind this switch seemed strong, it appears that the 
                stock sell-off was triggered as much by sentiment as by 
                appraisal of future value – the perception that stock 
                investments are somewhat volatile having been reinforced by 
                recent events<br>
                <br>
                “To a considerable degree, the panic sell-off was led by 
                widespread confusion and future uncertainty, with investor 
                sentiment dealing its heavy dose of reaction to the sliding 
                equity market,” said Jesrani. “With the current crisis 
                unfolding, the concept of ‘rationale’ investing on the MSM has 
                taken a back seat as investors gave little or no regard to the 
                resilient nature of economic fundamentals and the improving 
                corporate performance of listed entities,” he added.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Government intervention<br>
                </b>
                <img border="0" src="eco1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="199" height="344">With the flight from the MSM gaining momentum – the exchange 
                lost 26.9 per cent in October alone – the government saw fit to 
                step in to bolster the market, launching a RO150mn fund on 
                November 20 in partnership with private financial institutions. 
                The fund is to invest in a range of stocks both to boost 
                liquidity and bolster share values, before selling them once the 
                market is deemed to have recovered.<br>
                <br>
                At the time of writing, the medium-to-long term outlook seemed 
                to be brightening, partly due to the new package, but also 
                because of strong micro and macro fundamentals. Alone among Gulf 
                bourses, which as a whole lost $127bn, the MSM gained in 
                November, albeit by one per cent (the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) 
                fell by nearly a third).<br>
                <br>
                The MSM could perhaps be said to be fortunate to be relatively 
                small, and therefore less subject to speculation than larger 
                regional exchanges which have clocked larger losses, but it also 
                has some key underlying strengths. Whereas some GCC capital 
                markets are still criticised for lack of disclosure, Oman has 
                led the field in championing transparency and regulatory 
                oversight, and was the first Arab country to develop a corporate 
                governance code. The MSM benefits from the oversight of the 
                highly-regarded Capital Market Authority (CMA), which has 
                imposed standards expected by international investors while not 
                stifling growth. While other Gulf bourses may have to force 
                through substantial reforms to aid their recovery and to restore 
                investor confidence, the MSM already has a world-class 
                infrastructure in place. Furthermore – in common with most other 
                GCC members – the Sultanate has a fine macroeconomic base.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Driven by reforms <br>
                </b>“Oman’s strong corporate governance discipline, investor 
                education, ample reserves, diversification programme and prudent 
                policy practices should in theory bode well and add to the 
                fiscal and monetary policy support of the government,” Hamirani 
                told OBG. What is more, with the US Federal Reserve axing 
                interest rates to close to zero, and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) 
                set to follow with its own rate cut, bank deposits may start to 
                look less attractive compared to the potential of recovery 
                stocks.<br>
                <br>
                This is not to say that there are not substantial challenges 
                ahead. The long-term goal of boosting the MSM’s liquidity has 
                been set back somewhat, as it seems likely that companies will 
                postpone initial public offerings (IPOs) until they see a 
                full-fledged recovery, while Western investors face straightened 
                circumstances through 2009. Furthermore, the new capital market 
                fund will have to be very carefully managed. Stocks will need to 
                be assessed for long-term viability, and the future divestment 
                planned to ensure that it does not result in a slide in share 
                values. The MSM is still relatively small, and its development 
                has been arrested by global factors over the past six months. 
                But the Sultanate’s prudent policy making and support for the 
                exchange should see it regain momentum over
                the medium term. </font> <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">

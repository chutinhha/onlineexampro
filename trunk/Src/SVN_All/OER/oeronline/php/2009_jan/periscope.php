            <img border="0" src="peri.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="125" height="148">There are two GCC money market opportunities that I feel could offer 
            a potential 30 per cent return in 2009. First, Oman’s Galfar 
            Engineering and Contracting is attractive at RO0.65, down from its 
            high of RO2.40. This is a blue chip contracting firm whose order 
            book exceeds $2bn, primarily with Oman’s government ministries, 
            Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and Shell.<br>
            <br>
            The Galfar IPO in October 2007 was a spectacular winner, raising 
            more than four times of its offer price on the Muscat Securities 
            Market. However, Galfar shares were devastated by the GCC bear 
            markets, the exit of offshore hedge funds, the plunge in crude oil 
            prices and a third quarter earning miss on lower contract margins. 
            This resulted in a sustained selling, particularly by offshore and 
            margin accounts as Galfar is one of the largest and most liquid 
            shares on the exchange. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Buy into Galfar </b><br>
            However, the Galfar story has actually improved even as its 
            valuation was gutted in the past six months. The Oman government’s 
            revised budget estimates for oil are at $45 and PDO has a strategic 
            commitment to boost oil/gas reserves, so it is not a surprise that 
            Galfar’s order book actually rose to $900mn in 2008. Moreover, the 
            fall in the contract margins will reverse as steel, cement, bitumen, 
            construction equipment and copper prices plunge as a result of the 
            global recession and the Wall Street credit crunch. Meanwhile, 
            Galfar valuations have compressed below 8 times earnings, far below 
            its recent peak. In essence, Galfar is finally a value share for the 
            first time since its flotation. My target range is to buy at RO0.5 
            and sell at RO0.8.<br>
            <br>
            A defensive GCC share is Qatar Telecom (Q-Tel), which has also 
            halved to QR125 on the Doha stock exchange. Q-Tel has done seminal 
            acquisitions such as Wataniya (Kuwait), PT Indosat (Indonesia), 
            Liberty Telecom (the Philippines), Asiacell (Iraq) and Nawras 
            (Oman). Its overall subscriber base totals up to an impressive 56mn. 
            Q-Tel is a growth engine that derives a mere one-third of its 
            revenues from Qatar which makes sense as Qatar is a miniscule market 
            with a teledensity of 125. Moreover, as Vodafone enters Qatar as a 
            second operator, Q-Tel is expected to face tough competition. Q-Tel 
            also derives almost all its revenues from wireless now, making it a 
            true emerging market powerhouse.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Presence in growth markets </b><br>
            Though margins and average revenue per user (ARPU’s) are much lower 
            in Southeast Asia than the Gulf the scale of growth in the former is 
            far higher and this augurs well for Q-Tel.<br>
            <br>
            Q-Tel was trading at a time at a bubble valuation of five times its 
            book value and 18 times its earnings in Doha and Dubai. But this has 
            changed and Q-Tel now trades at a modest 1.3 times book value and 10 
            times earnings despite the fact that it is now a totally different 
            firm. The telecom major is no longer a Qatari telecom monopoly but 
            an emerging market global wireless franchise. I doubt if Q-Tel 
            shares will fall much below its recent bottom of QR110 which if it 
            holds, could be an attractive entry point.</font></p>

            <b>Geographical outlook</b><br>
            I believe Brazil will be one of the best performing emerging markets 
            next year. It trades at a rock bottom forward valuation metric of 
            only 6 times earnings, a 30 per cent discount to Latin America and 
            global emerging markets. Of course, Brazil’s Bovespa is a classic 
            commodities index.<br>
            <br>
            However, Brazil is also ultra-sensitive to a rise in international 
            appetite. This is the reason the Brazilian Real has plunged from 
            1.60 to 2.40 against the dollar. Yet Brazil has some of the highest 
            real rates on the planet, with a SELIC (The SELIC rate is Banco 
            Central do Brasil’s overnight lending rate) money market rate as 
            high as 13.5 per cent. The monetary stimulus by the world’s central 
            banks will push up the commodities market at the same time as China 
            injects a $600bn stimulus to maintain GDP growth in the Middle 
            Kingdom. I believe Brazil will outperform Mexico whose exports are 
            primarily headed to the US and whose remittance revenue from its 
            Diaspora in Texas, Arizona, California and New York will plummet as 
            the American consumer recession bites next year. Brazil has no 
            problem with banks holding toxic CDOs (collateralised debt 
            obligations) and the central bank will surely reduce interest rates 
            to revive GDP growth as domestic inflation falls. I believe it is 
            entirely possible that Brazil offers a total return potential in 
            excess of 30-40 per cent next year as the Bovespa benefits from the 
            biggest synchronised monetary and fiscal stimulus in the history of 
            finance. Moreover, the Brazilian Real is undervalued by at least 20 
            per cent. The best way to benefit from a potential Brazil bounceback 
            is to buy the Brazil Index Fund listed on Amex (symbol EWZ). The 
            Brazil Index Fund has plummeted from 102 to a recent 32, which is an 
            attractive entry point.<br>
            <br>
            Russia has promised to co-ordinate with OPEC because neither Moscow 
            nor the Gulf oil exporters wish to see oil prices fall to $30 or 
            lower. A two million barrel production cut, led by Saudi Arabia, 
            Kuwait and the UAE, is thus highly probable. As interest rates 
            plunge, and credit markets recover from their nuclear winter, oil 
            prices could rise by $10 even if global demand remains sluggish as 
            long as China maintains its GDP growth. This suggests that the 
            Norwegian Kroner is undervalued at 7 against the dollar, which has 
            now fallen 10 full points against the euro. </font></p>

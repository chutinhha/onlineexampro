            In his first media interview, Bruce Hall, CEO of Sohar Aluminium, 
            talks to Jessica Brookes about his plans for the aluminium major

            <img border="0" src="face.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="295"></strong><strong>What is your leadership mantra?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            I think first of all we need to have a clear vision for the 
            organisation that appeals to all stakeholders, and when I say that I 
            mostly think about the employees. The business here is about the 
            employment opportunity for over 1,000 people. We have to start with 
            a vision that allows people to feel part of that – they need to see 
            that their individual efforts, irrespective of what role they play 
            in the organisation contribute to the vision of the company.<br>
            <br>
            The second thing is that people need to have a sense of ownership of 
            the role that they play and the work they do and how this 
            contributes to the business. Accountability is very important for 
            people, and the extension of that is single-point accountability, so 
            it is absolutely clear who is responsible for what.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>What challenges have you faced so far?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            On a personal level the biggest challenge I have got is to find 
            where I can be most effective. I was pleasantly surprised to find 
            that the quality of people that have been working on Phase I here is 
            very good. The team here is superior in its entirety compared to 
            anything I have seen in other smelters. So, as an individual, the 
            challenge is to add value to such a team.<br>
            <br>
            On a more general basis, I think our superior team is not 
            functioning well as a team. I think the challenge that we all face 
            is how to turn ourselves from a team of champions into a champion 
            team.<br>
            <br>
            When it comes to technical issues, the plant hasn’t performed to the 
            level (during the start-up) that one would have expected from such a 
            team. This is unfortunate, especially since the people have worked 
            so hard to make it a success. The main technical challenge is to 
            complete the start-up, which we are aiming to achieve by the end of 
            March. If we can do that I think a lot of people will feel that they 
            have achieved a great milestone. It is a very important 
            psychological milestone in a plant’s life. <br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>What impact has the global financial crisis had on 
            Sohar Aluminium and the industry at large?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            The direct impact for Sohar Aluminium is fairly low. By its nature a 
            new smelter is always going to be a low cost smelter, you can assume 
            that because no one would build a smelter in the first place if it 
            is not going to be cost effective. We are well positioned in terms 
            of the operating costs compared to other older, more mature 
            smelters, which are suffering on account of the current price of 
            aluminium. But for us it is business as usual. If there is any 
            impact at all it may be on the timing of our Phase II expansion, 
            however it is probably a good time to think of building as the cost 
            of construction has dropped dramatically. <br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="face1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="225" height="180">As for the industry in general it is quite a different story. I 
            believe a number of smelters are running at ‘no-profit’. The cost of 
            production for a lot of these operations would be at least as high 
            as the revenue coming from their metal production, if not higher. I 
            think that we are going to see continual closure of capacity. There 
            has already been quite a big closure of capacity in China, which is 
            by far the highest cost producer. With the reduction of consumption 
            of aluminium in China I am sure there is going to be a measured 
            reduction in operating capacity and I think that the jobs of a lot 
            of people are going to be effected. <br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>Rio Tinto Alcan, which own a 20 per cent share of 
            the smelter, has announced they will be cutting 14,000 jobs. Will 
            Sohar Aluminium be impacted? </strong>
            <strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            We may be indirectly impacted because we have a reasonable number of 
            Rio Tinto Alcan employees working here. Some of those are on 
            short-term contracts with us and are due to go back to other 
            projects that Rio Tinto Alcan have in the pipeline. If these job 
            cuts that have been announced are one element of their cost 
            containment, one might presume they are also going to go slow with 
            their capital investments. People may be worried where they will go 
            in the organisation if the projects they were planned to go to are 
            not going to advance as quickly. However, the people we have working 
            here are the cream of Rio’s people. One wouldn’t imagine that the 
            cream of expertise in the aluminium industry would be the ones that 
            would be asked to go. We might find that some of the older smelters, 
            some of the high cost smelters and even some of the smaller Canadian 
            ones might reduce their capacity or go into a closure mode, and 
            therefore the people who are working in those smelters are likely to 
            be part of the 14,000. The other point is that it is yet to be seen 
            that Rio is going to cut these jobs out of the aluminium sector. 
            What I have heard to date is that their biggest exposure is in the 
            mining area. <br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>Are you planning to go ahead with the Phase II 
            potline?<br>
            </strong><strong style="font-weight: 400">We are not looking at that 
            at all at the present moment. At the last board meeting the subject 
            was raised as it inevitably is, and I would imagine shareholders are 
            considering their options in regard to Phase II. As I said earlier, 
            now it is a good time to build, even though it might not seem that 
            way. Based on what I have seen in the eight weeks that I have been 
            in Sohar and on the cost of construction in Phase I, Phase II of 
            this project is an attractive proposition compared to other smelter 
            developments elsewhere.<br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>What are your plans for the year ahead?</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"><br>
            There is a lot of work that has to be done to try and improve the 
            stability of the plant and our technical performance. However, the 
            main focus for me in the next 12 to 18 months will be on training. 
            We are not going to pursue Omanisation just for the joy of it. It 
            has to be done in a controlled and structured fashion. I think it is 
            important for the region’s development to be able to demonstrate 
            that Omanis have the capabilities of acquiring technical knowledge 
            and the operational skills that allow them to be able to run this 
            plant. It is pretty clear that we have not done enough training. We 
            have underestimated the time resources and the human resources that 
            were required to get adequate training. Once we get past the 
            psychological barrier of a start-up, then we can get back to more 
            concentrated and focused training in specific areas. After this, we 
            can start the development phase of staff promotions.<br>
            <br>
            This week we are going to start on our business plan review process 
            which I am hoping will result in a five-year business plan with a 
            strategic plan for achieving the targets. One of the things I am 
            going to be advocating is that a primary function of Sohar Aluminium 
            is to help the people who live in the region to develop, to have a 
            better quality of life, and to give greater opportunities to their 
            kids for education and employment in the future. I think that Sohar 
            Aluminium has a huge opportunity to contribute to the future 
            development of this region and to be the benchmark for bringing new 
            businesses and industries to the region. </strong></font></p>

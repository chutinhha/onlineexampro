                <img border="0" src="retail.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="180">The Middle East, led by Dubai and Abu Dhabi, is witnessing a 
                boom in the retail industry with new shopping malls opening 
                every year. The Dubai Mall, the largest shopping mall in the 
                Middle East and one of the largest in the world opened in 
                November 2008 adding a total of 344,000 sqm of gross leasable 
                area (GLA) to Dubai’s retail sector.<br>
                <br>
                <b>A bird’s eye view</b><br>
                Muscat’s retail sector has only recently caught the attention of 
                investors and retailers and despite having only half the total 
                square meters of GLA that Dubai’s newest mall has, is making 
                headway in expanding and improving the retail space for Muscat 
                residents. In 2007 the Muscat City Centre, completed its 
                RO22.5mn expansion project which more than doubled its GLA, 
                increased its parking space and vehicle access to the mall. In 
                addition to this the eagerly anticipated Qurum City Centre 
                opened its doors to the public.<br>
                <br>
                With increasing household incomes over the past few years, 
                consumer spending among Muscat residents has been on the rise, 
                thereby improving the bottom lines of retailers and creating 
                demand for more shops to be set up in Muscat. In the past few 
                years, it has also been observed that Muscat-based shoppers who 
                used to travel to Dubai for shopping for international brands 
                now make many of their purchases in Muscat. Indeed, in 2008, 
                Muscat City Centre, now home to named brands such as Zara, Gap 
                and Borders, announced that it expects to receive a record 10mn 
                visitors (footfalls) up 25 per cent from the 8mn it received in 
                2007. In light of the above facts (and many more) it is 
                understandable that there are several new retail projects 
                currently in the pipeline for Muscat, including Muscat Grand 
                Mall and Bousher Mall which, when opened in 2010, will make up 
                an estimated 120,000sqm of Muscat’s total GLA.<br>
                <br>
                In addition to bringing new retail shops, new high quality 
                retail developments improve the shopping experience of consumers 
                by forcing existing retailers to improve their offerings. 
                Indeed, Sultan Centre reacted quickly to the entry of Carrefour 
                into its territory by introducing a loyalty programme and 
                renovating parts of its retail space. The new Carrefour is 
                offering a larger variety of quality fruits and vegetables in 
                order to attract Sultan Centre’s customers. Fruits and 
                vegetables has always been an area of strength for Sultan 
                Centre.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Growth drivers </b><br>
                <img border="0" src="retail1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="300" height="145">Like most countries, the demand for retail space in Muscat is 
                driven by increases in the population, consumer spending and 
                consumer tastes and preferences. The growth of the Omani economy 
                has increased the disposable incomes of its residents. The 
                improved purchasing power resulting from higher disposable 
                incomes has increased consumer spending, thereby providing room 
                for the retail industry to grow. An indicator of the increase in 
                consumer spending and the increasing demand for retail space is 
                the fact that the newly opened Qurum City Centre achieved full 
                occupancy in January 2008, ten months before it opened. The 
                taste and preferences of consumers has changed too, many 
                preferring products from international brands, previously 
                unavailable in the country. Consumers are now willing to 
                purchase internationally branded products that are sold at a 
                premium price.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Value driven approach </b><br>
                In order to attract adequate footfalls, a retail development 
                should strategically meet the demands of the consumers. This 
                means that the mall should have a strong anchor store that will 
                guarantee a constant stream of shoppers such as Carrefour and 
                LuLu and a suite of shops that complement the shopping 
                experience of a consumer. The correct mix of retail and 
                entertainment offerings as well as the existence of an anchor 
                store that is a major player in its field is imperative for the 
                success of a retail facility.<br>
                <br>
                For example, despite offering good quality retail space, Markaz 
                Al Bahja has been struggling to attract footfalls. Visitors 
                flock in droves to the nearby Muscat City Centre however, they 
                seem to forget about Markaz Al Bahja. People prefer Muscat City 
                Centre mainly for the complete shopping experience it offers to 
                the shoppers. Families can spend the day doing their house 
                shopping at Carrefour, making personal purchases from clothes to 
                books and gifts, having lunch while their kids play at Magic 
                Planet, and socialising at the many coffee shops in the mall.<br>
                <br>
                Muscat is gearing up for the two new shopping malls which will 
                open in 2010. The existing (and successful) LuLu Hypermarket may 
                well assist in bringing customers to Boushar Mall and though 
                Muscat Grand Mall has yet to announce its anchor store, the 
                associated offices and residences will surely bring customers 
                through their doors. But the key success factor in this case is 
                the volume of buying customers. The two developments are 
                situated adjacent to each other and the sheer size of the two 
                projects (expected GLA of both together is double that of the 
                extended Muscat City Centre) raises some concerns on their early 
                success, especially in view of the current and future short term 
                economy conditions. The ability of these malls to bring in 
                enough customers to survive and make them profitable will be a 
                true test for their management. <br>

                with its general manager, S Venkatachalam for a tête-à-tête <br>
                </b><br>
                <img border="0" src="corp.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="422">The office of National Life &amp; General is a beehive of activity 
                these days. As the company is celebrating 25 years of its 
                operations in Oman it has drawn up big plans for this occasion. 
                Says S Venkatachalam, general manager, “It gives me immense 
                pride to acknowledge that National Life – the first insurer in 
                the Sultanate of Oman is about to complete 25 years in the 
                insurance business. We have a B++ financial strength (good) 
                rating from AM Best Co, the world’s oldest and most 
                authoritative rating agency, and have been certified with ISO 
                9001:2000 by British Standards Institute (BSI).”<br>
                <br>
                <b>Still going strong <br>
                </b>The silver jubilee celebration promises to be good news for 
                customers too. The company is planning to launch a slew of new 
                products to mark the occasion. What gives the company the 
                strength to roll out new products is the loyalty of its 
                customers and the international standards it has been 
                practicing. Besides, as one of the pioneers in the insurance 
                sector the company knows what is hot and what is not in the 
                Sultanate. <br>
                <br>
                Venkatachalam is candid enough to admit that Oman’s insurance 
                sector is complex with a multitude of different firms targeting 
                a particular segment of the market, jostling for market share 
                while navigating a tangle of different rules and regulations. 
                Despite this severe competition, the insurance sector in Oman 
                has been growing at the rate of 18-20 per cent.<br>
                <br>
                National Life is a leader in the life insurance segment in Oman 
                with a market share of 65 per cent. The role played by its 
                product portfolio has been an important contributor to its 
                success in Oman.<br>
                <br>
                The company claims that its product offerings in the life and 
                medical segments are the best in the market. Furthermore, the 
                company has been successful in launching products and services 
                which are tailor-made for the Sultanate’s market. Says 
                Venkatachalam, “We have come a long way in designing products 
                suited to the local market, customising them to fit every strata 
                of society. Over the years, we have strengthened our presence 
                across five fundamental pillars of business – product design, 
                revenue models, operational efficiencies, compliance and best 
                practices and change management.”<br>
                <br>
                Some of the products from the stable of National Life have met 
                with a huge response. The general insurance department, for 
                example, has been a success since its inception two years ago. 
                The money back and savings plus products have met with similar 
                success. The company’s risk-taking ability has been another plus 
                for the company. While others were shying away from the motor 
                insurance sector, National Life entered this segment and reaped 
                rich dividends. The same holds true for its foray into the 
                travel and home insurance segments. While the motor insurance 
                product offerings remain invariably the same across insurers, it 
                is the competitive pricing and claims servicing that 
                differentiates preferred insurers. National Life has invested in 
                technology, operational and process efficiencies and people to 
                strengthen its credibility. <br>
                <br>
                <b>The pricing factor </b><br>
                <img border="0" src="corp1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="297">One of the attractions of National Life products have been their 
                pricing. Says Venkatachalam: “They are reasonably priced and 
                come with a wide coverage. Furthermore, we have a whole new 
                range of products in the pipeline designed specifically for 
                every strata of society, both in life as well as non-life 
                sectors.” <br>
                <br>
                The company offers a vast gamut of products across life and 
                non-life sectors. For individuals it has savings plus, money 
                back, motor, home and travel insurance products. While in the 
                corporate sector it has credit life, group life, fire, marine, 
                and engineering insurance. The company offers the entire range 
                of products for the corporate sector in both domains. Its strong 
                underwriting and reinsurance arrangements help walk that extra 
                mile in customising products specific to each corporate entity.<br>
                <br>
                Currently, in the individual sector, the company has child care 
                savings, education savings, wedding savings, savings plus, money 
                back, term assurance, domestic help and mortgage protection.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Exploring new markets <br>
                </b>The company’s experience with bancassurance has yielded good 
                results. In fact, National Life was the first insurance company 
                to launch such a product in the Sultanate. Says Venkatachalam: 
                “We have indeed hit new milestones in revenues in our 
                bancassurance tie-up with BankMuscat. We are infusing additional 
                resources in the current year to take care of our elaborate 
                expansion plans and are gearing to strengthen our market share 
                by leveraging on ‘service and reach’ as key differentiators in 
                the insurance purchase decision.”<br>
                <br>
                The company’s mortgage protection plan provides parallel and 
                dynamic risk protection with a 24-hour world-wide cover. This 
                plan enables one to set aside small sums of money so that 
                outstanding loans can be paid out. This policy has a reducing 
                sum assured based on the term and sum assured chosen. What that 
                means is that as customer’s debt keeps decreasing, the 
                appropriate sum assured also keeps reducing. This way the plan 
                gives him a dynamic risk protection based on the diminishing 
                risk. By the time he has paid his debts, the risk covered by 
                this plan will cease.<br>
                <br>
                Having proved itself in the Sultanate, National Life has entered 
                the Dubai market. The aim to do so was to make its presence felt 
                in the financial hub of the GCC. Says Venkatachalam: “Our 
                network here will help us push our brand equity to a wider 
                audience, build greater scales and bring to customers a wider 
                choice of products closer to their homes.”<br>
                <br>
                Has the ongoing financial meltdown affected Oman? No, because of 
                good regulators, says Venkatachalam. He adds further: “This is 
                indeed the right opportunity for insurance companies to launch 
                products addressing the increasing demand of investors for an 
                option that will provide them a venue to park their money and 
                secure returns in addition to some insurance protection.” </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><br>

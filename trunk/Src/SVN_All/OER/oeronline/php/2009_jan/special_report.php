                The Arab Gulf leaders would have preferred a better global 
                political and economic environment to hold the two-day long 29th 
                Summit of the Supreme Council of the Arab Gulf Co-operation 
                Council. With Israel’s continuous air strikes on Gaza killing 
                hundreds of civilians and the crude oil prices hovering well 
                below $40 per barrel in the international market, the head of 
                states of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the host 
                Oman couldn’t achieve some of the desired results which were 
                expected from the Summit. <br>
                <br>
                On the positive note, the Supreme Council approved the much 
                anticipated monetary union agreement. An official statement 
                issued at the end of the Summit specified, “The Council also 
                approved the monetary union agreement, which covers the 
                legislative and institutional frameworks. It has also approved 
                the basic statue of the monetary council, calling for quick 
                approval of the agreement, so as to establish the monetary 
                council which will undertake the task of working out the 
                technical requirements for the monetary union, in a bid to 
                establish the Central Bank and launching of the single 
                currency.”<br>

                <br>
                However, the establishment of monetary union is not going to be 
                an easy task even from now onwards. Oman had declared in 2006 
                that it will not be part of the monetary union and there has 
                been no change in its stand on the tactical move, so far. The 
                members of the AGCC will have to ratify the agreement in 2009 
                before the monetary union could become a reality. There are 
                couple of other tricky issues that need to be sorted out. The 
                member states are yet to arrive at an agreement on the location 
                of the central bank. Atleast four states including Saudi Arabia, 
                UAE, Qatar and Bahrain are keen on hosting the central bank 
                according to a statement given by Mohammad Al Mazroui, assistant 
                secretary-general for economic affairs of AGCC to a prominent 
                Dubai-based daily. <br>
                <br>
                Saudi Arabia’s claim on the location of the central bank seems 
                to be the most legitimate one as it is the largest economy 
                (2008: estimated nominal GDP of $480bn) in the region. If we 
                look around, the central bank of European Union is located in 
                Germany, the largest economy of the bloc. But UAE, Qatar and 
                Bahrain’s quest to position themelves as the financial hub of 
                the region will take a beating if Saudi Arabia gets the central 
                bank. <br>

                currency. Though Al Khaliji is speculated to be the name of the 
                new currency but HE Abdul Rahman bin Hamad Al Attiyah, 
                secretary-general of AGCC has categorically stated that no name 
                has been finalised yet and it is expected to be decided in 2009, 
                most probably before the end of the year. The currencies to 
                which the new common currency will be pegged is another highly 
                sensitive issue that needs to be tackled. As of now except 
                Kuwait, all the other five Arab Gulf countries’ currencies are 
                pegged to the US dollar. Kuwait had dropped its dinar peg to the 
                greenback in 2007 in favour of a basket of currencies including 
                the Euro, Yen and British Pound as well. Despite their close 
                relations with the US and the strategic economic compulsions, 
                the Gulf states can’t ignore the fact that the dollar is losing 
                its sheen and they need to reassess their economic interests in 
                a challenging global monetary environment.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
                <b>Way ahead <br>
                </b>The member states have time up to December 2009 to give their 
                nod for the monetary union agreement. Interestingly, the AGCC 
                has a target of introducing the new common currency by January 
                1, 2010. The secretary-general has denied that there has been 
                any change in the launch date. With hardly 12 months to go, it 
                is going to be a daunting task for the AGCC! <br>

                workforce that has spent more than five years in the AGCC

                they have not arrived at any conclusion and the matter is under 
                discussion. Though details of the specific actions taken on many 
                matters are not available but as per the official statement, 
                “The Council has also reviewed the progress made in the AGCC 
                Common Market, approved the market’s document which includes its 
                principles, requirements, objectives and implementation

                the importance for its implementation in a manner that achieves 
                maximum benefit for the AGCC states and citizens. The Supreme 
                Council also discussed the march of economic integration among 
                the AGCC states through the follow-up report submitted to it 
                regarding the work progress made in the Customs Union, the 
                Common Market, the Monetary Union and the long-term

                facilitate movement of the citizens.”
                Yemen which has been knocking on the doors for an entry into the 
                AGCC for long, has been granted membership of the AGCC 
                Standardisation Authority and Gulf Organisation for Industrial 
                Consultancy, the AGCC Auditing Authority and Gulf Radio and TV. 
                It will pave the way for its full membership at a later date.

                The Summit has been hailed as a success by many but some of the 
                industry leaders have a different opinion too. Talking to a 
                Dubai based daily, Sheikh Sultan bin Saud Al Qassimi, chairman 
                of Barjeel Securities said, “The people of the Gulf were looking 
                forward to more concrete results from the GCC Summit which after 
                all only occurs once a year. The monetary union agreement will 
                only come into effect on December 12, 2009, weeks before the 
                expected launch of a single currency which is looking less and 
                less likely. There was no accord on the location of the central 
                bank, the name of the currency or its make-up. The people of the 
                Gulf were expecting a coordinated effort to tackle the effects 
                of the global financial crisis on the region at least but it was 
                not the case either. I think overall it is a very disappointing 
                summit.” <br>
                <br>
                Though Sheikh Sultan may have had extremely high hopes from the 
                Muscat Summit but there is no doubt that the Muscat Summit 
                despite the approval of monetary union agreement has left many 
                questions unanswered! </font> <p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px">

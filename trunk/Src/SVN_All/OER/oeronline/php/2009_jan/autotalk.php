                </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Following in the 
                vein of the Mercedes CLS, while not actually competing against 
                it, is one of the latest entries to the VW stables – the Passat 
                CC. MALCOLM XAVIER CRASTA WRITES<br>

                <img border="0" src="autotalk.jpg" width="350" height="231" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="8">Cars such as these are not classified as sedans but rather as 
                four-door coupés. These are basically sedans with coupé-like 
                proportions that still retain most, if not all, of the 
                practicality of a full size sedan. The first and only car to 
                previously carry this designation was the Rover P5 from 1962 
                until 1973. This design philosophy was only recently revived in 
                the form of the above mentioned Mercedes CLS in 2004. It is now 
                joined by the likes of the Passat CC and soon by the Porsche 
                Panamera and the Aston Martin Rapide.<br>
                <br>
                One look at the exterior of the Passat CC and its distinctive 
                coupé-like design is instantly apparent. Slotted between the 
                regular Passat, whose wheelbase it shares, and the Phaeton in 
                the VW range, the CC is longer, lower and wider than the Passat. 
                Overall it is a very handsome vehicle from practically every 
                angle, apart from maybe the rear. And with its pulled back 
                headlights, 18-inch rims, its wide stance and a low slung roof 
                it looks all the more sporty but has a certain sense of 
                classiness to it. The interior design follows suit with the 
                exteriors sporty theme. The vehicle features sports seats up 
                front, very similar to the seats found in the R32, and two, 
                individually contoured, seats in the rear, which unfortunately 
                makes it strictly a four seater. But think of it as a coupé with 
                two spacious full size rear seats and this is honestly not that 
                big a deal. But, as you may have already guessed, the low roof 
                line does cause headroom problems in the back for anyone close 
                to six feet tall. Also, normally we wouldn’t pay much attention 
                to boot space, unless it was extraordinarily large or vice 
                versa, but in this car it deserves a special mention. Not only 
                does it fit into the former, extraordinarily large, category but 
                it can also be extended by folding down the rear seats. It even 
                has a perfectly rectangular shape with a huge opening making 
                loading and unloading easier. But what truly makes it impressive 
                is that, despite offering such a huge volume, it still provides 
                you with a full size 18-inch spare wheel!<br>
                <br>
                To be honest, it would be unfair to criticise the quality of the 
                few harder materials inside the car. They are not bad by any 
                standards, but just don’t match-up to the high standards of the 
                rest of the car. The leather is soft, the finish is next to 
                flawless and everything looks like it was built to last. But 
                over everything else it is the brushed aluminium finish of the 
                centre console and the polished black surrounds of the console 
                components that stand out the most in contrast with the polished 
                wood accents of the rest of the car. It adds a feeling of class 
                to the interior that is only found in cars that cost a lot more. 
                Behind the wheel, as with most VW’s, the driving position is 
                great with ample adjustments to suit people of all sizes. The 
                2.0l turbocharged inline-four, pulled straight from the GTI, is 
                rated at 197hp and provides more than enough oomph to make sure 
                the CC never feels sluggish. The vehicle also has electronically 
                controlled shock absorbers with three firmness settings. These 
                setting not only firm up the shocks but also the steering, 
                providing better feedback and a firmer ride on its sportiest 
                setting. The ride itself is smooth and relaxing with minimal 
                noise intruding into the cabin, either from the road or the 
                engine. The six-speed auto box is responsive, even in manual 
                mode, with minimal delay when switching gears. About the only 
                thing that we can criticise about is that the steering, although 
                sharp and responsive, could use some more feel and firmness.<br>
                <br>
                As far as features are concerned, the car is packed to the brim 
                with them. The car we drove was a fully specced model and was 
                equipped with a touch screen navigation, dynaudio premium audio 
                system, adaptive headlamps, electric seats and a lot more. It 
                even had VW’s automatic parking system that we saw earlier in 
                the Tiguan. It even has all the regular safety related bells and 
                whistles; all round airbags, ABS, ESP and the like. And you will 
                get all of this for around RO16,000 and, if you want a lower 
                spec model, the basic car is priced at RO14,500. At this price 
                it is hard to fault the CC but at the same time you have to keep 
                in mind that this is strictly a four-seater and the rear 
                headroom isn’t great but apart from this it is a great buy that 
                is worth every rial spent on it. </font></p>

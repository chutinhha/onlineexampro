                <img border="0" src="view.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="102" height="119">South Africa, located at the southern tip of the African 
                continent is an emerging market with an abundant supply of 
                natural resources. The financial, legal and commercial sectors 
                are well developed and it has a stock exchange that is 17th 
                largest in the world. Transport and communication is efficient 
                and modern and supports an efficient distribution of goods to 
                major urban centers throughout the region. The country has a 
                sophisticated modern economy based primarily on three sectors: 
                manufacturing, mining and agriculture. Industrial development 
                has been centered on the largest cities, mainly Johannesburg, 
                Durban and Cape Town.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Business environment</b><br>
                South Africa operates as a free market economy. South African 
                entrepreneurs are generally highly educated, skilled and 
                competitive. In general, a business person would be comfortable 
                and familiar with financial, commercial and industrial standards 
                and customs. The local business culture is predominantly western 
                and the prevalent business language is English.<br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="view1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="203" height="622">Investor confidence in the South African democracy continues to 
                grow. Approximately 75 per cent of South Africa’s economic 
                activity takes place in its four primary metropolitan areas. 
                Gauteng, where most of South Africa’s gold mines are situated, 
                is the financial and industrial centre of the country and 
                accounts for 40 per cent of all economic activity. The inflation 
                rate is currently within the government’s target of three to six 
                per cent. The prime interest rate is currently 12.5 per cent. 
                The major challenge is the volatility of a wildly fluctuating 
                currency.<br>
                <br>
                South Africa’s government is committed to a free-market economy. 
                Government approval is generally not required for foreign 
                investment and the form of foreign investment is virtually 
                unrestricted. The government has specifically recognised the 
                need to attract foreign investment to finance the levels of 
                investment needed for job creation and is continuing with its 
                privatisation initiatives.<br>
                <br>
                Many government development agencies, such as, The Department of 
                Trade and Industry (“DTI”), The Industrial Development 
                Corporation (“IDC”) of South Africa and The Small Business 
                Development Corporation (“SBDC”) provide advice and assistance 
                to further economic development. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Incentive structure <br>
                </b>South Africa welcomes foreign investment and virtually all 
                business sectors are open to investors. No governmental approval 
                is required and there are almost no restrictions on the form or 
                extent of foreign investment. Incentives are largely targeted at 
                manufacturing and key industrial areas. Specific incentives of a 
                varying nature have been created to encourage the development of 
                certain industries.<br>
                <br>
                Exported goods are usually zero-rated for the purposes of 
                value-added tax, and a full input credit is granted on the 
                acquisition of capital and intermediate goods to be used in 
                making VATable supplies. Income tax rates have been 
                progressively reduced and are now competitive in international 
                terms. Under local tax laws, specific tax incentives are aimed 
                at stimulating investment in commercial buildings, machinery and 
                plant
                or equipment. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Structure of business entities <br>
                </b>A number of structures are possible. Private companies, with 
                limited liability, are the most common form of business entity 
                in South Africa. <br>
                <br>
                <b><i>1. Limited Liability Companies</i><br>
                </b>These companies are characterised a restriction on the right to 
                transfer its shares, a limitation on the number of shareholders 
                to a maximum of 50 and a prohibition of a public offering of its 
                shares or debentures. These companies are subject to less 
                stringent rules than public companies. Generally, companies that 
                do not qualify as private companies are considered public 
                companies.<br>
                <br>
                <i><b>2. Close Corporations<br>
                </b></i>A Close corporation is a common form of business entity for 
                smaller businesses. In a close corporation, the members have the 
                rights and obligations of both shareholders and directors. 
                Members of a close corporation enjoy limited liability. <br>
                <br>
                <i><b>3. Partnerships and Sole Traders</b></i><u><br>
                </u>Partnership and sole proprietors are subject to few statutory 
                requirements, but the partners and the proprietors do not have 
                the protection of limited liability. A partnership may not have 
                more than 20 members and registrations are not required. <br>
                <br>
                <i><b>4. Branches of foreign companies<br>
                </b></i>A foreign company that establishes a place of business in South 
                Africa must register as an “external company” within 21 days. 
                The company must appoint a South African resident as the 
                representative of the company. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Structures used by foreign investors </b> <br>
                The form most commonly used by foreign investors is the private 
                company. Annual formalities are minimal, except for the 
                requirements to prepare annual financial statements and to have 
                them audited. Such financial statements are, however, not 
                required to be filed with the Registrar of Companies, and 
                consequently are not available for inspection by the public.<br>
                <br>
                The establishment of a branch of a foreign company should be 
                considered if the company would engage in less than a full 
                operation in South Africa, such as through a representative 
                office.<br>
                <br>
                A company is formed by filing its memorandum of association and 
                articles of association, together with certain specified forms, 
                with the Registrar of Companies in Pretoria. Registration takes 
                approximately three weeks with an additional week for approval 
                of the company name. The cost of forming a company is not 
                significant. No minimum capital requirements are imposed. After 
                a company is established, it must register for certain tax and 
                other purposes. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Tax implications </b> <br>
                The corporate tax is 29 per cent. There is a further secondary 
                tax on companies (“STC”) of 12.5 per cent payable by the company 
                on dividends distributed by that company. The local branch of 
                foreign company is taxed at a rate of 34 per cent. There is no 
                STC on dividends subsequently declared out of these after tax 
                profits. <br>
                <br>
                Where a foreign company has a presence in South Africa, the 
                taxation of its income will depend on the nature of the income 
                derived and whether a Double Tax Agreement (DTA) exists between 
                South Africa and the country of residence of that company. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Withholding taxes <br>
                </b>There is no withholding tax on dividends or on the remittance of 
                after tax branch profits to a foreign head office. 
                Non-residents, not carrying on business in South Africa, who 
                receive royalties or similar payments from South Africa, are 
                subject to a final withholding tax at a rate of 12 per cent. No 
                withholding tax is levied on interest payable to individuals and 
                companies that are not resident.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Individual income tax<br>
                </b>Individual income tax is levied at progressive rates, with a 
                maximum marginal rate of 40 per cent. Advance payments of normal 
                tax are deducted from remuneration payable to employees under 
                the Pay As You Earn (“PAYE”) system.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Other taxes<br>
                </b>The other significant taxes to be considered by the foreign 
                investor include an invoice based VAT, transfer duty, skills 
                development levy, donations tax, stamp duties, customs and 
                excise duties and individual income tax.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Double tax agreement <br>
                </b>The Double Tax Agreement between the Sultanate of Oman and the 
                Republic of South Africa has been in force since 29 December 
                2003.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Labour availability<br>
                </b>South Africa’s labour market has undergone a transformation as 
                the country’s economy moves away from labour-intensive to 
                capital-intensive operations. The labour market is characterised 
                by an oversupply of unskilled workers and a shortage of skilled 
                ones. High population growth constantly exceeds the growth in 
                employment demands. South Africa’s unemployment rate stands at 
                about 24.3 per cent (2007 est.) <br>
                <br>
                <b>Social security <br>
                </b>South Africa does not have a general social security system. 
                Unemployment Insurance Fund (“UIF”) contributions are required 
                to be made for all employees, equally by the employer and the 
                employee (at the rate of one per cent of the employee’s earnings 
                each) up to a threshold of ZAR 139 944 per annum. Employers must 
                make contributions to the Occupational Injuries and Diseases 
                Fund for employees earning up to ZAR 149,136.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Exchange control<br>
                </b>The repatriation of funds from South Africa is governed by the 
                exchange control regulations, implemented through the South 
                African Reserve Bank (SARB) and authorised dealers. For example, 
                the purchase of foreign exchange for imports and the remittance 
                of interest and royalties to a non-resident require approvals. 
                The government has publicly stated its intention to phase out 
                exchange controls over a period of time and has abolished or 
                eased a plethora of control measures.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Import regulations <br>
                </b>South Africa is a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) 
                and follows the Harmonised System (HS) of import classification. 
                Traders are subject to exchange control approval, administered 
                by the SARB. Most goods may be imported into South Africa 
                without restrictions. Import permits are required only for 
                specific categories of goods. In summary, South Africa, as an 
                emerging economy provides a number of opportunities for Omani 
                investors and exporters. <br>

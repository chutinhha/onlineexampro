                casualties of the financial meltdown was the oil price which 
                crashed to abysmal depths. Despite the scare, Oman’s economic 
                outlook is still cheerful, writes Visvas Paul D Karra<br>
                </b><br>
                A Saudi supertanker, Sirius Star, laden with 2 million barrels 
                of oil seized by Somali pirates off the coast of Kenya, on 
                November 15, 2008, made headlines around the world as they 
                demanded around $12mn for its release. The oil in the hijacked 
                tanker, worth about $110mn, was equivalent to a quarter of Saudi 
                Arabia’s daily output. In an altogether unrelated development a 
                month later, OPEC oil ministers agreed their deepest output cut 
                ever on December 16, slashing 2.2 million barrels per day from 
                oil markets to balance supply with rapidly crumbling demand for 
                fuel and stop the oil prices from going south. The move was a 
                bid to build a floor under the oil prices that had dropped more 
                than $100 from a peak of $147 a barrel on July 11, 2008 to 
                $33.36 per barrel on Christmas Eve, the lowest since December 
                2004.</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <br>
                <b>Wild swings</b><br>
                The two developments reflect the fluctuating fortunes of oil – 
                the most prized commodity in the world today since the time 
                mankind tasted the fruit of the industrial revolution thanks to 
                James Watt and his steam engine. At about the same time the 
                Somalian pirates thought they could make some money with the 
                hijacked oil. On land the price chart of the hydrocarbon was 
                hijacked by the lack of demand for energy due to the global 
                credit crunch. As energy demand slowed globally, countries were 
                left holding huge stockpiles of oil. With countries unable to 
                park more oil, investors were forced to sell off at the futures 
                trading.<br>
                <br>
                According to Dr Sohail Issa Magableh, economic advisor, director 
                general of research and development, Capital Market Authority, 
                the fact that so much oil is lying out there in the water (in 
                ships) means there is large excess supply. “Excess supply 
                combined with low consumer confidence because of the global 
                financial crisis led to a weak demand for oil. This means that 
                the prices of oil will continue to remain below $50 for some 
                more time. The continued weakening demand weighed on the market 
                even as oil worth millions of dollars simply languished in huge 
                oil tankers on the high seas for lack of takers pushing the 
                prices further down,” Dr Magableh says.<br>
                <br>
                News of the impending recession in country-after-country has not 
                comforted the oil-producing countries, as their economies depend 
                upon this black gold to keep the state cash registers ringing. 
                For the first time 
                <img border="0" src="macro1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="312">after several years, gloom had descended on 
                friend and foe alike and there was nothing to cheer about in 
                Christmas and New Year. OPEC, which accounts for about 40 per 
                cent of the world’s oil production, reduced the output but the 
                effects of this cut have been marginal as the price of oil 
                continues to remain under the psychological barrier of $50. So 
                what does oil price under $50 per barrel mean for a country like 
                the Sultanate of Oman?<br>
                <br>
                <b>Past prudence helps</b><br>
                Raghavan K Murthi, CEO, United Finance Company, is optimistic in 
                his views and says, “I would watch for three benchmarks – oil 
                being below $40, below $50 and above $65. To me the three stages 
                will mean ‘drawing from accumulated reserves’, ‘having balanced 
                budgets’, and ‘happy days are here again’ respectively. Luckily 
                past prudence will stand us in our stride and I don’t believe 
                that there will be any need to re-look at any development plan 
                even if oil is below $40 for a couple of years.”<br>
                <br>
                But Dr Magableh states that as the global slowdown continues 
                into 2009 and the oil prices continue to remain low, the ability 
                of oil producing countries to create more jobs will be affected 
                and the demand for foreign workers will also decline thus 
                increasing the unemployment rate. Tourism projects will also be 
                hit as the ability to spend on infrastructure gets impacted 
                negatively.<br>
                <br>
                The Gulf countries and other oil producing nations had by now 
                learnt how to adjust their economies to significant fluctuation 
                in oil prices which they witnessed over several decades. 
                According to experts, Oman, for instance, has been building up 
                its reserves over the last few years when oil prices shot up 
                significantly to touch almost $150 per barrel in 2008. This was 
                achieved by 
                <img border="0" src="macro2.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="314">consciously budgeting for oil revenues at levels 
                significantly lower than prevailing market rates and 
                transferring such surplus to the state’s reserves. Oman’s 
                budgets for 2006, 2007 and 2008 were based on oil prices of $32, 
                $40 and $45 respectively – way lower than the prevailing market 
                prices.<br>
                <br>
                The budget deficit could also be higher than in the previous 
                year. This by itself should not cause an undue concern 
                particularly as inflation is now automatically controlled 
                because of the global slow down.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Continue investing</b><br>
                Says Ashok Hariharan, Partner and Head of Tax for Oman and UAE, 
                KPMG, “The price of oil naturally has a great significance for 
                countries like Oman which derive their major income from oil. 
                This is notwithstanding the diversification which Oman has 
                achieved over the last few years in terms of alternative sources 
                of income. The government will, and should, continue to invest 
                in development projects and create a positive climate for the 
                private sector to also continue their planned investments.”<br>
                <br>
                “The price of oil had gone up mainly due to speculators more 
                than anything the actual supply and demand economics. Therefore 
                what you now see is that the demand for oil has been dampened by 
                the global slowdown. But Oman has enough contingency plans if 
                things get worse because the government has enough reserves to 
                tide over this crisis,” says Dr Said Amer Al Riyami, economic 
                expert, at the ministry of commerce and industry. Oman’s fiscal 
                surplus has been 8.4 per cent of the GDP between 2001-2006.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Alternative plans</b><br>
                Meawhile, HE Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, minister of national 
                economy and deputy chairman of the Financial Affairs and Energy 
                Resources Council has declared that the government has drawn up 
                ‘alternative plans’ in case oil prices continue their slide. One 
                of the immediate 
                <img border="0" src="macro3.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="175" height="306">remedial step has been to revise the 2009 
                budget estimates by downgrading it to an assumed price of $45 
                per barrel of oil against the originally decided $55.<br>
                <br>
                In the same breath, Macki said the Omani economy would continue 
                its growth by at least 3 per cent and that the development 
                programmes would go on as usual, but “there will be 
                re-arrangement of priorities.” While claiming the country’s 
                financial and economic condition was “good”, Macki added that 
                the government would implement all approved projects, and there 
                will also be a hedge against any fluctuations resulting from the 
                global financial crisis.<br>
                <br>
                “Some of the alternatives before the government include dipping 
                into the oil reserve fund and postponing certain infrastructure 
                projects while stretching the implementation of the existing 
                projects. The government could also cut down on the subsidies on 
                fuel and electricity in order to tide over the short term 
                decline in flow of investments,” says Dr Riyami.<br>
                <br>
                Murthy observes that Oman has immense unexploited potentials 
                which give options to HE Macki. Mobilising internal savings to 
                fund projects is the number one option. Using stock markets 
                through equity and bonds is another option while inviting global 
                joint venture partners to manage some projects on BOOT basis is 
                feasible. Normal means of borrowing external debts or leaving 
                uncovered deficit are also sustainable choices as Oman’s 
                external debt has gone down from 12.7 per cent in 2000 to 4.4 
                per cent in 2007, according to a WTO report. This is the time to 
                use deficit financing as a means of supporting growth.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Positive climate</b><br>
                <img border="0" src="macro4.jpg" align="right" width="175" height="306">Market analysts also opine that the government will, and should, 
                continue to invest in development projects and create a positive 
                climate for the private sector to continue their planned 
                investments. There will no doubt be a re-look at some of the 
                ambitious projects but the silver lining is the fact that due to 
                the recession in many economies, the prices of not only oil but 
                other commodities have started declining which, hopefully, will 
                reduce the cost of investments.<br>
                <br>
                Oman has always been a prudently managed economy therefore it is 
                very likely that all developmental plans for the next 
                three-to-five years would be looked at again before being put on 
                an implementation course. Macki’s statement that the country 
                would plan for a growth rate of 3 to 5 percent is very positive 
                in the current environment. Further, the current oil prices 
                actually would not impact Oman but would rather impact the 
                economies where the Sultanate has been investing its surplus, as 
                these surpluses may be smaller if at all they are. These testing 
                times also provide an opportunity for governments and the 
                private sector to be more efficient in the way they manage their 
                economies and businesses.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Way ahead<br>
                </b>Oman has a strong economic policy defined in its Vision 2020 
                document and the country is resolutely practicing that. 
                Diversification of sources of revenue, people development, 
                health and education and industrial growth are its strong 
                intents and Oman should continue on that track.<br>
                <br>
                “The brighter side of this alarm bell call is that the nation’s 
                efforts to diversify its revenues beyond oil will get stronger. 
                The support to sectors like tourism, mining, infrastructure like 
                railways/ shipping would get faster and speedier attention. Long 
                term outlook remains unchanged,” Murthy says.<br>
                <br>
                Dr Magableh says that the best way to face the oil and global 
                crisis and find long term protection for a country is by 
                building human capital. This can be done only through sustained 
                efforts and investments in education and health. More vocational 
                training institutes would create a healthy pool of local talent 
                whereas a modern health care industry would lead to more healthy 
                people who can contribute to the diversification process. </font> <p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><font face="Verdana" size="1">

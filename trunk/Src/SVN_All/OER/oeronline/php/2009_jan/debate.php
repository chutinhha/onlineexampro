						<font face="Verdana" size="1">Marketing is perceived as 
                        the task of creating, promoting and delivering goods and 
                        services to consumers and businesses and is thus an 
                        essential part of managing a company. During an economic 
                        slowdown, demand by consumers declines and companies are 
                        faced with higher levels of competition amongst 
                        themselves for this lower demand/sales. Therefore, it is 
                        important to continue to market and promote your 
                        products to at least retain marketshare. The trick is 
                        being close to your target customers and knowing how to 
                        reach them. In today’s modern economies, there are 
                        various marketing tools that can be used. Some of these 
                        tools can be used cleverly but may not necessarily 
                        involve high costs for the company.</font></td>

						<font face="Verdana" size="1">Having a strong brand is 
                        much more important. When you have a strong brand, 
                        people buy your products or services even during the bad 
                        times, because they still want to identify with you. The 
                        reason is mathematical – revenue equals purchasing 
                        frequency multiplied by average purchase price. The 
                        purchasing frequency is higher for strong brand 
                        companies. Secondly, the companies with high brand value 
                        are less pressured to discount their prices during an 
                        economic downturn (in fact, they can even increase 
                        prices since certain segments always have buying power). 
                        This helps them to maintain a higher average purchase 
                        price than competitors. Marketing and promotions are not 
                        decisions based on an economic situation but a function 
                        of the return on investment. <br>

and cut expenses as much as possible. Large companies, however, with deep 
pockets or the ability to access finance may proceed with their expansion plans

                        of multiple divisions and managers. There are two 
                        positive outcomes of a downturn: Firstly, due to lowered 
                        costs you can get more out of your investments.

                        in question. If freebies and discounts works well then 
                        they should do so to enhance sales. Customers will be 
                        shopping for best value and companies while not cutting 
                        prices, could instead offer temporary price promotions. 
                        Other ideas may be to form alliances and network with 
                        partners. Some companies may now focus on customer 
                        retention rather than customer acquisition. It would be 
                        a time to support distributors. In uncertain times, no 
                        one wants to tie up working capital in excess 
                        inventories. Early-buy allowances, extended financing 
                        and generous return policies motivate distributors to 
                        stock your full product line.</font></td>

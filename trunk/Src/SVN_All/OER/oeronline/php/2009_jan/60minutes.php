                the global economy with Mayank Singh </b><br>
                <br>
                <img border="0" src="60min.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="250" height="290">The decoupling of the world from the US did not make any sense, 
                the idea that Germany could do well by exporting to China and 
                vice-versa was a bit far-fetched as it underestimated THE power 
                of the US economy,” says David Bloom, global head of foreign 
                exchange strategy, HSBC Bank. In August 2007, when the US 
                Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates, inflation grew 
                across the globe. This was bandied as proof that the US economy 
                did not matter, evidence that the economic and commodity cycle 
                of the world had completely decoupled from the US. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Co-relation of financial markets <br>
                </b>Says Bloom, “Economies can decouple but financial markets 
                cannot. So even if analysts say that the GCC markets are 
                sheltered from the storm it does not mean that the GCC equity 
                markets are sheltered or that your credit markets or financial 
                conditions are sheltered.” As the sub-prime crisis unfolded in 
                the US, the world moved from decoupling to contagion in August 
                2008. <br>
                <br>
                Curiously, as the meltdown progressed, the dollar strengthened 
                and it seemed, ‘the dollar was enjoying the misery of others’. 
                Over the last few years there was a feeling that the US was 
                slowing and people placed their bets elsewhere. The investment 
                philosophy was to buy into the US market for credit and not for 
                growth. The growth bets were made in Europe and emerging 
                markets. As the crisis grew, investors started unwinding their 
                investments in Europe, impacting the Euro negatively. Investors 
                had bought into high interest rate yielding instruments in the 
                UK, but as interest rates fell to one per cent, people sold 
                heavily.<br>
                <br>
                The volatility in the global economy has made a mockery of every 
                investment logic. “If you are planning to sell Yen and buy the 
                Australian dollar to earn a seven per cent return a year and the 
                currencies move at seven per cent a day, then this no longer 
                makes sense,” says Bloom. Countries which had a big current 
                account deficit and attracted investments by offering high 
                interest rates like the pound sterling, the Australian dollar, 
                New Zealand dollar and lira (Turkey) suffered heavily as 
                investments dried up.<br>
                <br>
                In contrast as companies like Fannie Mai and Freddie Mac 
                collapsed in the US, the government stepped in, guaranteeing 
                their debt. As a result, the paper that was junk immediately 
                became Uncle Sam paper or guaranteed paper. Says Bloom, “Till 
                August 2007, no one wanted to buy US credit but European 
                equities and high interest rate yielding products. Cut to 2008 
                and the scenarios are completely different, you do not want to 
                hold high interest yielding products, you do not want to buy 
                into the global growth story, but you want government guaranteed 
                paper.” Thus people started selling everything except the dollar 
                leading to its rally. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Near future <br>
                <img border="0" src="60min1.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="350" height="206"></b>As governments step in and take on debts there are growing 
                concerns about sovereign risk. “The problem with sovereign risk 
                is the fear that the governments have overextended themselves in 
                order to get a recovery.”<br>
                <br>
                Having said that, the US Fed’s balance sheet has gone up to 
                $3.2trn and President elect Barack Obama is expected to inject a 
                trillion dollars more into the economy. The biggest danger is 
                that if these fiscal measures do not lead to the anticipated 
                recovery then the monetisation of the debt will become an issue. 
                “Ronald Reagan once said ‘governments never solve problems they 
                just rearrange them,’ so what we are doing is that instead of 
                having a deep depression, we are having a recession. The payback 
                of this is that overtime the tax payer will have to pay back the 
                cost burden,” says Bloom. <br>
                <br>
                The Fed fund forecast is zero per cent interest rates, UK rates 
                are falling to one per cent and ECB rates have fallen to 
                two-and-a-half per cent. Ironically, though Central Banks 
                interest rates around the world have plummeted, interest rate 
                for corporate loans have actually risen. This is the result of 
                money becoming expensive, the deteriorating credit situation and 
                the anxieties felt by banks in lending. Says Bloom, “There is a 
                breakdown in financial markets and because counterparties do not 
                trust each other, central banks are being forced to become the 
                lender of last resort and the counter party of first resort.”</font><p align="justify" style="margin: 3px 10px">&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin: 3px 10px">

                <br>
                <b>No quick fix in sight<br>
                </b>When the government let Lehman Brothers collapse people in 
                the financial markets felt that it was the right thing to do. 
                But as bank lending stopped in its trail everyone looked back 
                and said that it was a mistake. Says Bloom, “The problem is that 
                everyday we think we know what the solution is but the next day 
                we find out that it was not the solution.” <br>
                <br>
                The magnitude of the crisis has led to questions being raised 
                about the capitalist system itself. “What is being questioned is 
                the source of markets, if you are a risk-averse person and want 
                to hold cash, then you would ask things like – Which currency 
                should I hold it? Do I have sovereign risk? Which bank is safe? 
                These are things that should be taken for granted and if we 
                cannot take these for granted, then we have a problem in 
                building up the rest of the system,” says Bloom.<br>
                <br>
                The world also seems to be getting caught in a paradox of thrift 
                – the fear of getting caught in an inflationary spiral is 
                slowing consumption and corporate spending. As people save more, 
                consumption goes down further leading to a downward spiral. 
                “Governments are trying to snap this vicious paradox of thrift 
                by making us believe that the money in our pocket is not as 
                valuable, but they are finding it difficult to convince us,” 
                says Bloom. <br>
                <br>
                Despite the pessimistic scenario there is hope that in 
                four-to-five year’s time oil prices will be higher, the fuel 
                price inflation story will remain, there will be a secular 
                uptrend in commodity prices and the growth story will return. “I 
                believe all of that. The journey from here to there is full of 
                hot pot coal, and you have to get through that to get to the 
                other side. So 2008 will be an important year in changing the 
                structure of the global economy” says Bloom. </font><p align="right" style="margin: 3px 10px"><br>

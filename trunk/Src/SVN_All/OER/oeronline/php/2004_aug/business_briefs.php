<br>
<img border="0" src="im40.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="150" height="136">The domestic macro-economic environment
of the Sultanate has
improved considerably in 2003 as
reflected in higher estimated
growth in GDP, modest decline in
prices, easy liquidity condition, surpluses
in the fiscal and current
account positions, higher foreign
exchange reserves and notable
increase in employment, in both
public and private sectors.
<br>
<br>
The Central Bank of Oman, in its
annual report for the year 2003, gave a comprehensive review of the domestic
economic developments in the recent period with particular reference to 2003. 
With
high oil prices, comfortable balance of payment, fiscal, liquidity and foreign
exchange reserves positions, the outlook for 2004 also looks positive, the 
report said.
<br>
<br>
Given the predominant role played by the oil sector in shaping the course of
the economy, despite the decline witnessed in oil production in recent years, 
the
economy remained vibrant owing to increase in average prices for Omani crude
from $24.29 in 2002 to $27.84 in 2003, the annual report said.<br>
<br>
While oil exports increased by 4.4 per cent in 2003, net oil revenues of the 
government
rose by 5.3 per cent, and value added by the petroleum sector at current
prices also moved up by 6.5 per cent. Stronger contribution of the oil sector 
helped
in lubricating the non-oil sectors, which was manifested in appreciable growth 
in
non-oil exports, non-oil fiscal revenues and value addition in the non-petroleum
sectors. Oman's gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices is estimated to
have increased by 6.3 per cent in 2003, as against 1.8 per cent in 2002.

for Batinah <br>
                    </b><br>
His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said has
issued directives to implement several
development projects worth RO15.2
million in the wilayats of the Batinah
region. The statement was made by HE
Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, minister
of national economy and deputy chairman
of the Financial Affairs and Energy
Resources Council. This grant for the
Batinah region is in addition to the
amount endorsed in the sixth five-year
plan (2001-2005).
<br>
                    <br>
                    The money provided will be used to
enhance services in fields such as education,
infrastructure, housing, health,
electricity and water sectors. This amount
was granted for the further development
of the Batinah region after the initial
results of the population census
2003 came out, which highlighted the
population density in the region and its
economic and strategic importance.
<br>
                    <br>
                    It was due to the surge in oil prices
that the government implemented a
number of road, health, educational and
social projects during the sixth five-year
plan at a total cost of RO743.1 million.
The original allocation for this plan was
RO1,690.8 million and the total amount
allotted for the plan is RO2,433.9 million.
This amount excludes the royal
grant, the minister revealed.

out a survey of 123 countries. CATO ranked Hong

third position.
<br>
<br>
This economic survey is based on five variables which
determine the economic freedom in a country. These five
categories include the size of government, which is determined
in part by spending taxes, the legal structure and
security of property rights, access to sound money that is
not weakened by high inflation rates, the freedom to
exchange goods and services with foreigners and the
degree to which business and credit and labour markets

            </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">O</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">ver 
            the past few years, Bahrain witnessed a boom in land values in prime 
            locations. The positive reforms being made by the government of 
            Bahrain towards developing a strong economy and infrastructure have 
            attracted many foreign and GCC investors to the Island's property 
            market. The island kingdom has seen its property market boom with an 
            average of about $41 million to $44 million (RO15.77-16.92 million) 
            worth of property changing hands every month. The government has 
            supported the sector by attracting investors through an open-door 
            policy while also planning to spend approximately BD320 million 
            (RO326.84 million) over the next decade to create world-class roads 
            and flyovers to improve traffic in key areas, measures that will 
            further enhance the property market.<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="im12.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" width="186" height="138">The country also enjoys a lucrative property rental market as 
            expatriates make up a significant portion of the population. The 
            American military's presence has also spurred demand growth and 
            development in specific locations and styles of housing. Statistics 
            show that the value of real estate transactions in Bahrain rose by 
            around 50 per cent in 2002 to reach BD176.8 million (RO180.58 
            million) as against BD118.8 million (RO121.34 million) in 2001. A 
            total of 11,163 transactions were conducted during the year. <br>
            <br>
            The figures indicated hectic activity in the construction and real 
            estate sector in Bahrain. Real estate and construction sector has 
            been contributing increasingly to the GDP of the country and it 
            contributed BD400.9 million (RO409.47 million) or 12.7 per cent of 
            GDP in 2002 as compared to 11.7 per cent in 2000. <br>
            <br>
            The rapidly growing real estate sector in Bahrain has created 
            multi-million dollar investment opportunities for the local, 
            regional and international investors. For example, an island 
            development project by Oasis Property Developers has already sold 
            over 50 per cent of its 2.79 million sq. mt property. Amwaj Island 
            project, which is aimed at reclaiming submerged land north east of 
            Bahrain's Muharraq Island and transforming it into a leisure resort, 
            has received an encouraging response from the investment community.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bahrain has planned for the future economic growth with other 
            projects such as the Al Dana Resort, Durrat Al Bahrain, the 
            Bahrain-Qatar causeway, the expansion work for the international 
            airport, Shaikh Khalifa port, Shaikh Hamad causeway, the F1 
            international circuit, major hotel developments, and the ambitious 
            Bahrain Financial Harbour project. The construction of shopping 
            malls has also contributed to a surge of demand and the entire 
            commercial district has witnessed increased interest especially from 
            GCC investors.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Overall, the property market in Bahrain is still opening up and 
            getting ready for a larger boom on account of projects such as the 
            construction of island resorts and other tourism related real estate 
            developments such as the development of the Formula 1 race track. 
            Bahrain's real estate laws are clearly drafted and defined, making 
            investors confident about acquiring real estate in the Kingdom. <br>
            <br>
            Low interest rates, higher liquidity in the region due to higher oil 
            prices and increasing number of building permits are further 
            expected to contribute to the development of the real estate sector 
            in the near future. Even though the construction and real estate 
            sector is booming, there has not been a strong demand from the 
            sector for bank borrowing. In recent years, the commercial bank 
            lending to the real estate and construction sector hovers around 
            10-11 per cent of the total lending by the commercial banks in 
            Bahrain. It declined to BD152.5mn or 8.7 per cent in the third 
            quarter of 2003. The increased liquidity in the region seems to be 
            finding its way into the real estate and construction sector. <br>
            <br>
            The year 2002 experienced one of the highest number of construction 
            permits issued by the government as it rose by 124.7 per cent to 
            8,636 over 2001. In the first three quarters of 2003, the government 
            issued even higher construction permits totalling 7,036 as the end 
            of war in the region further improved sentiments in the second and 
            third quarter. As per the data available from the land registry 
            directorate of Bahrain, there has been a consistent rise in real 
            estate transactions since the past few years. Because of the lack of 
            high yielding investment instruments, excess liquidity, and overall 
            political stability, the real estate market grew to $615.4 million 
            (RO236.69 million) in the first quarter of 2003, as compared to 
            $468.9 million (RO180.35 million) in 2000. <br>
            <br>
            Despite the increasing activities in the real estate sector, there 
            exists extreme shortage of housing in Bahrain especially in the low 
            to medium income family range. The number of total applicants to the 
            Ministry of Housing outnumbers the number of loans given by the 
            housing bank in Bahrain. In 2001, around 6,500 applications were 
            received by the Ministry of Housing while around 2,300 were given 
            loan by the housing bank. The figures confirmed that there is a 
            demand for residential houses in Bahrain and there remains a huge 
            gap that needs to be filled. As a result, the Cabinet approved an 
            additional support of BD12 million (RO12.26 million) to the Housing 
            Bank.

            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">The government of Bahrain has enacted various laws to give further 
            fillip to the bourgeoning real estate market. Bahrain has now opened 
            its doors for a permanent resident permit in Bahrain for as long as 
            the person remains the owner of the property, and he may sell the 
            property at any time afterwards to another foreign passport holder, 
            but in that case his resident permit will be terminated along with 
            the sale of the property. In recent times, laws have been enacted 
            pertaining to property ownership that are designed to attract 
            foreign investments into the country. Foreign investment is seen as 
            an important element towards achieving economic diversification and 
            sustaining growth. <br>
            <br>
            Laws have been passed allowing nationals from other GCC countries to 
            own property in Bahrain. Another decree was passed recently allowing 
            foreigners to own property in areas designated by the government.
            <br>
            <br>
            This law sets out areas where non-Bahrainis can own land, property 
            and the type of property. Bahrain has witnessed high demand for 
            residential property from people working in Saudi Arabia who are 
            based in Bahrain. In its quest to establish the island Kingdom as 
            the regional 'family tourism' centre, the Bahraini government is 
            offering permanent residence to expatriates who buy real estate in 
            one of the new development projects.<br>
            <br>
            For example, an expatriate who buys a villa in the Durrat Al Bahrain 
            or Al Marsa Floating City will get a residence permit that will be 
            renewed every ten years. Also, expatriates who hold a valid 
            residence permit in another GCC state and occupy senior positions 
            with their companies can move their families to Bahrain and continue 
            working in the other Gulf country, according to a plan introduced 
            recently by the government. The property market in Bahrain is set to 
            grow exponentially in view of the number of high profile projects in 
            the pipeline coupled with increasing foreign investment, excess 
            liquidity and government's liberal policies towards non-Bahrainis to 
            own property in the country.

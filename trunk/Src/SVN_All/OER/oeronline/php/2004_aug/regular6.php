            <img border="0" src="im54.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="193">In a plan to further strengthen its mobile phone leadership 
            position, Samsung Electronics, the world leader in digital 
            technology, has launched its latest D100A mobile phone in Middle 
            East. Especially targeted towards the upwardly mobile professional 
            community, the SGH-D100A is equipped with versatile business 
            functions, such as an email client, vCard, vCalendar, voice memo and 
            multi-party call system. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The SGH-D100A mobile phone has opened unprecedented vistas for 
            Samsung in the business mobile phone category,&quot; said Ramdas Rajamani, 
            sales and marketing manager, Samsung Gulf Electronics. &quot;The business 
            phone, we anticipate, will become indispensable to the busy 
            executives, as it is designed to meet their communication 
            requirements and conduct business effortlessly in real-time.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Weighing 90.8g, the SGH-D100A provides advanced email client 
            services to receive and send from the mail server of selected e-mail 
            accounts by using POP3, SMTP and IMAP4 technologies. This phone has 
            a total capacity of 1MB for sending and receiving emails and is 
            equipped with a tri-band mode to support GSM900MHz, DCS1800MHz and 
            PCS1900MHz simultaneously. Furthermore, the phone has an Organic 
            Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) external screen, which produces a 
            display capable of more vivid colour than any other display, and 
            features greater battery durability because of its efficient power 
            usage. The ability to minimise the screen's reflection or distortion 
            at different angles is another advantage of the OLED. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;The email client function provides a more flexible and efficient 
            work environment, giving professionals real-time mail access from 
            any place, whereas, the tri-band mode facilitates seamless 
            international roaming services for business travellers. Furthermore, 
            the phone's OLED external screen represents the next huge 
            breakthrough in the display revolution,&quot; Ramdas added. </font></p>

            <br>
            <img border="0" src="im53.jpg" align="left" width="175" height="193">Global 
            and regional digital leader LG Electronics has set a new benchmark 
            in regional innovation with the launch of its new mobile handset, 
            the F7100 Qiblah phone. The new handset is the world's first to 
            feature an indicator setting which points to Mecca. The Qiblah 
            indicator uses an inbuilt longitude and latitude orientation or city 
            references that, when used in comparison to the magnetic north, 
            indicates the direction of the Qiblah. The phone comes complete with 
            a compass and prayer time alarm functions. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;No matter where the faithful are at the call to prayer, they will 
            be able to easily identify the direction of Mecca with this phone. 
            As a global and regional digital leader, LG is committed to setting 
            the standards for state-of-the-art solutions and providing our 
            customers with products of the highest quality. Currently, mobile 
            phones are taking to the mainstream by catering to local 
            geographical and cultural demands. The unveiling of the compass 
            mobile phone at this time is part of such strategy to meet customer 
            needs,&quot; said Kenn Suh, executive vice president, Telecommunication 
            and Hand Set Division, LG Electronics. <br>
            <br>
            Other rich features of the phone include Java applications support, 
            answering machine, GPRS, 40-tone polyphonic ring tones, MMS, EMS, 
            personal organiser featuring calendar, clock, alarm, world time, 
            currency converter, calculator, phone book (up to 250 entries) and 
            games. It weighs just 89 grams, and the Li-polymer battery has up to 
            3.5 hours talk time, and standby time of up to 200 hours. With the 
            innovative slide down keypad, users can enjoy two functions of 
            display. The screen can be enlarged when the keypad is pulled down 
            and has 65,000-colour display of high-resolution pictures. </font>

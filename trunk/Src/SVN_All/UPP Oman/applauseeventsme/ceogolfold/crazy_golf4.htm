                    Golf was banned in Scotland, as people were more obsessed 
                    with golf than with acquiring military skills during an 
                    English invasion in the middle of the 15th Century.<br>
                    <br>
                    Scotland is the home of the world's oldest golf course, 
                    St. Andrews, which was used as early as the 16th century.<br>
                    <br>
                    The first golf car was invented in the late 1940s strictly 
                    for people with disabilities.<br>
                    <br>
                    The dimples on a golf ball help it to move larger 
                    distances by at least 350% as compared to a smooth ball by 
                    reducing drag force.<br>
                    <br>
                    Golf was banned in 1457 by King James II of Scotland who 
                    felt it was distracting young men from archery practice<br>
                    <br>
                    The medieval Dutch word &quot;kolf&quot; or &quot;kolve&quot; meant &quot;club.&quot; It 
                    is believed that word passed to the Scots, whose old Scots 
                    dialect transformed the word into &quot;golve,&quot; &quot;gowl&quot; or &quot;gouf.&quot; 
                    By the 16th Century, the word &quot;golf&quot; had emerged.<br>
                    <br>
                    The word ‘golf’ takes its origin from the medieval Dutch 
                    word ‘kolf’ or ‘kolve’ which meant club. <br>
                    <br>
                    Which came first, the birdie or the eagle? The birdie, and 
                    the eagle followed and continued the feathered theme. <br>
                    <br>
                    In American slang of the 19th Century, the term &quot;bird&quot; was 
                    applied to anything particularly great. &quot;Bird&quot; was the 
                    &quot;cool&quot; of the 1800s in the U.S.So on the golf course, a 
                    great shot - one that led to an under-par score - came to be 
                    known as a &quot;bird,&quot; which was then transformed into &quot;birdie.&quot; 
                    The term birdie was in worldwide use by the 1910s, and it's 
                    believed it debuted in the U.S. in 1899. An &quot;eagle&quot; simply 
                    followed &quot;birdie,&quot; being added to the lexicon in keeping 
                    with the avian image of birdie. And &quot;albatross&quot; later came 
                    along for the same reason. Source: USGA Museum.</font><p align="right" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 4px">

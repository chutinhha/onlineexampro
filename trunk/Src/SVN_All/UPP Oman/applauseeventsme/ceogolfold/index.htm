      beginners alike. <br>

      Over 70 golfers then teed off instyle for the Champions trophy and 
      Champions Rolex to a signal which echoed amongst the dunes from the Dodge 
      Durango awaiting the player who could shoot a hole-in-one. The golfers 
      played in either an 18-hole Stable Ford format or a 9-hole Stable Ford 
      Format tournament. An exciting highlight on the Course was Hole No. 2,

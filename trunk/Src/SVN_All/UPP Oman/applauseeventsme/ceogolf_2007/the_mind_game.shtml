            The 
            Business Golf <a name="top">Experience</a><br>
			</b><br>
            It is said that there are two kinds of people in the corporate 
            world: those who play Golf and those want to. <br>
            <br>
            Business Golfing is one of the world’s leading corporate pastimes. 
            It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, more than $28 billion in 
            annual sales result directly from contacts, conversations, and 
            relationships initiated or conducted while learning or playing golf.<br>
            <br>
            Business Golfing is a high-profile mental game where the world’s top 
            most CEOs and corporate honchos play a round of golf while making 
            strategic moves that make or break business fortunes. <br>
            <br>
            Exclusive Business Golfing events such as OER CEO Golf 2006 are 
            ideal venues where new doors open or deals are closed. High-profile 
            networking bees meet and connect with prospective clients and 
            business associates on the greens. They share valuable business 
            intelligence and insights while showing-off their big swings and 
            power drives.<br>
            <br>
            Golf is an effective tool for team building and networking as it 
            provides a shared experience between the participants. A four to 
            five hour round of Golf with a client or associate strengthens a 
            relationship, and that can be the way forward for your business.<br>
            <br>
            Golf is an effective way to create and maintain relationships – 
            relationships that can improve your business. OER CEO Golf 2006 will 
            enable Corporate Oman’s top drivers to sharpen both their business 
            and golf skills.<br>
            <br>
            Business golf is not just for &quot;expert&quot; golfers. It is a common 
            misconception that only competent and experienced golfers can use 
            golf for business advantage. While golfers who know how to play the 
            game fairly well practice the majority of business golf, there has 
            been a trend towards all levels of players conducting business on 
            the course. </font>

			THE 
            <a name="top">EQUIPMENT</a> </b><br>
            <br>
            A golf set is the next most important thing that is required if you 
            wish to play golf. A set comprises of various clubs which is kept in 
            a golf bag. Rules of golf allow for only 14 clubs in the bag while 
            playing a round. The following clubs are required:<br>
            <br>
            Driver: Also called 1-wood. Has a solid base and can send the ball 
            miles if hit properly.<br>
            <br>
            Woods: The other woods are 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- and 7-wood. These are 
            called fairway woods because they are mostly used to hit the ball 
            from the fairway. Though, depending on the distance you want the 
            ball to cover, you can use them from the tee area as well. Of the 
            above mentioned woods, a 3-wood will travel much farther than a 
            7-wood.<br>
            <br>
            Irons: Starting from 1-iron to 9-iron. The head of these clubs has 
            various degrees of loft which can send the ball higher into the air, 
            or lower. Laws of physics state that higher the degree of 
            trajectory, lower the distance travelled. Thus a 1-iron, with the 
            lowest loft, will generally send the ball around 240 yards, while a 
            9-iron will go to about 160 yards for a good player.<br>
            <br>
            Wedges: These have even more loft than a 9-iron and are required for 
            special shots. A sandwedge helps you come out of the bunker. A 
            pitching wedge is required when you have about 100-130 yards from 
            the cup. A lob wedge is required when you want the ball to land 
            softly and not travel much distance after landing.<br>
            <br>
            Putter: Has a flat head and is required on the green to roll the 
            ball into the cup.<br>
            Of course, the other thing that you will require is that small 
            dimpled marvel called the golf ball. If you are just starting golf, 
            make sure you carry more than one ball to the course, because you 
            will surely lose some during your first few rounds.<br>
            <br>
            Also required is a caddie to carry your bag and give you expert 
            advice, since he spends most of his time on the course, on what line 
            to take when you are putting.</font><p align="right" dir="ltr">

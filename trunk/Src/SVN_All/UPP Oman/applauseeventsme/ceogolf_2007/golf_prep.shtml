			Golf 
            <a name="top">Prep</a></b><br>
            <br>
            Before you take that first swing with a golf club, there are some 
            things you need to know. Although swinging a golf club may look 
            simple enough, the mechanics that make a golf swing work involve 
            several major muscle groups working together. Some critical areas 
            and muscles involved in the swing include the back, the shoulders, 
            the hips and legs. Stretching and strengthening these groups is very 
            important prior to playing golf. The golf swing is an unnatural 
            movement, and proper stretching and preparation will help to avoid 
            injury. <br>
            <br>
            Each of these muscle groups is important, but most important of 
            these is the back. Since most golf injuries occur to the lower back 
            region, we'll focus there for now. A golf swing requires twisting of 
            the torso, and can apply pressure and stress to the upper and lower 
            back. As a player addresses the ball, proper flex in the knees can 
            alleviate some of this stress, but not all. At address, the lower 
            back muscles support the upper torso weight as it is angled forward 
            to the ball. As the club is taken away to top position, the back 
            twists, and is still responsible for holding the head and shoulders 
            steady and upright. <br>
            <br>
            As the swing proceeds downward, and then into the follow-thru, the 
            arms transition around the torso, causing the back to twist in the 
            opposite direction. This unusual motion can cause strain to an 
            unprepared lower back. The golf swing can generate club head speeds 
            in excess of 100 miles per hour. It's this speed, power, and 
            momentum that a player must understand and be prepared for. The key 
            is to stretch, strengthen, and condition these muscle groups to 
            avoid injury. So before you dig into that large bucket of range 
            balls, take your time and sufficiently stretch out those muscles, 
            especially the back! Consult your local Golf Pro for exercises you 
            can do to prepare your body for the game of golf. </font>

            <i>Eldrick T. &quot;Tiger&quot; Woods (born December 30, 1975, in Cypress, 
            California) is an American golfer widely considered to be one of the 
            greatest golfers of all time. In 2005, at the age of 29, he won his 
            tenth major golf championship, placing him third on the all-time 
            list behind Jack Nicklaus and Walter Hagen. He has won more times on 
            the PGA Tour than any other active golfer. </i><br>

            How to Master the Mind - Winning Psychology</b><br>
            <br>
            The true essence of golf is capitalizing on opportunities and 
            minimizing mistakes. It is a thinking man's <br>
            (or woman's) game to a 
            great degree. I believe that my creative mind is my greatest weapon. 
            The best way to describe it is a kind of inner vision that enables 
            me to see things others might not, like a certain way to play a shot 
            or a slight opening in a thicket. And I've been blessed with the 
            physical ability to execute whatever shot my mind dictates. Your 
            creative mind should be your greatest weapon, too. While managing 
            your game, you should be constantly assessing situations, factoring 
            in variables like changing course conditions and deciding on whether 
            or not to play the percentages. The psychology of golf goes a step 
            further than course management. It entails mental toughness, 
            self-confidence, intimidation, gamesmanship, conquering inner 
            demons, instant recall of past successes and being able to quickly 
            purge failures. It is the game within the game. <br>
            <br>
            Guys like Freddie Couples and Ernie Els are so easygoing you'd never 
            know from their demeanor what they're thinking. Others, like me, are 
            more emotional and demonstrative. What we have in common is a 
            competitive spirit that drives us to perform to the best of our 
            abilities and an understanding that sometimes our best isn't good 
            enough. Truth is we fail more often than we succeed. You let those 
            failures get to you, because they will erode your confidence and 
            chip away at your psyche. Pretty soon those inner demons will have 
            you second-guessing everything from your swing to putting stroke to 
            the color of socks you're wearing.<br>
            <br>
            I'm asked all the time about my ability to focus and stay in the 
            moment when the pressure is on. It's simple. I realize that the only 
            thing I can control is my game. That is my only security blanket in 
            a game where you could easily feel naked to the world. I can’t count 
            on controlling what the other player is going to do because most 
            top-level players are concentrating on their own games. Sometimes 
            you win tournaments, other times they are given to you. The key is 
            to consistently put yourself in position to win. That’s the only way 
            to get used to the pressure, so when you’re faced with a must make 
            putt, you know the feelings that go along with it. More important, 
            you know how to deal with them. Control yourself and you control 
            your destiny. </font>

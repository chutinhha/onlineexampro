            ETIQUETTE 101</b><br>
            <br>
            Golf etiquette involves the way a golfer treats other golfers as 
            well as the golf course. As Arnold Palmer put it: &quot;Golf resembles 
            life in so many ways. Golf, more than any game on earth, depends on 
            simple, timeless principles of courtesy and respect.&quot; <br>
            <b><br>
            Safety First:</b><br>
            Before you hit the ball, make sure there is no one in the way. This 
            means, no one is around you and there is no one in the path where 
            your ball is going. This sounds pretty simple, but it's a known fact 
            that a perfect drive at the driving range from the day before, can 
            suddenly turn into a bad slice once there are two or more people 
            watching. If you think your ball is going to hit someone, it is 
            common courtesy to give a good yell and let that person know its 
            coming. <br>
            <b><br>
            Quiet Please:</b><br>
            Shhhhh! It is common courtesy to be quiet and still when another 
            player is hitting. It's amazing how many of your friends will forget 
            this rule, and think of creative nicknames to call you while you are 
            in mid-swing. This can happen frequently when a small wager is 
            involved with the game. <br>
            <b><br>
            In the Sand:</b><br>
            It happens to everyone sooner or later. What appears to be a perfect 
            drive heads straight for the sand trap. Now what? Well, you've got 
            to jump in and take your shot. After you've hit your ball from the 
            sand trap (or bunker), it is common etiquette to pick up one of 
            those little rakes around the side and smooth out the sand. Also, it 
            is courteous to leave the rake on the side of the sand trap so the 
            next hapless golfer will be able to get to it. <br>
            <b><br>
            Repairing Divots:</b><br>
            It is important to repair your divots every time you take a chunk 
            out of the course. There are special little tools, called 
            appropriately, &quot;Divot Repair Tools&quot; which help you put the grass 
            back more closely to it's original condition. This also applies to 
            ball-marks on the putting green. When your ball lands on the green, 
            take some time to smooth out the ball mark where the ball landed. It 
            is considered poor etiquette to take out large chunks of grass while 
            taking practice swings on the tee, and even poorer etiquette to take 
            out large chunks of grass out from the putting green. <br>
            <b><br>
            On the Green:</b><br>
            The putting green is somewhat sacrosanct territory for a golfer. If 
            you have your bag of clubs with you, leave them off to the side of 
            the fringe, but never lay them directly on the green. Also, when 
            you're on the putting green, be careful not to walk across another 
            player's lines. A player's &quot;line&quot; is the line between their ball and 
            the hole. If your ball is in the way of another player's putt, it is 
            common courtesy to mark you ball with a coin or ball marker so as 
            not to interfere with the other player's putt. While on the green, 
            be careful not to damage the green with your club, the flagstick or 
            your golf spikes. Well, so far, we've covered some of the basics of 
            golf etiquette. You're ready to go hit the links.&nbsp; <br>

                      According to Mr. Sandeep Sehgal, General Manager, United

                      wonderful platform for the corporate houses in Oman to 
                      come together and compete on a different kind of turf. It 
                      provided an opportunity for teams to try their skills at 
                      games of body and mind. All in all it has been an 
                      experience to remember. The tremendous success of this 
                      event can be attributed to the unstinting support received 
                      from key corporate houses especially Oman Mobile and Jeep. 
                      Our vision is to see this event go from strength to 
                      strength with each passing year.”<br>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p style="color: #893608;">
                    The 2014 Edition of OMAN FORUM will be organized on 20 October (Monday) at Majan Ballroom, Ritz-Carlton Al Bustan Palace, Muscat. Over 300 strong audience drawn from the relevant ministries and the senior-and-middle level leadership of private sector companies with a combined market capital of over $30 billion are going to attend OMAN FORUM 2014. The half-day event will comprise two panel discussions on two important socio-economic subjects which are of immense national interest.
                </p>
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">PANEL DISCUSSION 1: JOB CREATION – THE NATIONAL AGENDA</h3>
                <p style="color: #893608;">
                    The policy changes and various programmes of the government have led to an increase in the employment of Omanis in the private sector in the recent years. Does it mean the changes have led to the desired result? Not really, if we go by the employment figures recently released by National Center for Statistics and Information (NSCI). The number of Omanis employed in the private sector had grown to 181,964, by end of November 2013. It indicates a growth of 5.76 per cent compared to December 2012 figures of 172,066. On the other hand, the 
number of expatriate workers in the private sector by November 2013 was pegged at 1,527,102. The figure was 1,316,182 by end of 2012. It indicates a growth of over 16 per cent on an annualized basis. In the period when Omani private sector companies hired 9,898 Omanis, they also hired 210,920 expatriates. The private sector hired 20 expatriate workers for every Omani hired by them, in roughly the same period. Instead of slowing down, the process of hiring of expatriates has accelerated. If we look back, the expat workforce increased by almost 10 per cent in 2012 over 2011. Overall, the private sector has added over 412,000 additional expatriate workers (over 37 per cent) in the last two years compared to 2011 figures. Under this backdrop, Oman Forum would debate on the following points:
			<ul class="small-blist style">
                <li>Explore the progress made in the last two years in job creation and employment of Omanis in the private sector.</li>
                <li>Review the Government’s policy and the performance of the programmes in this direction.</li>
                <li>Is the nation on track to meet the objective of having Omanis comprising two-third of the overall workforce as stated by His Majesty?</li>
                <li>The socio-economic ramifications of the gap between over 50,000 Omanis coming out of school/colleges every year against only 10,000 Omanis joining/getting the job opportunity annually in the private sector.</li>
            </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">PANEL DISCUSSION 2: OMAN’ MARCH ON ISLAMIC FINANCE</h3>
                <p style="color: #893608;">
                    The year 2013 has been a watershed in the banking and finance industry of Oman. With the launch of full-fledged Islamic banks and the introduction of Islamic windows by the conventional banks in 2013, a new segment of banking and finance has been created in the Sultanate. The corporate community and the society-at-large had high expectations from the Islamic financial institutions in Oman. Have they been met? On the other hand, the Islamic financial institutions were quite excited and buoyed by the initial market studies that had indicated a great start for them. Are they satisfied with the response they have received in the market? The second panel discussion in Oman Forum would seek answers to these questions apart from discussing on the following points:
			<ul class="small-blist style">
                <li>Salient features of the first year of Islamic finance in Oman.</li>
                <li>What have been the challenges in the roll-out of Islamic finance?</li>
                <li>Is there a gap between the customers’ expectations and the offerings of the Islamic financial institutions?</li>
                <li>What has been the feedback of the corporate and retail customers?</li>
                <li>How Islamic finance is providing a better alternative to the customers’ financial products’ needs?</li>
                <li>What role is it playing in promoting the SMEs sector?</li>
                <li>Is there a need to revisit the regulatory framework to ensure a better environment for Islamic finance to grow in Oman?</li>
            </ul>
                </p>

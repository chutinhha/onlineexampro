                <font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt"><b>POLLUTION</b><br>
                Worldwide, rainforests are disappearing at a rate of one and a 
                half football fields per second. Each spring the forests breathe 
                in oxygen and the earth breathes out again the following autumn, 
                but like a heavy smokers lungs the earth is losing its ability 
                to breathe at all. Just a few centuries ago, earths equator was 
                girdled by a green belt of 15 million sq. miles of rain forest, 
                an area about 5-times that of the USA.. Now the equivalent of 3 
                USA's worth of forests are gone! There is only 6.2 million sq. 
                miles left.<br>
                <br>
                Americans consume 22% of the world’s oil, even though they make 
                up just 5% of the world's population - as a result the past 100 
                years has seen heat trapping gases increase by 22%<br>
                <br>
                Other 'warming gases' are; methane, nitrous, oxide and 
                chloroflurocarbons (or CFC's).<br>
                <br>
                In the year AD1 there were about 250 million humans on earth. It 
                took 1,650 years for that number to double. Between 1650 and 
                1930 the human population rose 4 times to 2 billion. By the turn 
                of the century 6 billion on Earth - 3 times the population just 
                70 years earlier.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Effects</b>: Scientists have determined many of the harmful 
                local effects of air pollution. We know, for instance, that air 
                pollution can negatively impact human health and cause coughs, 
                burning eyes, breathing problems, and even death. We know that 
                atmospheric haze or smog reduces visibility and that acid rain 
                from chemical emissions damages property, pollutes water 
                resources, and can harm forests, wildlife, and agriculture.<br>
                <br>
                <b>GLOBAL WARMING</b><br>
                Cause: Scientists have spent decades trying to figure out what 
                is causing global warming. They've looked at the natural cycles 
                and events that are known to influence climate. But the amount 
                and pattern of warming that's been measured can't be explained 
                by these factors alone. The only way to explain the pattern is 
                to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by 
                humans.<br>
                <br>
                One of the first things scientists learned is that there are 
                several greenhouse gases responsible for warming, and humans 
                emit them in a variety of ways. Most come from the combustion of 
                fossil fuels in cars, factories and electricity production. The 
                gas responsible for the most warming is carbon dioxide, also 
                called CO2. Other contributors include methane released from 
                landfills and agriculture (especially from the digestive systems 
                of grazing animals), nitrous oxide from fertilizers, gases used 
                for refrigeration and industrial processes, and the loss of 
                forests that would otherwise store CO2.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Effects</b>: Globally, the mercury is already up more than 1 
                degree Fahrenheit (0.8 degree Celsius), and even more in 
                sensitive polar regions. Ice is melting worldwide, especially at 
                the Earth’s poles.<br>
                <br>
                This includes mountain glaciers, ice sheets covering West 
                Antarctica and Greenland, and Arctic sea ice. Precipitation 
                (rain and snowfall) has increased across the globe, on average. 
                Sea levels rose faster over the last century. Hurricanes and 
                other storms are likely to became stronger. Floods and droughts 
                have become more common. Some diseases are spreading rapidly, 
                such as malaria carried by mosquitoes.<br>
                <br>
                Less fresh water will be available. Ecosystems will change - 
                some species will move farther north or become more successful; 
                others won’t be able to move and could become extinct.<br>

                <b>SANITATION</b><br>
                The global sanitation sector is in a severe situation. Over 2.4 
                billion people are without access to improved sanitation 
                facilities in the world. The first step to improve this harsh 
                situation is to grasp the current situation with accuracy. Here 
                the current situation of global sanitation sector is described 
                from various angles by utilizing the following information 
                sources.<br>
                <br>
                The vast majority of people without safe water supply and 
                improved sanitation facilities are in Asia and Africa, where the 
                population has increased by 15.8% and 27.5% respectively during 
                the period 1990-2000.<br>
                <br>
                The lack of wastewater treatment is hazardous to human health 
                and the environment. In the developing regions of the world, 
                treatment is applied in only a minority of systems. Even in the 
                industrialized countries, sewage is not universally treated.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Effects</b>:<br>
                Approximately 4 billion cases of diarrhea each year cause 2.2 
                million deaths, mostly among children under the age of five.<br>
                <br>
                Intestinal worms infect about 10% of the population of the 
                developing world. These can be controlled through better 
                sanitation, hygiene and water supply. Intestinal parasitic 
                infections can lead to malnutrition, anemia and retarded growth, 
                depending upon the severity of the infection.<br>
                <br>
                It is estimated that 6 million people are blind from trachoma 
                and the population at risk from this disease is approximately 
                500 million.<br>
                <br>
                200 million people in the world are infected with 
                schistosomiasis, of whom 20 million suffer severe consequences. 
                The disease is still found in 74 countries of the world.<br>
                <br>
                <b>GLOBAL RECYCLING</b><br>
                Recycling is important to both the natural environment and us. 
                We must act fast as the amount of waste we create is increasing 
                all the time. Increasing wealth means that people are buying 
                more products and ultimately creating more waste.<br>
                <br>
                Increasing population means that there are more people on the 
                planet to create waste.<br>
                <br>
                New packaging and technological products are being developed, 
                much of these products contain materials that are not 
                biodegradable.<br>
                <br>
                New lifestyle changes, such as eating fast food, means that we 
                create additional waste that isn’t biodegradable.<br>
                <br>
                Harmful chemicals and greenhouse gasses are released from 
                rubbish in landfill sites. Recycling helps to reduce the 
                pollution caused by waste.<br>
                <br>
                Habitat destruction and global warming are some the effects 
                caused by deforestation. Recycling reduces the need for raw 
                materials so that the rainforests can be preserved.<br>
                <br>
                Huge amounts of energy are used when making products from raw 
                materials. Recycling requires much less energy and therefore 
                helps to preserve natural resources.<br>
                <br>
                Recycling is essential to cities around the world and to the 
                people living in them. There is no space for waste. Our landfill 
                sites are filling up fast, and by 2010, almost all landfills in 
                the UK will be full.<br>
                <br>
                Reduce financial expenditure in the economy. Making products 
                from raw materials costs much more than if they were made from 
                recycled products.<br>
                <br>
                Preserve natural resources for future generations. Recycling 
                reduces the need for raw materials; it also uses less energy, 
                therefore preserving natural resources for the future.<br>

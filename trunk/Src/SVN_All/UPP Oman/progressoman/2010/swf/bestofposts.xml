Editorial 

THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA 
Till July 23, 1970, Oman remained oblivious to the march of human civilisation. An isolated state, it had no relations with other Arab or Islamic countries and the same isolation pervaded all aspects of Omanis’ lives. Radios were banned, healthcare was virtually non-existent. In 1970, there was only one missionary hospital in Muttrah and a handful of admission units in Muscat. Education too cut a sorry .gure with three schools existing across the whole State. On an average one school was built every 19 years. Women endured agonies for their children who toiled in the .elds, working with primitive tools and struggling with paltry water rations.

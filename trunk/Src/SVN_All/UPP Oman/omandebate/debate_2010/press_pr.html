									only covers globalisation and economics, 
									human capital, motivation and diplomacy but

									through the idea of a new age of leadership 
									in a changing business landscape, and 
									economic trends indicating a slowdown in 
									major world markets. In addition, the 
									diverse speaker lineup will share key 
									insights into the way businesses in the new 
									age have to show responsibility to their 
									social environment.<br>
